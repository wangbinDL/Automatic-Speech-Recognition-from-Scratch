WHEN YOU'RE COOKING CHIPS AT HOME
THE TRADITIONAL CHIP PAN OFTEN STAYS ON THE SHELF
THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL A KNIFE BLOCK
WHICH INVOLVES FIRING A POTATO DOWN A PIPE
APART FROM THE GOLDEN COLOUR AND THE DELICIOUS FLAVOUR
WHAT REALLY MAKES A CHIP A CHIP IS THE CRUNCH
FRESH OUT THE FRYER
AS PEANUTS GROW UNDERGROUND
THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF MEAT
I COULD LABEL THIS ON THE INGREDIENTS AS MEAT
THE INSIDE SHOULD BE NICE AND SOFT AND REALLY OOZE OUT
AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT FISH
SOMETIMES YES IT MIGHT NOT BE THE PRETTIEST FISH
IT MIGHT EVEN BE UGLY WITH THE HEAD ON
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM
THE FIRST STAGE IS MASHING
AND BEING GIVEN HEAVY METAL POISONS
WAS FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE
MISS FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE IS NOW STAYING AT DR GULLY'S WATER CURE ESTABLISHMENT IN MALVIN
SHE WAS VERY WELL KNOWN BECAUSE HER FAMILY WERE VERY
BUT SHE WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT THAT WORK SHOULD BE
AFTER THE CRIMEAN WAR
AND FOR ESTABLISHING NURSING AS A TRUE PROFESSION
BUT WHEN SHE VISITED HERE
SHE WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A CURE FOR HERSELF
BUT SHE WASN'T VERY WELL THEN
BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE MISS NIGHTINGALE IN THE WHOLE WORLD THEN
SO EVERYBODY FOUND OUT WHERE SHE WAS AND ALL THE NEWSPAPERS SAID
HE WAS VERY CLEVER
THE WHOLE FAMILY WERE VERY VERY
IS THERE ARE NO COLOURS OR LIGHTS THAT STAND OUT
AM I WRITING THEIR MUSIC
ON HIS DEATHBED
I WAS HELPED AT THE BEGINNING BY A COMMITTEE
JUST TURN UP BETWEEN CERTAIN HOURS
AND I DO A SHORT SHOW ON DEMAND
AND THEREFORE PROBABLY MAGICALLY
AND TO SACRIFICE IT IN THE EVENT OF A GERMAN INVASION
SO IN THE FUTURE
BUT HOW WELL THEY WERE PREPARED AS WELL
AND BIRMINGHAM BEING THE THE GREAT INDUSTRIAL AREA SINCE VICTORIAN TIMES WITH THE BLACK COUNTRY
EVEN CIVILIAN THINGS LIKE GAS MASKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
DEFEND THE RIVERBANK
BUT OVER THE PAST EVEN TEN YEARS
WE'VE MANAGED TO GATHER A LOT MORE INFORMATION SO
WINSTON CHURCHILL WAS PRIME MINISTER WHEN IT WAS FIRST BROADCAST NOW
AND REVOLVES AROUND A FARMING FAMILY
SURELY YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS BY NOW
BUT IF YOU STILL HAD ANY DOUBTS
NOW IT'S BROADCAST ON BBC RADIO FOUR FROM SUNDAYS TO FRIDAYS
IS BECAUSE WE RECORD TWENTY FOUR EPISODES IN SIX DAYS
UM WHICH IS A MONTH'S AIR TIME
WE'RE NOT IN EACH OTHER'S POCKETS EVERY DAY
EVERYONE HAS ENTANGLEMENTS
AND THEN WHEN WE GOT OFF IN LONDON SAID
AND THE ARCHERS LOST THIS EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO
BUT STILL PRIDES ITSELF IN ITS REFLECTION OF RURAL LIFE
THAT LOVABLE ROGUE
AND IT TAKES A LOT MORE THAN I IMAGINED
TO BE SURE THAT I WILL GET
WHO IS REALLY DOMINANT TO HIM
THEY'RE UP HERE WHATEVER THE WEATHER
THEY SHOULD MAKE PUMPKIN PIES
NOT BECAUSE HE WANTS TO MAKE THEM INTO A PIE OR BLEND THEM INTO A SOUP
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PUMPKIN CARBON WORLD RECORDS
AND IT'S IT'S A BIG RECORD
I CAN ASSURE YOU
YOU CAN'T KEEP WHAT YOU BUY
WHAT DO YOU THINK
TWO EX MILITARYLI MEN
YOUD HAVE A FOLIO STAND LIKE THIS
WHICH WAS MADE FOR INDIVIDUAL SHEETS
CONTAINING A MAP OF THE STARS
DESCRIBING THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD
NOT A BAD LITTLE
I DO AGREE WITH YOU
I WANT THEM TO DONATE
PUT HER MAKEUP ON
ISSUE A FEW LAST MINUTE INSTRUCTIONS AND WALK OFF
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS
WE WANT DECENT WORKING CONDITIONS FOR EMPLOYEES
WE WENT INTO FIRE FIGHTING BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT FIREIGHT WE MAY HAVE ABSOLUTELY LOUSY PAY WE MAY BE FACING WORKING
WE ARE A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF YOU THE POSTAL WORKERS GOT THE RIGHT TERMS CONDITIONS IF THEY
SO WHY BLAME THE STRIKERS
WHERE YOU DRAW THE LINE
THEY STILL HAVE SOME MUSCLES TO FLEX BUT AS WE ALL FACE UP TO CUTS
WITH THE COUNTRY ALREADY UNDER THE COSH
ARE STRIKES JUSTIFIED OR JUST THE TACTICS OF BULLY BOY UNIONS
SAYING THE UNIONS AREN'T PART OF THE PUBLIC
THEY ARE THEYVE DEMOCRATICALLY VOTED TO STRIKE
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE
MORAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK
I LONG FOR THE DAY WHEN CHRISTIANS ARE KNOWN BY THEIR LOVE
NOT BY THEIR OPT OUTS
YOU LOOK AT THE REALITY IN THIS COUNTRY
AND AND THE POLICE WERE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEM
HE WASN'T BREAKING THE LAW
HAD TO DRESS AS MUSLIMS
TO OR WORKING CONDITIONS
AND MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THIS
THIS IS MEAT THAT'S PREPARED FOR MUSLIMS
BUT THEY HAVE ALL GONE OVER TO HAL OUR MEAT
THEY ARE THE POOR
AND THIS POINT REALLY MAKES ME EXPLODE
IT'S GREAT TO BE PART OF A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY BUT THE FACT IS THAT BRITAIN IS A CHRISTIAN
NOW AS A JEWISH PERSON
I BUY KOHER MEAT BUT I DON'T EXPECT KFC TO HAVE IT ON THEIR MENU
IF I WANT TO HAVE COACH
KEEPING ATHEISTS OUT OF PARLIAMENT
THEY SHOULD NOT STRIKE BUT TERMINATE IT
PEOPLE MAY SAY WELL THAT'S AN EXTREME EXTREME EXAMPLE
BUT THE PROBLEM IS
YOU SO IT'S IT'S NOT THE DOMAIN OF THE WORKERS THAT THEY ARE SOLELY VIOLENT
WE HAVEN'T HEARD THE FULL STORY ABOUT WHAT B MANAGEMENT HAVE DONE TO STAFF
THAT IS THE VOTE IN OUR TEXT POLL THIS MORNING
BEFORE THE POLL CLOSES
THIS WEEK THE HIGH COURT HEARD CHRISTIANS CLAIM THEY WERE BANNED FROM FOSTERING BECAUSE THEY
OTHER HIGH PROFILE CHRISTIANS
BISHOPS AMONG THEM
ALISON RUOFF IS A CONSERVATIVE EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN
SHE SHARES THOSE FEARS
YOU CAN VIRTUALLY DO ANYTHING IN THIS COUNTRY
SOCIETY BENDS OVER BACKWARDS TO ACCOMMODATE ONE
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE ARE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO WEAR SYMBOLS OF OUR CHRISTIAN FAITH
DESPITE THEIR BEING VERY MUCH IN THE MINORITY
THE SECRETIVE INTRODUCTION OF HALAL MEAT
FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS AH IS A BASIC PRINCIPLE OF ANY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY
AT THE SAME TIME
I THINK I MAY HAVE LOST TOUCH WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SINCE BEING IN THE WHITE HOUSE
I WISH I WAS BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
THURSDAY IS ARMISTICE DAY
MANY OF US ARE WEARING POPPIES TO COMMEMORATE SOLDIERS SACRIFICES BUT IS THE POP
THEIR JOB IS TO IMPLEMENT THE WAR EFFECTIVELY
HISTORY IS WOMEN IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY S WHO LOST FATHERS
IS TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO PEACE
NOT THE ONES ON OTHER SIDES WHO DIED OR PERHAPS EVEN OUR ALLIES
THEY NEED TO MOVE WITH THE TIMES
I JUST SAY IT HOW IT IS
IF YOU THINK IT IS
THEY HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME AGAINST SOCIETY IN SOME WAY OR OTHER AGAINST THE NATION
I WOULD LIKE TO TO SAY THAT
ACTUALLY MY FATHER WAS IN NORMANDY
THEY TELL ME STORIES AND WE KNOW ABOUT THE BOMBING OF DRESDEN
THE SHAMEFUL THINGS THAT HAPPEN BY OUR SIDE
THE BEST WAY TO REMEMBER IS TO COMMIT TO PEACE
YOU MAY WELL HAVE A VIEW ON THAT
PLEASE DO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR WEBSITE
STRIKING IS NOT WRONG
I THINK YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE THAT ULTIMATE DECISION TO MAKE
HAVING SAID THAT
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT
BUT I THINK THERE'S STILL HUGE RESPECT FOR THE POPPY
HAVE LAID DOWN THEIR LIVES FOR OUR FREEDOM
YOU MEAN ALTHOUGH WE ARE STILL ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN YOU KNOW TWO WARS
BUT ALSO I WEAR A POPPY IN GRATEFUL RECOGNITION FOR THE MILITARY WHO ARE NOW BEING NOT ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE
LOST LIMBS AND AND WILL NEVER HAVE THE SAME SORT OF LIFE AGAIN
I'VE GROWN OLD LOOKING AT THEM
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH FOR OUR OWN DEMANDS
WITH THE RESTAURANTS
THAT'S NOT THE CASE NOWADAYS
EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD QUALITY
THE MORE EFFICIENT
IF THERE WERE PREDATORS HERE
A VERY EARLY CLOCK
IT'S LIKE AH LIKE A SUNDIAL
IF WE CAN DO A DEAL WITH THEM TO GET A COUPLE OF NEW TRAINS
WHICH IS REALLY SAD
AND HAS SPAWNED A THOUSAND IMITATIONS
UNDERNEATH A SUBURBAN HOUSE IN MARGATE
I WORRY ABOUT IT A LOT
ANY THAT THERE IS
AND PEOPLE REALLY DO ACTUALLY RESPECT IT
THEY'LL GET THAT NICE LITTLE BALL PATCH AT THEIR BASE AND
I'LL BE FINDING OUT WHY
AND IN FACT WE ACTUALLY DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH LATELY AND
BECAUSE GREATER LONDON IS NOW FORMED ON ITS OWN LIKE ITS OWN COUNTY
MATT'S GETTING A LESSON IN A TRADITIONAL CRAFT
WE'LL BE CATCHING UP WITH HIM IN A WE WHILE
MACKEREL FISHING HAS LONG BEEN ONE OF THE MOST PROFITABLE INDUSTRIES IN THE UK
THIS MULTI MILLIONLLION POUND BUSINESS IS UNDER THREAT
TOM HEAP IS IN SCOTLAND INVESTIGAT
BUT ACROSS THE WORLD THEY
NOT THAT WELL KNOWN IN SURREY
MANAGEMENT YOU'VE CALLED US ON A BREAD AND BUTTER DAY TODAY
NOW OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS
SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU
THEY STILL FOLLOW THE SAME ROUTES THAT THEY DID BEFORE
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT YOU WEAVING SOME OF MY WOOL HERE
AND THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR THE WOOL OFF MY SHEEP'S BACKS
AH CHILDREN IN NEED SUPPORTS ALL KINDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE
YOUR GENEROSITY IS VITAL TO THAT WORK
SO HE IS A REMINDER OF HOW YOU CAN BUY THE COUNTRYFILE CALENDAR AND DO YOUR BIT ONCE AGAIN
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING
STILL GOING TO NEED TO TRAIN OFFICERS
BUT IT'S OUT HERE ON THE ONE THOUSAND
THE SATELLITE PICTURE IS A BEAUTY
WE'VE KIND OF WALKED AWAY
THE DOKING IS A RARE BREED AND
THE WET WEATHER ALL SPIRALLING AROUND THAT AREA OF LOW PRESSURE THERE COULD BE SOME PRETTY HEAVY SHOWERS
WE SHOULD AVOID A FROST
SOME OF WHICH COULD BE HEAVY
SOMETHING BRIGHTER WE SHOULD GET SOME AUTUMN SUNSHINE
LOTS OF SHOWERS COMING ALONG THE COAST OF NORTH EAST ENGLAND
AND BACK IN THE DAY
RAIN ON AND OFF THROUGH THE DAY ACCOMPANIED BY STRONG
THE TRENCHES GAVE A LOT OF PROTECTION
THERE WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL DIMENSION TO THE SAFETY
MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF YEARS
VERY WEAK GRAVITY
YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY INDIVIDUAL SITES ON THE COMET THAT ARE THE SOURCE OF THESE JETS
COMETS CAN BE EXCITING AND
THE SUN'S HEAT WILL HEAT THE SURFACE AND
AND BECAUSE IT'S MOSTLY COMPOSED OF ICE
AND WHEN IT'S IN THE NIGHT SIDE OF THE COMET
BUT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY TRY AND FIND COMET HARTLEY TWO
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE SKY TO GET AS DARK AS IT CAN POSSIBLY
THAT'S GOING TO BE A MANIC DAY
AND LET'S REMEMBER THAT
LISA TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE IS INDECISIVE
OK MASTER BEDROOM
IT DOESN'T HAVE THEM
THAT'S NOT A DEAL BREAKER
I THINK IF A ONE BED HAD THE RIGHT SORT OF WOW FACTOR
IT'S ONLY ABOUT FOUR YEARS OLD
YOU FACTOR IT
YOU KNOW IT'S THERE
IT'S A REALLY BIG FLAT
IT'S BEEN DONE REALLY NICELY
THAT'S A LOCAL LINE
IF YOU'RE WATCHING AND YOU NEED A MAN TO BE THE STANDARD BEARER AT THE TWENTY TWELVE OLYMPICS BECAUSE OF MY
AND IF YOU PEOPLE AT HOME WOULD LIKE TO BE PART OF NEXT TIME
WE CAN SHOW OFF AND BE LIKE
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE ABOUT
THAT'S THE WORST PART
THEY WANT THREE BEDROOMS MINIMUM
IS VERY MUCH THE FAIRIES IN THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
MAYBE IT'S JUST THE ENVIRONMENT THAT FAIRIES MIGHT GO TO
WHY DON'T YOU STICK TO WHAT YOU KNOW THEN
GEORGE CLARKE SIMPSON
WAS BORN RIGHT HERE IN DERBY
WELCOME TO SPON
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF FUN
VERY VERY CLEVER WITH THE WORDS THERE
CENTRAL AND CENTRAL
BUT THE QUESTION IS
OFF ROAD BARKING FOR TWO CARS
FAIRIES WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT IS
I WONDER WHERE I MIGHT HANG MY ART COLLECTION
HERE THEY ARE IMAGINING THEMSELVES IN THIS PROPERTY
THE WHOLE HOUSE NEEDS FRESHENING UP
HERE WE GO ADDED BONUS THERE
I DID ONCE AT A PARTY BUT
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT WOULD IMPACT ON THE ROOM
BUT YOU COULD DO IT
SO IF YOU COULD DO THAT
WE WILL SEE YOU LATER ON
IF YOU SEE ANY FAIRIES
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THIS IS SOMETHING THEY HAVEN'T DONE YET THEY HAVE IMAGINED THEIR FURNITURE
FROM THAT LAST STATEMENT
AND THE MAN IS EXPANDING THE PROPERTY OUT
YOU'D HOPE TO SEE ONE IN THE HOUSE
YOU CHOSE MY ONE
IF YOU WOULD LIKE JOHN AND I TO MAYBE HELP YOU FIND THE PROPERTY OF YOUR DREAMS
I SHALL SPEND SOME OF THE MONEY AND
NOT WHAT IS IN THE HEART
THE MERCHANTS SIMPLY THOUGHT BECAUSE IT CAME FROM THE EAST
IT ALL CAME FROM JAPAN
TOWARDS THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THOUGH
LITERALLY MILLIONS OF BIKES BEING CHURNED OUT IN THE LOCAL INDUSTRIES HAD TO BE DECORATED
MAINLY DARK BLACK
WELL TALKING ABOUT BIKES
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PAPIER MACHE TODAY OVER AT BANTOK HOUSE IN WOLVERHAMPTON
ONE HUNDRED AND TEN POUNDS IN THE DOORWAY
BECAUSE TO SURVIVE THEY HAD TO FIGHT
WE'VE BEEN ENEMIES IN THE PAST
BUT ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BETWEEN US THAN DIVIDES US
HE WOULD FIGHT TILL THE END
CERTAINLY WITHOUT THE INDIAN ARMY CONTRIBUTION AND
AND THIS IS HOW THEY WERE TREATED
AND TO PUSH UP ITALY TOWARDS THE HEARTLAND OF EUROPE
PART OF THAT ACTUALLY
AND CERTAINLY HIS GRANDFATHER
HAD THE SUPPORT
I WOULDN'T SAY HE WAS BAD BUT HE WAS NOT
AFTER THE MARRIAGE
MAKE SURE YOU'RE TREATING PEOPLE RIGHT
TO ENABLE THAT HE'D PICK THEM ALL UP
WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THAT VEGETABLE OR THAT FRUIT SENT OVER AND THEN THERE WAS A LITTLE THERE WAS A FUNERAL
IT STARTED TO BUILD MORE AND MORE AND MORE
IT WAS MORE ATTRACTIVE I THINK FOR PEOPLE TO COME TO THIS AREA BECAUSE THEY COULD SEE THEIR OTHER NEEDS
WE NEED ONE PLACE
THE COUNCIL SAY
AND MY JOB WAS TO GO WITH MY GRANDDAD
HOW TO WRITE BASIC ARABIC
ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO READ THE KORAN AND ALSO HAVE ISLAMIC BASIC EDUCATION ON ISLAM
LOVELY MAN BUT GOT INVOLVED IN SO MANY THINGS WITHOUT BEING
THE MAJORITY OF THEIR FAMILY WAS BACK HOME
SO IF THEY DIED OVER HERE
OF WHICH WE HAD TO DEAL WITH A COUPLE OF CASES
WHEN I WAS ON MY WAY TO SCHOOL
I DON'T REALLY BLAME HER FOR SAYING STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MEDIA PORTRAYS US IN A WAY WHERE
SO WE HAVE LECTURES IN SOMALI NOW
LECTURES IN ARABIC
IF ONLY THAT COULD BE PALESTINE NOW
THOUGH THE CHANCES OF THEM BUYING SAID PROPERTY
YOU NEED TO GET TO THE BATHROOM FIRST
MY DAUGHTER DOES
WE ARE CHEAPER THAN
AND LONDON IS CERTAINLY LEADING THE WAY WITH ANNUAL INCREASES OF AROUND SIX
ANDY IS IN THE BETTING GAME
I WOULD SAY ONE OF THEM
AND BECAUSE YOU'RE NEAREST
IT'S NOT A FLAT
AS A BETTING MAN
THE ACTUAL PRICE OF THIS PROPERTY
THEY ALREADY PREFER MY PROPERTY
THIS IS A TWO BEDROOM MAISONETTE NEAR A BUS STOP
WE REALLY WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF
OR IS IT ANOTHER RECEPTION ROOM
BECAUSE I THINK WITH AN HOUR COMMUTE TO WORK
WE HAVE GONE OVER THE TOP OF THAT
BECAUSE THIS ONE
IT IS THE BIGGEST DECISION OF THEIR ADULT LIVES
I'M NOT A GAMBLING MAN
AND IF YOU KIND PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO BE PART OF THAT SUCCESS STORY
IS THERE GOING TO BE A HAPPY ENDING TODAY
IN THE HEART OF WALES
WHICH MADE ME INTERESTED IN GOING GETTING STUFF FROM AUCTION I
I'VE BEEN TO A FEW PLACES
NOW THESE STRAW CHAIRS WERE MADE
RIGHT UP UNTIL THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR DENOMINATION IS
WHAT GOTWA GOT TO ME WAS THE STAR WARS MEMORABILIA
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
THIS PROGRAMME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES LONG AND WE LIKE TO TRY TO COVER AT LEAST ONE TOPIC FROM A VARIETY OF
IT'S NOT A TREND FOR THAT REASON
BECAUSE IT WAS A VERY SPECIFIC STORY TELLING DEVICE FOR THIS FILM
UM IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'D NORMALLY DO IN A PANORAMA
THE BBC HAS MARKED REMEMBRANCE WEEK WITH A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS
STARTING OFF IN DAYTIME
WE'LL CHECK IF THERE IS TO BE A REPEAT AND OF COURSE
IT IS STILL AVAILABLE ON IPLAYER
MAYBE THE TIMING OF THE ACTUAL BROADCAST MATTERS LESS THESE DAYS
A DIFFERENT SLICE OF BRITISH HISTORY HAS BEEN UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT IN RECENT WEEKS
AND THE SCHEDULING POINT WHICH WE HAVE WITH THE SECRET REMEMBRANCE PROGRAMME CROPS UP WITH OTHERS
ANDREA MARSHALL IS CONCERNED THAT TORMENTED LIVES
BUT FOR ONE VIEWER
YOU CAN TAKE THINGS TOO FAR
WAS HIDDEN AWAY LATE AT NIGHT IN MAINLAND UK SCHEDULES
BUT ALTHOUGH LATER'S LATEST HEADLINE ACT HAD BEEN ON THE VERY MAINSTREAM STRICTLY THREE NIGHTS EARLIER
ALL THE EGOS DISAPPEAR
THAT'S ALL WE CAN PACK IN THIS WEEK
AS THE DE NUMBERS INCREASE
BECAUSE THEY TASTE JUST THE SAME
THE SPANISH ARE BIG WITH THEM
IF WE HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THEM
BRINGING THE MOISTURE FROM THE RE FROM THE WEST
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING'S BEEN
WE DO HAVE THE THREAT OF SOME SHOWERS
SO WE AVOID THE FROST BY WEDNESDAY MORNING
WE ARE CONTENDING WITH FROST
I NEEDED SOMEWHERE TO FLY
YOU'RE LIKE KING OR SOMETHING
IT IS A TOTAL FIERCE FEST
I LIKE NORTH KOREA
SHE THREW HERSELF INTO THE SOLDIER'S ARMS
GIVING HERSELF TO HIM
I CRIED WHEN THEY CAUGHT ME
THEY MUST NEVER FIND OUT
WE'RE LIKE ROMEO AND JULIET
IT'S AN ACTUAL ICEBERG
OF COURSE NO ONE CAN SAVE US CERTAINLY IT'S GOING TO HIT US
BUT MY SOURCES TELL ME THAT
FOR THOSE OF US WHO SURVIVE
THERE'S NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD LISTEN TO ANYTHING WE WOULD WANT AT ALL
WHAT IS THE NAME
NOT ACTUALLY RHYMING SLANG
THE CORRECT ANSWER WAS
IF I WERE SOME KIND OF DESSERT
AND THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED
AND HOW DO THEY WRAP UP THIS RUBBISH
WE ARE BACK NEXT WEEK WITH CENTREELLA
WHICH IS AN ARGUMENT WAITING TO HAPPEN
THEN SOMETHING ABOUT A COW THAT JUMPS OVER THE MOON
WHICH WOULD NEVER HAPPEN
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO MAYBE PUT YOUR BAG DOWN
YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN A BETTER PLACE AND
PLENTY OF PEOPLE STILL LIVED IN SLUMS
I HAD ONE MYSELF
THE TOWN PLANNERS IN SHEFFIELD RECKONED THE ONLY WAY WAS UP
HOW MANY OF THESE HAVE YOU DONE NOW
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF OBJECTS THAT ABSOLUTELY EPITOMISE THE TIME
WE'VE PUT TOGETHER A FEW HIGHLIGHTS TO REFLECT WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE TELLY AND CINEMA AS THE
EVERY MONDAY AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO READ YOU YOUR OWN LETTERS
I WANT TO SEE THEM DOING SOMETHING
OFF ROADAD PARKING
GARAGE NOT REALLY A PROBLEM
THREE WOULD BE GREAT
NEVER BELIEVE ANYTHING THEY PUT IN THE PRESS
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO NEW BUILDS
ALL IS NOT LOST
GREAT BARR'S FINEST ESTATE AGENT
WHICH WOULD BE LOVELY
IT IS OVER BUDGET
BUT I THINK WITH MORE WORK AND THAT SCARES ME A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE TO DEFINITELY
I'M NOT SURE AT THIS STAGE
YOUR MAXIMUM BUDGET
IT TAKES ALL THE BOXES
ONE GORGEOUS ONE
ONE KIND OF STANDARD
ONE IN BUDGET AND SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT
MY TABLE MY KITCHEN TABLE WOULD FIT
WHICH WOULD BE GREAT
I WORK FROM AN OFFICE AND I SEE PEOPLE AT HOME
I LIVE IN PLYMOUTH
I'M THIRTY ONE FROM BIRMINGHAM
BUT TO GET THE PRIZE MONEY
AND ANYBODY SHOULD APPLY
ESPECIALLY ALL MY FRIENDS AT HOME
SO I FEEL QUITE HONOURABLE TO HAVE GONE OUT ON THAT QUESTION
I'M KICKING MYSELF ABOUT THE NURSERY RHYME QUESTION
BECAUSE I REALLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THE ANSWER TO THAT
EVERYONE SAYS SHE'S THE QUEEN OF MEAN
THAT THE OTHERS DON'T HAVE
I ALSO THINK THAT IS ACCOMPANIED BY HIM BEING VERY
I'M HERE TO WIN
I KNOW IT'S MODERN AS WELL
DID THEY CONSULT WITH THEIR EXPERT
WE'RE OFF SOMEWHERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
AND TO COVER UP THEIR BAD BREATH
THERE IS A MARKET FOR THOSE
I COME FROM NORTHAMPTON AND I AM A THEATRE COMPANY MANAGER
BUT SECOND ROUND IS PRETTY CLOSE
GOING BE FULL OF PRAISE
THAT SHE'S PROBABLY QUITE JEALOUS THAT I'VE GOT ABOUT TEN TIMES MORE THAN SHE HAS
I HAD JUST LEFT THE ROYAL COLLEGE
WE'RE CONCENTRATING ON NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR AND NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AND HEARING SOME MORE PERSONAL STORIES OF
FOR ROBIN WILSON
I MEAN THE FLAT WASN'T PRIVATE
LONDON WAS THE CENTRE OF THE WORLD FOR FASHION
BUT IF YOU LIVED ANYWHERE ELSE
RIGHT IN THE FRONT OF THE DRESS
AND JUST BEFORE I WENT OUT
AND YOU CAN'T GO OUT LIKE THAT
THEY COULDN'T AND THEY USED TO COME DOWN TO BENWELL
AND THEY WOULD COME DRESSED RESPECTABLE AND THEY WOULD LEAVE ALL OF THEIR MINI EASE AT MY HOUSE AND
EVERYTHING HAD TO BE PERFECT
WELCOME TO MATCH OF THE DAY
AND I REMEMBER I HAD WANTED A GRECIAN STYLE
AND IN THOSE DAYS
BUT THAT'S IN SIXTY NINE
WHAT WAS YOUR FAVOURITE RECORD OF THE WEEK
BECAUSE I NEVER HAD LIKED BRITISH POP STARS UNTIL THEM
THE SCOOTER HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC OBJECTS OF THE SIXTY S
ENJOY EXCITING NEW EXPERIENCES
THE LOOK OF THE FILM THE KNACK WAS VERY
DRIVEN BY FASHION
MUSIC AND MACHINES
ON THE BACK OF IT
ONCE IT BECAME COMMERCIALISED
TO TRY BEFORE THEY BUY
KNOW EVERYTHING WE DO NOW IS FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE
THAT'S GOING TO COST MONEY
THEY WANTED A DOUBLE GARAGE
IT'S NOT A TYPICAL ESTATE HOUSE BECAUSE ONE IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DESIGN
IS PERFECT FOR THE FELLAS
I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS PROPERTY
I THINK IT WILL TAKE SOME BEATING
DESPITE ITS SIZE AND HOUSE POWER
AND A BEAUTIFUL MATURE GARDEN
I LOVE THAT SHOWER
IT MADE ME REALLY APPRECIATE
THEY DON'T ALL HAVE TO BE RED HOT
IT WAS A DECADE OF MASSIVE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHANGE BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO LIVED THROUGH IT
NOW THE SIXTY S MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN A GREAT TIME FOR MANY
BUT FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE WELSH VALLEYS
ONE OCTOBER MORNING
A SMALL MINING COMMUNITY WAS TO BE CAUGHT UP IN AN UNIMAGINABLE
AND WITH ME IN THE STUDIO TO SHARE SOME OF HIS MEMORIES WITH US
THE VERY FIRST DJ TO BROADCAST ON RADIO ONE
NOW I SAT RIGHT IN THE FRONT
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER NEWS HEADLINES IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AND SIXTY SEVEN ALONG WITH SOME OF THE MUSIC
GAYNOR'S RECOLLECTION WAS VERY TOUCHING
AND THE ROAD SHOWS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
THERE WAS A REAL NEED TO HAVE MUSIC AROUND US THE WHOLE TIME AND SOME BRILLIANT NEW GADGETS WERE
SO WE SENT OUR COLLECTIBLES EXPERT
BUT I GOT THE JOB
I WAS OUT ON RADIO CAROLINE
SAID THERE'S THIS STATION COMING ON CALLED RADIO ONE
SAID THEY'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN YOU FOR IT
I CAN MAKE YOU THE TOP DISC JOCKEY IN THREE MONTHS
IT WAS VERY STRANGE
BECAUSE ALL THE PRODUCERS AND ALL THE PEOPLE THERE THEY WERE ALL DRESSED IN THE FLOWERY GEAR
WHO WAS THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER THERE
I SAW THE WHO LIVE
AND I THOUGHT MY MOTHER DIDN'T KNOW
AND THERE WAS ALL THAT BUSINESS ABOUT THE
I COMPLETELY FROZE
AND SO THEY DID
OVER THE COURSE OF THOSE TEN YEARS
BECAUSE I'M A FOODIE
AND IN FACT MY SON'S IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS TOO
YOU COULDN'T DO THAT
I'LL HAVE JOHN CRAVEN WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO
THEY GET THE CHANCE TO SAMPLE ONE OF OUR THREE PRECIOUS PROPERTY GEMS AND THEN STEP OUT ONTO THE PLAIN AS WE GIVE
YEAH MEAN DAUGHTERS AND SONS BETWEEN YOU
TO CELEBRATE THE GREAT MAN
GOOD ADVICE RE HOUSE HUNTER
BECAUSE THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE
WE DIDN'T HEAR IT
IT WAS ON THE MARKET AT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND
BUT TO FORCE A SALE
WOULD BE FORMED
AND IT'S RESTORED
AND BEAT IT WITHIN THIS SUPER COLD ENVIRONMENT
YOU READY FOR THIS
YOU HAVE TO CROSS EVERYTHING
THE LATE SIXTY S WAS AN AMAZING TIME TO LIVE THROUGH
EVERYTHING IN THE UK WAS CHANGING SO FAST
WE ARE REACHING THE END OF THE DECADE
FOCUSING ON THE EVENTS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND SIXTY NINE
AND BY THAT STAGE I WAS ALREADY PREGNANT AGAIN
ON THIS OCCASION
IT WASN'T UNTIL THERE WAS THE ADVENT AND RELIABLE
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT WE STILL HAD A LORD CHAMBERLAIN WHO SENSEED EVERY THEATRE SCRIPT AND HAD
BUT THIS ANTIQUATED LAW DIDN'T REALLY FIT IN OUR NEW
GO AND AUDITION FOR THAT
AND THAT'S THE TERRIBLE
THING BECAUSE IGNORANCE IS THE WORST THING
THAT'S WHY VI THE SHOW'S A SUCCESS
AND THE BAND PLAYED ON AND AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER
TO GO ON THE PILL SAYS
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE KEY STORIES OF THE DECADE
IF YOU HAD A RELATIONSHIP OUTSIDE MARRIAGE
SO YOU FORGET OUT OF WHAT KIND OF
LIKE THE WAR IN VIETNAM
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CAREER IN FILM
PROGRAMME MAKERS WERE COMING UP WITH SOME PRETTY GROUNDBREAKING TV
IT GAVE A CLUE TO THE MOST INCREDIBLE BREAKTHROUGH IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS ABOUT TO
I THINK EVEN NOW
WE'RE GOING TO BED NOW WE' HAD ENOUGH
THANKS FOR WATCHING
IT'S GOING TO BE AN UPHILL STRUGGLE
VERY CLOSE FRIENDS
THE PEAK DISTRICT NATIONAL PARK AUTHORITY SPECIFIED THAT ANY PERMISSIONS GRANTED FOR THE BUILDING
BUT GENERALLY FOR THE EXCLUSIVE PURCHASE OF THE LOCAL PEOPLE AND THEY WERE THE FIRST NATIONAL PARK
AND TODAY I TRULY THINK I HAVE PEAKED WITH MY CHOICE
THE BAR'S BEEN SET PRETTY HIGH
THEY DID SAY THEY PREFER THAT OLDER PROPERTY IT IS A MODERN PROPERTY
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE
I'M DOING ALL RIGHT
THANKS FOR YOUR BACKUP
NOT ONLY IS THERE PLENTY OF SPACE THAT'S THE SAME DIMENSIONS AS THE LOUNGE
INCLUDING A FRIDGE FREEZER AND A DISHWASHER
WHEREAS IS THE BATHROOM AT MY CHOICE WAS A COMPACT
THANK YOU FOR THAT
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT IT AND ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT MORE
BECAUSE MOST MARRIAGES THAT BREAK DOWN
BREAKDOWN RELATIVELY EARLY ON
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO IT WAS AND WHAT THE CONTEXT
IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON SOMETHING CHALLENGING
WHICH MARRIAGE IS
WILL YOU TAKE THIS WOMAN
WE ARE PUTTING MUCH MORE EMPHASIS ON THE CELEBRATION
I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM WITH THAT
WORKING THROUGH THE DIFFICULT THINGS
EVOLUTION DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE WORLD AROUND US
IT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR SOCIETY TO FUNCTION
OR PERHAPS THEY GET REMARRI SOMEBODY ELSE
AGAIN WITH MANY MANY VALID EXCEPTIONS
A BISHOP IS UNDER FIRE THIS MORNING FOR SAYING OF THE MARRIAGE OF WILLS AND KATE
YOU MIGHT THINK
BUT THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE
NOT LEAST ROYAL ONES
GO AGAINST VATICAN TEACHING
TO HAVE A MUCH MORE LIVING CHURCH
MOST OF THE TIME I AM CONSCIOUS OF HOW MUCH I HAVE IN COMMON WITH MY ROMAN CATHOLIC BROTHERS AND SISTERS
BUT IF YOU ARE ALREADY BREAKING THE CHURCH'S TEACHING IN SUCH A MAMMOTH WAY
TO SAY THAT CONDOMS
BUT THERE ARE ALREADY TWO FILMS BEING MADE OF THE DREADFUL EVENTS WHICH LED TO THE KILLING OF MEREDITH
I HAVE QUITE STRONG VIEWS ABOUT THIS
SOME PEOPLE TAKE THEIR INSPIRATION FROM REAL STORIES IN THE HEADLINES
IF YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR HEAD THAT YOU CAN'T WALK AWAY
THE SELF SACRIFICERIFIC
THE THE THE VICAR WHO PREPARED US
SIDES OF A STORY
BUT SOME VERY GOOD WRITERS
TURNED INTO ENTERTAINMENT
IF SOMETHING IS SUBDUICE
I'M VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THE WAY THAT I WRITE ABOUT VIOLENCE
FILM IS ESSENTIALLY VISUAL MEDIUM
THE BAD GUYS GET PUT AWAY
THERE'S SOMETHING QUITE COMFORTING ABOUT THIS
SHOULD MARRIAGE VOWS BE BINDING
SO PLEASE DO NOT TEXT
THE BOOK CHANGED EVERYTHING
SOME EVEN SAW IT AS A DEAL BREAKER WITH GOD
CREATIONIST PHIL ROBINSON HAS NO TRUCK WITH DARWIN
I BELIEVE THE BIBLE TO BE INSPIRED BY GOD
FOR THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TO WATCH THIS AND
FACT THERE' IS NOTHING NEW ABOUT IT
I AM UNCOMFORTABLE
BECAUSE IT IS PART OF OUR CATHARSIS
IT INVESTIGATES THIS AND ENABLES US TO TO COME TO TERMS WITH IT
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT WE ARE WRITING AS FICTION CAN HAVE A DIRECT AND VERY PAINFUL IMPACT ON THE
BUT GOING BACK TO SHAKESPEARE
BUT NEVERTHELESS HE IS EXAMINING THE HUMAN CONDITION AND
IF A CASE IS STILL LIVE
AH WE ASKED SHOULD MARRIAGE VOWS BE BINDING
TEXTED IN SAID YES THEY SHOULD
AND SEVENTEEN PERCENT SAID NO THEY SHOULDN'T
MARRIAGE IS THE MOST WONDERFULLY SATISFYING RELATIONSHIP
PROFESSOR ANDY MCINTOSH IS A PROFESSOR OF THERMODYNAMICS
MY QUESTION WAS
GOOD IT IS IT'S CREATED BY GOD
WE HAVE JUST HEARD FROM A RESPECTABLE SCIENTIST
THE ASIAN ELEPHANT NOW SUFFERING
YOU ARE SPECIFICALLY A KEEPER OF ELEPHANTS
YOU DON'T DO ANY OTHER ANIMALS HERE
SO WE DIDN'T HAVE THINGS LIKE FOREIGN HOLIDAYS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
THEY ARE SUCH FANTASTIC ANIMALS
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY LET ME GET SO CLOSE
BUT AS SOON AS YOU GET AWAY FROM HERE
WE IS IN GIANT COUNTRY NOW
GIANTS IS EVERYWHERE AROUND
AND THAT MEANT THAT WALTER COULD AFFORD SOME OF THE BEST TAXIDERMISTS IN BUSINESS AT THAT TIME
I THINK THAT THE INTENTION BEHIND THE COLLECTION WOULD BE TO SHOW AS MUCH OF THE DIVERSITY OF
AND I KNEW HIM WHEN I WAS A CHILD
WE KNOW IT'S REALLY RATHER AWFUL TO CHASE A FIRE ENGINE AND SEE WHAT WHAT WHAT YOU'LL FIND AT THE OTHER END
I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM WAS JUST HOW ENORMOUS HE WAS
THAT'S HOW HE HE BEGAN HIS WRITING CAREER
OR TELLING THEM STORIES AND THEN TRYING TO WRITE THEM DOWN
AND HIS CHILDREN NEVER WENT IN EITHER
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER HE WAS NORWEGIAN
HIS MOTHER WAS NORWEGIAN
AND I THINK HE KNEW
OR BY HORRIBLE GRANDPARENTS
THAT THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE ANOTHER ADULT IN THEIR LIVES WHO WAS
TO ENCOURAGE THE AMERICANS TO JOIN THE WAR
AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID
WELL I'M ABOUT TO FIND OUT
WE WANT A BIG ADVENTURE
CANDY LAST NIGHT WASN'T FEELING VERY GOOD ABOUT THE ACTUAL SHOW ANY MORE
ABOUT THE TASKS
YOU GOT TWO MINUTES IN WHICH TO DECIDE
NOT ONLY FOR EB PATIENTS
BUT ALSO FOR THEIR LOVED ONES
TAKE SKIN BIOPSY TO FIND OUT WHAT TYPE OF EB IT IS
AND WHEN THEY'RE DISCHARGED HOME
AND LET'S START DRAMATICALLY
I LOVE THAT FILM
UM HE PLAYS A FIGHTER PILOT WHO FALLS IN OVER A RADIO OPERATOR
THIS PLAY TRIED TO PACK FAR TOO MUCH INTO ONE HOUR
HARSH SENTENCES FROM OTHERS
DAYTIME HAS BEEN DELIVERING SOME TOP FLIGHT DRAMAS RECENTLY WITH LAND GIRLS AND MOVING ON
LET'S HAVE A PONDER ON THE WONDERFUL SPORTS COVERAGE OF YESTERYEAR
I KNOW THE BBC ARE DOING ALL THE COVERAGE
AND WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE MOST
BUT THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES
THE BBC DID DO A GOOD JOB OVERALL WITH THIS RECENT SPORTING RIGHTS ACQUISITION
BOTH ON BBC ONE AND ON THE RED BUTTON
IT WAS AN AMAZING SEASON
AND THE EASE WITH WHICH HE TALKS TO THE DRIVERS AND THE TAME PRINCIPALS REALLY HELPED
BBC ONE IS BRINGING US JO KSHAW IN THE IMPRESSIONS SHOW
ACCORDING TO THE LIST
BUT IT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO TICKLE THE ODD FUNNY BONE
NEVER MIND THE BUZZCOCKS USED TO BE HOSTED BY THE COMEDIAN SIMON AMSTELL
IT DOESN'T FOR OTHERS
HAPHAZARD BUT AT THE SAME TIME
BECAUSE SOMETHING PRETTY LOW KEY WHICH HASN'T BEEN WELL PUBLICISED AND DOESN'T MAYBE HAVE A CELEB
AND THAT ABOUT WRAPS THINGS UP FOR THIS WEEK
BUT WAS THE EMPEROR SHOT FOR THE VALUE OF HIS ANTLERS
AND JUST WHO ARE TROPHY HUNTERS
I'LL BE INVESTIGATING
PRETTY MUCH ALL MY LIFE
BUT SHOULD SHOOTING DEER EVER BE A SPORT
JUST A SLIGHT NOISE
JUST DEFINES THOSE AMAZING ANTLERS
AND I DID THAT REALLY TO PUT PEOPLE OFF THE SENTENCE TO WHERE HE WAS
NOT TOO MUCH HIDING
A FEW DAYS LATER
A FEW MILES FROM HERE
DEVON AND CORNWALL POLICE HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY COMPLAINTS
SO THEY AREN'T INVESTIGATING
THE PROBLEM IS THAT BULLETS ARE ACTUALLY CHEAPER THAN FENCES
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE
OFTEN FROM ABROAD
WILLING TO PAY GOOD MONEY TO BAG THEMSELVES A BRITISH STAG
AND I'M OFF TO BE ONE OF THE MEN THEY COME TO
IN EUROPE AND A LOT OF THE COUNTRIES THERE
THE DEER AREN'T MANAGED SO WELL
A LOT OF HUNTERS A LOT OF EUROPEAN HUNTERS
THEY JUST DON'T LET THEM MATURE
THE PICTURES I'VE SEEN
MAYBE READY TO BE TAKEN
IS A VILLAGE WITH
BY BUYING ONE OF THESE
ALL SOLD IN AID OF A GREAT CAUSE
YOU CAN ORDER THE CALENDAR IN THREE WAYS
THERES ONLY A FEW HUNDRED BREEDING COWS LEFT IN THE WORLD
SO I'M GOING TO LET THE RAM GO AS SOON AS ADAM GIVES ME A WAVE
AND IT WAS LIKE FIFTY OR SIXTY MILES LONG
THAT JB HAS LEFT A MARK ON THIS JB
JAMES HAS JOINED AN EXCLUSIVE DINING CLUB WHERE EVERYONE EATS FOR FREE
EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT BLACKBERRIES
BUT THE BEST THING IS
I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR FOUR CANDLES
NOT AS WELL AS I SHOULD BE BECAUSE THEY SPLIT THE SONGWRITING FOUR WAYS NOW
BUT HE DOES LITERALLY FLAT NOTHING
I THINK HE'S GONE
PROBABLY GONE OFF TO MAKE A BREW
HE'S GOT THE RIGHT IDEA THAT LAD
FORMER CASUAL LABOURER
DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT
BUT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE JOKES ABOUT FRIENDS OF DOROTHY OR WALKING LIKE A NANCY
AND BUT YOU KNOW ME
I NEED TWO HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS OF EPID
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES
I WANT FREE HOTDOGS AND POPCORN FOR ME AND ALL MY CREW
LET'S GO TO THE WEAKEST LINK STUDIO AND SEE IF THEY DID WHAT I SUGGESTED AND INSTALLED ANNE
SOME HARROWING FOOTAGE
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WOKE AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO FIND HALF A DOZEN MEN IN MASKS
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT
IT'S PRIME TIME
GIGGLING INAPPROPRIATELY WITH THEM
THIS WAS A SIMPLE ENOUGH TASK
THE NEXT MORNING
THE SAYING NO SNOW
IT'S NOT MUCH BLOODY USE TO US THERE
WHAT WILL LOW CLOUD COVER UNDER GRANDKIDS
UM THERE'S A GOOD LAD
I REALLY LOVE MY JOB
FROM THE FROZEN VERSION OF THE SWIMMING POOL
WE'VE GOT TOVAL AND DEAN
WE HAVE STRUGGLED FOR WEST BRIDGEFORD WITH ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY
BUT I HAVE GONE TO RUDDINGTON
WHICH IS THE NEXT VILLAGE TO WEST BRIDGEFORD
WE ARE GOING TO MAPILY
WHICH IS LOVELY
FROM THE SWIMMING POOL
WE ARE IN RUDDINGTON
IT'S A LITTLE BIT SMALL
RACHEL'S KICKING BACK WITH A NEGATIVE
THIS IS A NICE HOUSE
BUT SHE'S A BIT
WELL BUT SOMETIMES COUPLES LOVE TO PLAY GOOD COP
CHILDREN LOVE A BATH
IT IS A SMALL SWIMMING POOL
IT'S AN ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND
NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU DO EVERY EVENING
JUST GIVE THE MAN HIS DIGNITY AND LOOK AWAY
GUESS THE PRICE
I SAID MAXIMUM PRICE LAST TIME
LET'S GO AND LOOK AT THE BOX FACTORY
THEY'RE WORKING WITH THE THE BUILDING
IF WE GET IT FROM RACHEL
AND THE COMMUTE TO WORK
JUST DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT
YOU KNOW I'M QUITE PLEASED
I LIKE YOUR LOT
BUT THE WILD CAR
BUT I THINK THAT'S A VICTORY
IF YOU'RE OUT THERE AND YOU'RE STRUGGLING IN A SIMILAR WAY TO RACHEL AND NIGEL TO FIND THE PROPERTY
THEN PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE DON'T
HI FROM LAS VEGAS AND I THOUGHT
I LIKE THE SO THE SHAPE OF THAT
WELL I'M A PAINTER PRIMARILY LANDSCAPES
THEY'D NOT BE PLEASED IN THE AIRPORT IF YOU PITCHED UP WITH THIS ONE
THAT'S MY FAVOURITE
YOU'D HAVE SUCH AN ADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO LEARNING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
AND WHICH MEANS OVERALL YOU'RE MINUS TEN
WE ARE FACED WITH THE DOWNSIZING DILEMMA
SHE'S AN ADVANCED DRIVER SHE'S TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING I KNOW
IT COMES UP AND DOWN
ANNE SPOTTED THAT THAT WAS THE THING I WAS TALKING ABOUT
TRUE IF ONLY A SOUND EFFECT WOULD PLAY WITH THAT
SAILING IS ONE OF MY HOBBIES BUT
SO I'M GOING TO RESERVE JUDGMENT
WHICH WE ENJOYED
THERE'S CERTAIN FEATURES I DO LIKE
BUT I DON'T LIKE IT OVERALL AS MUCH AS THE OTHER ONE
LOVELY ART DECO DUPLEX APARTMENT
ANYTHING I PUT IN IT IS GOING TO BE MINE
SHALL WE DO THE
I'M NOT GOING TO ADMIT TO ANYTHING ON TV
I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE
I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE HOLE IN THE BUCKET
THE BIG QUESTION IS TODAY
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY
DID SHE SPEND THE LOT
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT JAMES' FRUIT BOWL LIGHT FITTING
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE STILL PLUS TWENTY
YOU GAVE CATHERINE SOUTHERN ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE POUNDS OF LEFTOVER LOLLY
OUR AMERICAN COUSIN
THIS IS BEDROOM TWO
SO YES THAT DOES LOOK LIKE A GREAT WINDOW
THE PRICE IS TWO FOUR NINE NINE FIFTY
IT'S A SECOND BEDROOM
HOW HAS THAT BEEN
THE IDEA OF THIS
WHAT DO WE THINK
BUT WE CAN TRY AND FIND YOU THE HOME OF YOUR DREAMS
AH WHICH MY MUM HELPED SET UP
FROM AH FROM A VERY EARLY AGE
I WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED IN IN DRUMMING AND
AND OF COURSE IF IT MAKES A HUGE PROFIT
BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT TO ACTUALLY GET WHICH WHICH I'M INTERESTED IN
BUT ALSO WE THINK WILL SELL
THE BATTERIES RAN DOWN QUICKLY AND QUITE FRANKLY
THE STATIC DECOY SET OUT IN THE FIELD WORKED ALMOST AS WELL
AND AS A RESULT
I THINK THE ESTIMATE WOULD BE THREE TO FIVE HUNDRED
AND ORIGINALLY WHEN IT WAS MADE
WHAT DID YOU FIND
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
NO DUST OR POLLUTION CAN GET AT THE SURFACE OF THAT PAINT BECAUSE THE SURFACE OF THE
THIS IS HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK
BUT IF YOU LIKE YOUR ONIONS WITH A BIT MORE FLAVOUR
THIS IS MY EVAPORATOR
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT FOR BREAKFAST AND GO OUT AND HAVE A GOOD DAY
GUM BASE IS ACTUALLY A MIXTURE OF INGREDIENTS
WHY DOESN'T IT DISAPPEAR WHEN YOU CHEW IT
FOOD MANUFACTURERS TRY REALLY HARD TO MAKE US LOVE THEIR PRODUCTS
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE CRUNCH
WHEN I WAS A KID
SEPARATE DINING ROOM
THAT YOU HAVE FURNITURE AND YOU BUILD A HOUSE AROUND THE FURNITURE
WALKING THE DOG
NOW MY PROPERTY IS A BEAUTY
WHAT PEOPLE LIKE ARE WILD CARDS
BUT WHAT PEOPLE LIKE ARE BARN CONVERSIONS
IT'S WHERE MIKE AND I RUN
THE CANAL IS A NICE RUN
I THINK WE'VE MAYBE EVEN HEARD UNSAID NEGATIVES
NOW WE'RE PLAYING WITH THE MAXIMUM BUDGET OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND
MIKE IS A HIGH FLYER
SO HE'S OFF ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING
IT'S THE ONLY WORKING FIRE IN THE HOUSE
THE ONE IN THE KITCHEN
IT'S A DINING KITCHEN
MIKE WILL NOT LIKE THOSE FARM BUILDINGS
WHAT SELL HOUSES
YOU DIDN'T REALLY BOTHER
BUT ACTUALLY LIKES LIVING THEM
I ALREADY KNEW THAT
BECAUSE I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF MEASURING MIKE SECRETLY LAST WEEK
THESE AREN'T MASSIVE BEDROOMS
I'VE GOT A QUESTION
BECAUSE WE'VE LEARNED SOMETHING FROM MIKE
AND MIKE DOESN'T LIKE FARM BUILDINGS
THIS IS A MOMENTOUS MOMENT
BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE US AT HOME TO HELP YOU IN YOUR PROPERTY SEARCH
OR YOU WERE RUNNING A BUSINESS
I THINK IT MIGHT DO THAT IN AUCTION
A MAXIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE
YOU WON'T FIND HANGING ON THE WALLS OF THIS HOUSE WORKS BY THE GREAT AND OLD
BECAUSE THE PATRONS
IF YOU'RE RECEIVING AN AWARD
BUT FOR THE REST OF US
MAIN QUESTION
AND I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
AND ABOUT THE FAITH THAT THEY BOTH SHARE
WHY DID I SAY I'D DO IT
THEY THINK IT WOULD HELP YOU YOU SEE HEAR THE SOUND OF FRIENDLY VOICES
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT
I'D LIKE IT SORT OF PINK AND YELLOW AND WHITE
WHICH IS WHY I ALWAYS SAY JESUS AND NOT THE LORD
WHICH RATHER WORRIES ME
OR MY CHARACTER
YOU CAN FOOL THE TOWN WITH TRAGEDY
IN A WAY THAT IS ALSO TO DO WITH LIFE
ONLY IN A DIFFERENT WAY
YOU WEREN'T UP YOURSELF
ASK IF YOU WANT SOMETHING
I'VE GOT TO GO HOME
THE TWO EXCEPTIONS
AND YET THEY DO GO ON BELIEVING
THAT IS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON
AND I THINK THOSE ARE
AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT THING
WHEN DOT HAD LOST HER FAITH
IN INVERTED COMMAS
IF YOU SEE A CHARACTER WITH A BIBLE THEY WOULD TEND TO BE ONE
BUT ALSO THE MOST BRILLIANT
BUT IF SHE DOES
BECAUSE HALF THE TIME WE DIDN'T MENTION IT
WHICH IS WHY I'M VERY PLEASED THAT I PLAY DOT
I THINK IT SHOULD BE
THAT IS WHY I SAY SO OFTEN
BECAUSE I HAD A VERY BAD BREAK UP TO HERE
A BRITISH AIRWAYS WORKER SAYS SHE'S PLANNING TO SUE HER EMPLOYER OVER HER RIGHT TO WEAR A CROSS
I'LL ALWAYS SAY IT NOW
SHE OPENED HER EYES AND SHE SAID
MOTHER'S COME BACK
AND THIS ONE AND THAT ONE
I'M SITTING HERE IN THE KITCHEN AND I'M TALKING TO YOU
WITH A BAKING SANDWICH AND A CUP OF TEA
I WAS A LITTLE BIT TIPSY
SO IT WAS KIND OF
AND THE REASON SHE DID
MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS
THESE TECHNICAL PEOPLE
AH BECAUSE THAT WILL JUSTIFY
I TELL YOU WHAT
REALLY LOVED IT
AND IT WAS GREAT WHEN SHE CAME BACK
IF YOU'RE NOT WORKING HARD
YOU'RE IN A JOB
SHE CAN MAKE YOU LAUGH
SHE'S SHE'S THE MORAL CENTRE OF THAT SHOW
I'M IN BLACKPOOL
AND SHE LEFT THE SHOW ON A SATURDAY NIGHT
SHE TRAVELLED BY BLACK CAB TO BLACKPOOL
SHE THEN GOT BACK IN THAT BLACK CAB
WHAT LONG SPEECH
THE CANOE LAKE OVER THERE HAS ROWING BOATS
AND A SMALL SECTION RESERVED FOR SAILING MODEL BOATS
ON SUNDAY MORNINGS
THE WHOLE LAKE IS RESERVED FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL MODEL YACHT CLUB AND IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THE CLUB STILL MEETS HERE TODAY
YOU'RE NOT JUST STEERING LEFT AND RIGHT
YOU HAVE TO USE THE WIND
THAT'S A FAIR OLD TIME
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS
TINY LITTLE BOYS
BUT I BET YOU IF WE GOT A BIT HIGHER
STAY ON YOUR OWN TWO FEET
I DON'T HAVE A STEAMER
THE FAMOUS COLOURED CLIFFS ARE SEEN AT THEIR BEST AFTER HEAVY RAIN
THE CLIFFS ARE BEST SEEN FROM THE DECK OF A STEAMER
IT WORKS ITS WAY RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH
YOU WEREN'T THERE
AND IF YOU'VE EVER SAT ON STUBBLE
AND THE OTHER THING WAS WAS THE SMELL
YOU COULD APPROACH IT DOWNWIND AND I WAS TOLD THAT BEFORE THE WIND GOT UP
A BIG FIELD WITH PEOPLE IN IT
WE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE MORE THAN THAT
KNOW AS SOON AS YOU GET ON THE BOAT FROM SOUTHAMPTON OR PORTSMOUTH AND
WE'VE BEEN CAMPED FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS NOW
SO I'M GOING TO RUN OFF THESE CLIFFS AND CATCH A RIDE ON THE FAMOUS ISLE OF WHITE WINDS
YOU GET TO BEHAVE LIKE A BULL IN A CHINA SHOP
THEN SHE CAN'T HAVE BEEN TRYING HARD ENOUGH
I THINK WHAT WE'LL WANT TO PROVE
IS WE ARE NOT THE STEREOTYPE
UM WE ARE ACTUALLY HARD WORKING
GRIT AND DETERMINATION ACTORS
I MIGHT GET DISTRACTED
INDEX GETS A BIT LAZY
I'D RATHER KEEP IT FLAT AS POSSIBLE
DON'T EMBARRASS ME
I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR PARADE HERE
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT DR HANNIBAL LECTOR IS IN FACT A PSYCHOPATHIC CANNIBAL SERIAL
I EVEN WANT TO MARRY YOU
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF BUSINESSES HERE
JASON AND HOWARD WRITE NOTHING
SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE LEAD VOCALS I DO AS WELL
UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN'T SHOW YOU THE STATIONERY WHOLESALERS BECAUSE SOMEONE BURNT IT
TWO MINUTES ON PSYCHIC SUGGESTION AND MIND CONTROL
YOUR TIME STARTS
PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT
SHE FELT ASSAULTED BY THE SMELL OF HUMAN SWEAT
DON'T WASH IT OFF
WITH GENEROUS BEQUESTS
I'M GOING TO HEAD OFF SOMEWHERE INCREDIBLY REFINED
HE WANTED IT TO STAY ALL TOGETHER
YOU'LL DECIDE LATER
HE WAS TRULY A POLYMATH OF THE APPLIED ARTS
HE DESIGNED TEXTILES
BELIEVE IT OR NOT
ANOTHER TEN POUND PROFIT
WHITE TV STUDIO
IN THE O FIVE SERIES
WEVE MADE GREAT STRIDES AS A TEAM
IT'S VERY INTERESTING WHEN YOU ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT SOMETHING IT'S IT'S TERRIBLY EXCITING WHEN YOU SEE THAT PASSION CATCH ON
YOU WANT HIM JUST TO GO OUT AND PLAY AND EXPRESS HIMSELF AND IMPOSE HIMSELF ON THE OPPOSITION
I'M IN MY MESS ROOM
PEOPLE COMING UP SAYING
READ THE STORY AT NIGHT
THE ULTIMATE TRIUMPH OF THE RATIONAL MIND
WHICH IS RATHER SURPRISING BECAUSE YOU AND I ARE ACTUALLY ON A GIANT ROCK
IT ALL STARTED WHEN A COUPLE OF THE AGE'S MORE UNUSUAL THINKERS CAME TO WORK AT THE COURT OF THE
WHICH FELL DOWN THE STAIRS WHEN DRUNK
WHICH WOULD TURN OUT TO BE ONE OF THE RAREST AND
PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN DRIVEN MAD BY LUNAR
ARE BORED WITH THESE WEARISOME CALCULATIONS
THE WHOLE MAD STRUCTURE OF THE GREEKS WOULD COME TUMBLING DOWN
MANY ASTRONOMERS COMPLAINED THAT HE HAD BROUGHT PHYSICS INTO ASTRONOMY
CHICKPEAS AND SLIPPERS FOR MY SON
THE BIBLE TEACHES US HOW TO GO TO HEAVEN
AND GALLO'S TRIAL
YOU REALIZE THAT THIS CLAIM
AND IN THAT MOMENT
BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW PLEASED HE WAS TO BE BACK
IN A MOMENT OF UNCHARACTERISTIC MODESTY
BUT HE'S QUITE A GOOD GUY
WE HAVE TWO EXPERTS
LET'S HOPE THEY'VE GOT THE STAMINA
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF COLLECTABLES
IT'S QUITE PRETTY
IS THE BARGAIN HUNT SPIRIT
IRRESPECTIVE OF HOW THEY DO
THE TEA AND COFFEE SERVICE
IT'S A HIGH RISK STRATEGY
AND IF YOU WANTED A PREDICTION
YOU HAVE MADE FIFTY POUNDS ON THAT
THERE'S SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM
JUST LIKE THE HOT STEAM IN YOUR BATHROOM CONDENSES ON YOUR COLD MIRROR
BUT IT JUST FEELS LIKE WALLPAPER PASTE
THEY'VE BEEN GROWN UNDER SOPHISTICATED LABORATORY CONDITIONS
AND WHEN IT'S USED AS AN INGREDIENT IT SORT OF FEELS LIKE FAT IN YOUR MOUTH AND THAT'S WHY FOOD
ALL THE SPACE THEY WANT INTERNALLY
IT'S FAIR TO SAY IT'S BEYOND THEIR WILDEST DREAMS
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO WALK INTO THIS PLACE
INTO A DETACHED PROPERTY
AND BE REALLY BLOWN AWAY BY IT YOU KNOW
HE WOULDN'T POSSIBLY LET THEM DOWN THE LAST MINUTE
READING BETWEEN THE LINES
BEFORE YOU GO FOR ME
HAVING LOVED PROPERTY ONE
THERE IS A BATHROOM WITH AN ACTUAL BATH IN IT
I WON'T TELL THEM
YOU WILL FIND OUT AS YOU LOOK ROUND THIS PLACE
TO GET A PERFECT PROPERTY
WITH ALL THE BITS AND PIECES YOU WANTED
WITHIN A LOCATION THAT YOU WANTED
ALTHOUGH I DO SUSPECT THAT THE LAST PROPERTY IN ASHOVER SOMEONE HAD A VERY GOOD
I MEAN THIS IS SO CHILD FRIENDLY AS WELL
AND THIS IS A FAMILY HOME
AND IF YOU THINK THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE YOU CAN BE HAPPY
IT'S JUST BASICALLY THINGS THAT I NO LONGER WANT OR NEED
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
AND THEY'RE FIVE YEARS OLD
AND WE CAN'T PICK THEM UP NOW
YOU RARELY GET A COLLECTION OF THESE AT AUCTION
THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT
THE OTHER THING IS
BECAUSE IN THIS ROOM
WELL BEFORE WE GET TOO FLUSHED
IT'S GOING TO MAKE
I REALLY HOPE SO
AND SO WE'VE WE'VE ESTIMATED AT FORTY TO SIXTY
AT LEAST FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT THE OLD FISH CASE
THAT'S BAD LUCK
I'M ALWAYS SURPRISED THAT PEOPLE AREN'T SCARED ENOUGH OF ME
I'M NOT NOT SAYING OTHERWISE
YOU COULD HEAR THE VOLCANO STARTING TO
I'M REALLY GLAD TO BE HERE
I DON'T THINK HE COULD HAVE BEEN DRUNK
IF YOU TRY AND SAY THIS
HE HAS A MUCH BETTER IMAGINATION THAN YOU HAVE
WHENEVER SHE CAME HOME
MAY I GO LIKE THAT
IT'S THAT LOVELY STORY
WHEN SHE WAS DROPPED OFF AT FOUR AND A HALF
AND DO YOU KNOW WHO JESUS IS
HE'S FOUR AND A HALF
OTHER PEOPLE MAY LET YOU DOWN
AND BUT JESUS WILL ALWAYS BE YOUR FRIEND
FOR YOUR FATHER
PLEASE DO SOMETHING
WHICH IS WHAT THEY THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE DONE
MY LIVER WAS FINE
NOW AT THAT TIME
I AM AN ALCOHOLIC
OTHER PEOPLE REFER TO GOOD
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM
BUT YOU DEAL WITH IT
WHICH IS ALL ABOUT GET CONTROL
I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT THAT I WAS SO MUCH THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE THAT IF I TURNED OVER THE WRONG
BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S TERRIFIED OF LETTING GO
I REMEMBER SAYING TO GOD
YOU LOOK AT MY LIFE IN THE LAST TWENTY THREE YEARS
AND AS WITH MOST OF THE PROGRAMS I WORKED ON
HAVE YOU GOT ANY GOOD IDEAS
WHATEVER MADE YOU THINK THAT GOD WOULD LOAD THE REVOLVER
THERE WAS A LOT OF TIME WHEN I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT GOD
SOME WAY DOWN THE LINE NOW
I KNOW YOU'RE VEGETARIAN
JUST ONE MORE CABBAGE
HOW SHE HADN'T NOTICED IT BEFORE
LADY VITA CIRCUMFERT
WE WERE COOKING TOGETHER
AND I THINK THEY THOUGHT WE'D FIGHT
BUT WHAT YOU SAW WAS WHAT YOU GOT
IT WAS US AGAINST THE REST YOU
THE GREAT THING ABOUT JENNIFER'S VOWELS WAS THAT YOU COULD HEAR THEM
TO WHICH I SAID YEAH
SOMETHING WHICH IS DESPERATELY NEEDED
WE ALL GET TOGETHER AND EVERYBODY COOKS SOMETHING
IF YOU HAD CLARISSA BESIDE YOU ON THE BARRICADES
AND THAT WAS A HUGE ACT OF FAITH
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
UM YOU THAT WAS THE OLD PAGAN HOLIDAY WHICH THE CHURCH ADOPTED
THIS IS YOUR BEST
WAS IT ALL WORTHWHILE
TO QUOTE MY MOTHER
LEAVE IT TO GOD
HE HAS A BETTER IMAGINATION THAN YOU HAVE
THE FOX THAT WILL PREDATE POULTRY
FARMERS WILL KEEP HAS ON THEIR ESTATE BECAUSE THEY LOVE THEIR COURSING OR BECAUSE THEY
AND I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT
LIKE BIG OPEN SPACES
BUT MAINLY BARNS
BUT IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE ERA OF STONE BUILT BARNS
IT'S GENERALLY AGAINST PLANNING REGULATIONS TO CONVERT THEM
HERE IN THE DALES
IN AN AREA WHERE AFFORDABLE RURAL HOUSING FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO LIVE AND WORK HERE IS A SERIOUS
AND THIS IS OUR TEST BUILD POD
WHERE THE GUY WAS BURIED
WITH BREATHING APPARATUS ON
AH KNOWING THAT THAT INDUSTRY COULD BE REVIVED
FIVE MILLION POUNDS OF PRIZE MONEY
THIS DRAMATIC BACKDROP HERE HAS BEEN THE INSPIRATION FOR COUNTLESS WORKS OF ART AND LITERATURE
FROM CHARLES KINGSLEY TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH
BUT THE REAL STARS OF THE SHOW ARE A PAIR OF BREEDING PEREGRINE FALCONS HIDING SOMEWHERE IN THE
I'M HOPING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THEM A LITTLE LATER THROUGH DAVE'S TELESCOPE
IF HE'S HAD ANY LUCK FINDING THEM
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY STARS OF THIS LANDSCAPE
AS PART OF THE YORKSHIRE DALES
THIS AREA HAS INSPIRED LANDSCAPE ARTISTS OVER THE YEARS
NO ITALIAN SUNBEAM COULD OUTSHINE
THE MEMORY OF THE PLEASANT DALES
WE RUN A SCHOOL HERE FOUR OR FIVE TIMES A YEAR AND
WHICH WE'LL COME TO FAILURE ON IN THE IN THE TRACK AND
SO WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL THROUGH THERE
JOIN ME SHORTLY WHEN I BURN RUBBER AROUND THE COURSE
THE BAD NEWS IS
OVER AN HOUR FROM NOW
THEY'RE GOING TO BE DREAMING OF THAT WATER
BUT I'M NOT REALLY HERE
JUST LIKE WITH THE DVD
WE KNOW THAT POINTS OF VIEW VIEWERS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THE FUTURE OF TELEVISION
THE BBC NEWS SITE GETS TEN MILLION USERS PER WEEK
WITH A QUARTER OF A MILLION USERS PER WEEK
YOU COULD JOIN UP
IT'S MORE LIKELY THEY'RE PLAYING GAMES ON THE CBBC PROGRAMME PAGES
CONRAD THE CATERPILLAR
OR A QUESTION OF SPORT
QUESTION OF SPORT WILL BE ABLE TO BE SEEN TWICE A WEEK MONDAY AT TEN
BUT THEN REPEATED IN ITS TRADITIONAL SLOT
THAT'S WHAT I CALL A RESULT
THE BBC HAS MADE RADIO AND TV PROGRAMS TO MARK THE FIFTIETH YEAR SINCE INDEPENDENCE
SWEET GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US
AND IT'S OUR JOB TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING SOME EXPOSURE OF ROCK
THAT'S THE KEY TO IT
IF SOMEONE'S BEEN TRYING TO SELL YOU A BARGAIN BIRD
OR IT'S SAFE TO EAT
AND A LOT OF POULTRY FARMERS ARE QUITE SMALL OPERATION SO
BUT THERE'S MANY BIRDS HERE
WE DON'T LIKE LOUD NOISES IN AMONGST THE BIRDS
WE'VE GOT A SILENT SYSTEM
BUT MANY TURKEY THEFTS HAPPEN MUCH CLOSER TO THE BIG DAY
WHEN THE BIRDS ARE FULLY GROWN
WITHOUT THOSE LEVELS OF INSPECTION
A YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THOSE BIRDS HAD BEEN ON MEDICATED FEED AND
UM THERE ARE RISKS
IT'S THE ORANGE CARROT
WHICH IS ONE OF THE FIRST EXAMPLES OF A VEGETABLE BEING SPECIFICALLY BRED TO CHANGE ITS COLOUR AND
THOUSAND POUNDS AND WE'RE WELL ON THE WAY TO A RECORD BREAKING TOTAL
AND THERE'S STILL TIME TO BUY ONE
WE MADE SOME BIG BILLS AS WELL
WE'LL BE IN DEVON ON THE EX ESTUARY TO FIND OUT WHY IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT STOPOVER FOR SOME OF
ANYTHING YOU CAN REMEMBER COULD BE OF HELP
HE SAID HE'D BEEN GONE FIVE MINUTES
IF YOU HAVE A GENUINE AILMENT
YOU KNOW THE RULES
HE'S JUST THE RECEPTIONIST
SOMEONE'S WINDING YOU UP
I CAN NOW SEE THAT THAT WAS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOUR FOR A BUCKINGHAM PALACE GARDEN
YOUR HAIR IS AS LOVELY AS MY BOTTOM IS LARGE
I'M SENSING A THEME HERE
YOU'RE ALWAYS RIGHT
I'M TAKING THESE CHIPS BACK
TWO THINGS WITH GAS ARE IN THE FRONT
KING OF THE GODS
BUT THANKFULLY ZEUS WAS ON HAND TO AVERT DISASTER
AND HURLED THEM BOTH INTO THE SKY
GIVING US THE CONSTELLATION OF URSA MAJOR
WHENEVER YOU SEE AN ARRANGEMENT OF STARS LIKE THIS
AND I CAN SHOW YOU WHY IF WE HEAD INTO SPACE
WAY BEYOND THE BORDERS OF URSA MAJOR
TRAVELLING THROUGH THE MILKY WAY TOGETHER
IF THAT WAS FACING THE EARTH
YOU WON'T GET MUCH FURTHER THAN SEEING THEM AS FAINT FUZZY PATCHES
IT'S NOT REALLY
IT'S ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THE FULL MOON AGAIN
WE LOOKED OUT INTO THE FAR REACHES THE BE
AND TALKING ABOUT VOLCANOES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM
DON'T LET A SMALL THING LIKE A MAN TYING YOU TO A TRAIN TRACK HOLD YOU BACK FROM DOING WHAT YOU DO
PROBABLY NOT EVEN ENOUGH FOR A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE
NOW I'VE INSIDE KATHY'S MIND
I WILL BE VERY INTRIGUED
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD NEED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE
SHE SHOULDN'T BE SAYING THAT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR US
IT SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE
LITTLE BIT MORE IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO DO YOU KNOW
HOPE TODAY IT'S GOING TO BE FOR RICHER
YVONNE AND BRIAN
NOW YOU TAKING THE CELL
THE CRYING ONES
OF HIS FIFTY FOUR PICTURES
MODE THE ARTIST THAT CREATED THOSE TREMENDOUS SERIES OF PICTURES
THEY ARE WOMEN AFTER ALAN TITCHMARSH'S HEART
DO YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT'S PERIOD
NOW PROPERTY NUMBER ONE IN THE PROPERTY GAME IS A FORMER ANIMAL STORAGE UNIT
MOST PEOPLE LOVE THE WILD CARD
THE COWS DID NOT WARM THEMSELVES BY A FIREPLACE
KNOWING THE PRICE
WHAT DO YOU THINK
BY HAVING A SERVING HATCH
I THINK THAT'S WHAT AL GORE WAS TALKING ABOUT
THIS HOUSE HAS GONE INCREDIBLYABLY WELL
FOR ALL OF YOU AT HOME
WE GET SAMPLES FROM TANKERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD AND WE TAKE THE SAMPLES AND WE HAVE TO DO
WITH WIZARDS AND DRAGONS
WHICH ARE ABOUT THIS BIG
WHICH IS LOVELY
IT'S JUST AS IT WAS MADE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH A PRETTY YOUNG GIRL WITH DOGS
PLAY A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT
WE'LL FIND OUT AT THE AUCTION
MONEY NOT SPENT ON THE SHOPPING
IS A MOST EFFECTIVE LIGHT JOB HERE
WHICH IS BY AN ARTIST CALLED LUCA GIORDANO
THEY'RE OLD FASHIONED AND OUT OF DATE AND EFFECTIVELY
OUR TEAMS WERE GIVEN THREE HUNDRED POUNDS TO SPEND
NOW FOR THE BLUES
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK
I MEAN THIS IS FANTASTIC QUALITY
WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTEST
COMMAND WAITING FOR YOU
YOU ARE PLUS FORTY FIVE
SO I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO BASICS
I'M NOT SURE IF IT WOULD PASS FOR MASH
WHICH IS ABOUT THE SAME AS FIFTY CUPS OF COFFEE
OR IN THIS CASE FILLED WITH CAFFEINE
TO GET AS MUCH CAFFEINE OUT OF THE BEANS
I HAVE TO CLEAN THE CAFFEINE OUT OF THE WATER
SPACE TO GROW THINGS
GO ROUND THE GARDEN
TRY IT ON CEREAL
THAT'S A GOOD START
IF ALL DOESN'T GO QUITE ACCORDING TO PLAN
WELL THEY'RE GETTING VERY SCARCE TO FIND NOW
IF YOU WERE A LONG TERM DIPLOMAT
THE COUNTRY WOULD AWARD YOU A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SILVER
WILLIAM WAS AWARDED OVER FIVE THOUSAND
WHICH WOULD HAVE SAT IN FRONT OF THE AMBASSADOR DURING HIS FORMAL DINNERS
AND THEN DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT THEM HARD OR SOFT
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT
I THINK THEY'RE IN TROUBLE
ON THE FACE OF THAT
WHY WOULD THAT BE
THIS STUFF IS MADE ON THE SPOT INSIDE A MACHINE
USUALLY OUT OF A LIQUID READY MIX OR POWDER THAT THE ICE CREAM MAN ADDS WATER TO
THEY WOULD CHILL ALL THIS DOWN WITH AN ELECTRIC FREEZER
BUT THERE ARE SOME VEGETABLES THAT NEED THE BIG CHILL AND A RACE AGAINST THE CLOCK
SO IT'S NO SURPRISE FOOD FACTORIES HAVE HIT ON A WAY TO MAKE THESE MUCH
THEY HAVE A MACHINE CALLED AN EXTRUDER THAT APPLIES A CONTINUOUS PRESSURE AND GRINDS UP ALL THE
I WOULDN'T GIVE THESE AWAY FOR FREE
MAYBE NEVER EVEN SEEN BEFORE
MAYBE JUST TWENTY YEARS AGO
YOU ONLY GET FROM THE DIARIES
WHERE HAS A CENTURY'S PROGRESSION LEFT THEM
YOU WILL FIND THAT PEOPLE
THEY ARE VERY CONSCIOUS THAT IF THEY DON'T MAKE THE RENT
THEN THE ABYSS OPENS UP UNDERNEATH THEM
THERE IS TECHNICALLY A SAFETY NET
THERE IS THE WORKHOUSE
BUT THE TERROR THAT THE WORKHOUSE HELD FOR ORDINARY WORKING PEOPLE MEANS THAT THEY WOULD
GET THE THINGS THAT I NEED
YOU CAN'T HAVE A DECENT LIFE ON BENEFITS
IT IS HAND TO MOUTH EXISTENCE
IN THE LONG TERM
IT IS TOO DIFFICULT
PAY YOUR RENT OR YOUR MORTGAGE
THAT WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF HER ECONOMIC SITUATION
IS VERY MUCH ALIVE AND WELL
PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG PARENTS
YOU KNOW THEY REALLY DO FEEL VERY KEENLY THAT THAT THAT PUBLIC DISDAIN FOR
PARTICULARLY YOUNG SINGLE PARENTS
WE WENT OUT TOGETHER
IN HANDING IN MY CARD
THEN JUST HOW YOU QUALIFY FOR BENEFITS BECOMES A KEY QUESTION
EVEN IN HOW MUCH MONEY THEY GET
NOT NOT NOT GOOD WINS REALLY
AH PLUS THEY KNEW HOW MUCH I LOVE TIGERS AND EVERYTHING
I PULLED THE ONE SHOE OFF
THE THERAPEUTIC ASPECTS
GOT TO MAKE A LIVING
BUT THEY HAVEN'T SPENT ALL THE CASH
THE BIG QUESTION IS
HE WAS A KEY FIGURE IN THE FORMATION OF BRITISH INDIA AND
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CLIVE MUSEUM
THE BIG QUESTION IS TODAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IT HAS TO BE SAID
AND YOU'LL DECIDE LATER
WE'VE COME WITH THE SUPPLY
AND HERE WE ARE WITH PHILIP ALWOOD AT BO
SO LONG AS IT'S IN THE RIGHT LOCATION
IF IT NEEDS A BIT MORE WORK
AFFECT PERFECT LOCATION
ROMANTIC POET ANNA SEWARD
ALL LIVING IN THIS CITY DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
THIS PLACE IS GIFT WRAP FOR KATY
I THINK IT'S GREAT
SO YOU'RE GO TO GO FIRST
WE THOUGHT WE'D GIVE THEM MORE OF A MILD CARD THAN A WILD CARD
LOVELY BIG WINDOW
IT IS A BIT OF A SMALL KITCHEN
SHALL WE FIND OUT
AND WE JUST NEED TO LOOK INTO IT A LITTLE BIT MORE
LET'S GO BUGIN HUNTING
WHERE WE HAVE A MULTITUDE
I DO LIKE TO BUY WHEN I GO TO EXHIBITIONS
I APPRECIATE PEOPLE BUYING OF MY WORK
THEN I STAYED THERE FOR THREE YEARS
CAME HOME AND STARTED TEACHING PRIVATELY AND
IT DOES SAY IT'S GOT RESTORATION ON THE BASE
THEY COULD BE REALLY OLD
THEY COULD BE AT LEAST FORTY
AS WE AGE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE BODY CONK OUT
IT'S THE PULSE OF THE CHURCH
WIND BLOWING EIGHTY
ANGLO SAXON ENGLAND WAS DEAD
THE NEW NORMAN ABBOT OF ABINGDON
ANGLO SAXON REBELS SET UP SECRET AMBUSHES FOR THE NORMANS AND KILLED THEM IN WOODS
THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES HAD TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS ENGLISH
IN WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR'S ENGLAND
THEY SACKED EVERY VILLAGE AND FARMSTEAD AS THEY WENT
THEN WILLIAM DIVIDED HIS TROOPS INTO SMALLER BANDS WHO DESTROYED ANY CROPS AND LIVESTOCK THEY COULD
THESE PEOPLE LAY THROUGHOUT THE VILLAGE
AND ON THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF HIS CORONATION
HE WORE HIS CROWN AND ROBES IN THE RUINS OF YORK MINSTER
A RULING ELITE OF PERHAPS NO MORE THAN TEN
INTERMARRIAGE WAS COMMON
AND THE CHILDREN OF THESE ANGLO NORMAN MARRIAGES SPOKE ENGLISH
THE NORMAN NAMES WILLIAM
ROBERT CAUGHT ON AMONGST THE CONQUERED
AND ENDURE TO THIS DAY
COVERED IN DUNG
IT'S NAMED IN ENGLISH
WHEN IT'S BEEN COOKED AND CARVED AND PUT ON THE TABLE WITH A GLASS OF WINE
THE LANGUAGE OF POWER OF THE NORMANS
ONLY THE DAY BEFORE
EAGER FOR THE LOOT THEY HOPED TO OBTAIN
SHE RANTED AT THE ISLE AND ALL WHO DWELT THERE
SHE THREATENED DESTRUCTION AND DEFEAT
BUT UNDER THEIR WEIGHT
WHOSE HOMES AND FIELDS AND
HAD ANOTHER NAME FOR IT DOOSDAY
PERCENT THE VAST MAJORITY
WAS NOW IN THE HANDS OF NORMAN BARONS
HE WAS CARRIED BACK TO A QUIET PRIORY IN NORMANDY TO RECOVER
STUDIED THE BIBLE AND DID GOOD WORKS FOR THE POOR
SHE AND HER CHILDREN WOULD INITIATE A TRANSFORMATION OF SCOTLAND THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE LIKE
SHE INSISTED ON A NEW LEVEL OF CEREMONY IN THE SCOTTISH ROYAL COURT
ITS OWN CURRENCY
THE NORMANS FACED MANY COMPETING PRINCES AND INDEPENDENT PRINCIPALITIES
THE NORMANS TOOK WALES PIECE BY PIECE
THEY WERE THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY
WITH THEIR OWN LAW COURTS
ONE UNFORTUNATE MESSENGER WHO TURNED UP IN THE MARCH WITH A ROYAL WRIT
WAS FORCED TO EAT IT
LIKE THEIR FATHER
HE CAME TO IRELAND ATTRACTED BY DERMOT'S OFFER OF RICHES
ONE HUNDRED NORMANS VERSUS THREE
BUT RAYMOND CUNNINGLY DROVE A HERD OF CATTLE INTO THE IRISH RANKS
HE SUCCEEDED DERMOT AS RULER OF LEINSTER
BUT WEXFORD AND DUBLIN WERE IN HIS HANDS
ONE OF THE GREAT SYMBOLS OF SAVAGERY
RAWNESS AND RELIGIOUS IGNORANCE
SCOTLAND FOUND A WAY TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE NORMANS
WITH ITS OWN LAW
S YOU KNOW THE FIRST TIME YOU MEET THE HORSE
THEN PUTTING HER BACK INTO WORK FOR A WEEK OR SO
AND THAT MAY HAVE BEEN FROM INFECTED WILDLIFE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN FROM INFECTED LIVESTOCK FROM
YEAH AGAIN WE WOULD WE WOULD BE REALLY UPSET
SO THAT MEANS THAT
ON EACH HIGH TIDE
I'M HERE TO HITCH A LIFT WITH ONE OF THEM THAT'S JUST COMING IN WITH TODAY'S CATCH
BUT IN TERMS OF HIS LONG TERM FUNCTION
THE BACK OF THEM
PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE OF KANSAS
AND IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE TURNED AS A STRONG TORNADO
AND IT CAN BE ENOUGH
WE COULD GET ONE NEXT WEEK
BECAUSE IF IT RAINS
THEY CAN MAKE YOU FAINT
BRING ON A STROKE OR A HEART ATTACK
AND IN THE MEANTIME
IS WELL TO THE NORTH OF US OR TO THE SOUTH
WHY ARE WE STILL GOING THAT WAY
MADE RUBBISH DECISIONS
GREECE AND TURKEY
HOW WILL WE STEER OUR TITANIC RAFTS
I HAVE LESS HAIR
I WOULD SAY THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST TRYING TIME IN MY LIFE
CHILDREN NEED BOUNDARIES BUT ONCE DISCIPLINE BREAKS DOWN
IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THINGS BACK ON TRACK
AND IN SOME CASES
BE BETTER PARENTS THAN THEIR PARENTS WERE
BUT IT'S A COURSE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE EMPOWERED TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN LIVES
THERE IS A CHARITY THAT CAN HELP
FAMILY LINKS PROVIDES A TEN WEEK COURSE THAT SUPPORTS CHILDREN AND PARENTS AND HELPS TO GIVE THEM
IT'S HELPED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES PUT THE FUN BACK INTO FAMILY LIFE
FIND OUT WHAT WAS THE BEST CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH TO GROW VEG
WHAT VARIETIES WOULD WORK BEST
WHAT TYPE OF FERTILISER WOULD WORK BEST
READY FROZEN V STRAIGHT FROM THE GROUND
WHICH HAS BEEN A HARD AND LONG PROCESS
BUT BEFORE I HEAD OUT THERE
HERE'S A REMINDER OF THIS WINTER WARMER THE FABULOUS COUNTRYFILE CALENDAR
AROUND THESE PARTS OF BUCKINGHAMSHIRE
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER WILL
ONE DAY I WAKE UP AND I FEEL LIKE A TEPE
THE NEXT DAY I WAKE UP AND I FEEL LIKE A BIG TOP
A PROBLEM IF PAUL HAS NOT BEEN UPFRONT ABOUT HOW MUCH HE FANCIES DOING DIY
THEY HAVE NO FURNITURE
YEAH REALLY NICE AND MODERN AND SPACIOUS
IT'S NO LAUGHING MATTER
NOT THAT POSITIVE
SO BECAUSE THEY'RE TWENTY ONE
IT'S BEEN DONE WELL
YOU COULD PUT DOUBLE BEDS IN ALL OF THEM
PAUL IS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD AND WHAT HE'S ACTUALLY SAYING
IF YOU ARE A MOTHER
FOR GOODNESS SAKE
BECAUSE I WORK IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY I'M SO QUITE PRIVILEGED IN GETTING BACKSTAGE ACCESS
OR A COLLECTOR
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
GOOD LUCK WITH IT
NOT SURPRISINGLY DOMINATED BY AN ENORMOUS
THE FELT IS DYED GREEN
THEN I THOUGHT IT WAS SO LIFE LIKE
FOR A LONG TIME
YOU ARE THE IDEAL AGENT FOR THIS OPERATION
HOW CAN I PUT IT
HOW CAN I PUT IT
THE MORE WE ARE IN DANGER
I THINK SHE LIKES YOU
I HAVE BEEN APPOINTED A
THEY ARE GERMANS BUT
MY HUSBAND AND I
I EXPECT THE HEADLINE TO READ SOMETHING LIKE
I KNOW ABOUT DEAD
WE'LL BE THERE IN NO TIME
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING
NOW LISTEN TO ME
IT'S NOT UPSTAIRS
TRYING TO LOOK LIKE A PASSENGER
HAD WE NOT BEEN CHASING STOWAWAYS
HE GETS AWAY WITH IT
YOU SEE WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
FORGET ALL THIS EVER HAPPENED
NOT THAT I'LL TELL ANYONE ABOUT
FIVE MILES DOWN THE ROAD BUT
DON'T YOU OLIVE ME
A FEW BUMPS AND BRUISES
I'VE TALKED TO HER ABOUT IT
I THINK SHE'S COMING AROUND TO THE IDEA
CALL ME ANYTIME
ABOUT THE SHARKS
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
ARE WE GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT LATER AT AUCTION
WHICH IS YOUR FAVOURITE PIECE
ALONG WITH A BARONETCY BY NO LESS A PERSONAGE THAN KING GEORGE
THE BIG QUESTION IS TODAY
BUT THIS HOUSE HAS BEEN OURS IN OUR FAMILY FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS
IT WAS PRESENTED BY GEORGE THE THIRD TO MY GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT UNCLE
BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO YOU INHERIT THIS
YOU CAN GET LITTLE WORMS AND THINGS THAT COME OFF OUR CLOTHES
ALL THE BOOKS NEED TO BE AIRED
MY SISTER IS NOW A BOOK RESTORER
SO THEY'RE IN WITH A SHOUT THERE
I DON'T LIKE THEM
I'M VERY WELL INDEED
WHICH TAKES YOUR PROFIT TO PLUS FIVE
THAT IS MINUS FORTY
YOU ARE MINUS THIRTY FIVE
APART FROM THAT
EVERYTHING IS FINE
I JUST WANTED FIVE
I'D LIKE TO SIT DOWN
AS A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY PRESENT TO YOU
I FIGURED IT OUT
BUT I DO HAVE A GOOD LAUGH
ALONG WITH UGANDAN MORRIS
YOU JUST HAVE A NICE TIME
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
FIRST PRIZE IS ONLY A STEREO SYSTEM WORTH ONE
I'M GOING TO MAKE MY OWN
BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM AN OLD RECORD PLAYER
THAT IS READY TO BE MADE INTO A CHOCOLATE BAR BUT I RECKON I NEED SOMETHING A BIT MORE CLASSY
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT CHOCOLATE
IN TURNING THE EGGS
OR YOU JUST FANCY HAVING A GO
I DON'T NEED VINEGAR
THEN DON'T TOUCH IT WITH YOUR FINGERS
WHICH IS A VERY DIFFERENT BEAST TO MARZIPAN
ALMONDS AND ICING SUGAR
THAT'S WHERE WE BEGIN TO GET MORE DISTINCT PUDDINGS AND PUDDING FORMS
WE ARE BACK ON TRACK
UM BUT LISTEN WE HAVEN'T FINISHED YET
THIS PLACE HAS JUST GOT BETTER AND BETTER
YOU ARE CLOSEST
BUT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE REAL REQUIREMENTS
WHATEVER YOUR REQUIREMENTS
DAMIEN'S DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE BABYIT
IF SHE COULD BE IN A JAMES BOND FILM
IF HE CALL IN AGAIN
HOW TO AVOID EXPENSIVE PUBS
DOUBLE OR QUITS
I HEARD RODNEY AND HIS MA MICKEY PEARCE TALKING TONIGHT
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DREAM
LOCAL COMPANY SEEKS AMBITIOUS
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THE TROTTER BROTHERS
GIVE HER YOUR LOVE
I'M GOING BE IN CHARGE OF PURCHASING
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS VASECTOMY IDEA
WHEN YOU HAVE THE OPERATION
THEY GOTTA GO SOMEWHERE
THEY'RE A PEACEFUL
I DON'T WANT NO SOBBING
WE GET THIS FUSION TO HAPPEN
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO POWER OUR CIVILIZATION
GOING ON THE BIKE
WE MUST WRITE A STERN LETTER OF COMPLAINT IN THE STRONGEST TERMS ABOUT THIS INFERNAL PRODUCT
BUT NOT TO WORRY
JUST BECAUSE WE DIDN'T VOTE FOR ANY OF THEM
WHY SHOULDN'T THEY TELL US WHAT TO DO WHENEVER THEY LIKE
IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE
BUT LUCKILY FOR JEREMY
TO WHICH I FEEL COMPELLED TO LEND MY SULTRY VOICE
WHENEVER I'M WORKING WITH POISON IVY
COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK
OBVIOUSLY I WOULDN'T
YOU'RE THE COMPUTER
I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO BE LOOKING AT HIGH SPEED RAIL
IT'S ONE FOR MY PARTNER
AND THEY'RE IN CAPS
ROBERT HAD A HEART FULL OF PASSION AND ANGER
HE WAS POOR IN THE THINGS NECESSARY FOR LIFE
INDEED HE LACKED EVERYTHING
AS THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SURVIVED IN THE DESERT
SO ROBERT LIVED ON HIS HILLTOP
POPE LEO WAS ANGERED BY THE NORMANS' PLUNDERING
TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND RETURN TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY
THEY WANTED HIS FORGIVENESS
BUT ONCE THEY'D BEEN PARDONED
THE NORMANS HELD POPE LEO HOSTAGE FOR NINE MONTHS
HE KNEW THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE WAITING FOR NEWS IN PALERMO
OR IN BATTLE WITH THE PAGANS
WILL EARN IMMEDIATE REMISSION OF SINS
AND FOR THOSE WHO DIED ON THE EXPEDITION
DURING ONE FIERCE BATTLE
AND SINCE BOMAN'S ASSAULT ON THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE TOOK PLACE ONLY FIFTEEN YEARS LATER
BUT THIS WAS OUTWEIGHED BY HIS TERRIFYING QUALITIES
HIS WHOLE BEING WAS HARSH AND BRUTAL
EVEN HIS LAUGH SOUNDED LIKE A SNORT OF RAGE
THEY ALL HAD TO PROMISE TO RETURN TO HIS EMPIRE ANY FORMER BYZANTINE TOWNS THEY MANAGED TO LIBERATE
SOME OF THE CRUSADERS
INCLUDING SEVERAL OF THE LEADERS
GO WITH CONFIDENCE AND CLIMB THE LADDER INTO ANTIOCH
WHICH WE WILL QUICKLY HAVE IN OUR POSSESSION
IF IT PLEASES GOD
IF BOHEMOND CAN GAIN POSSESSION OF THE CITY
BOUND HAD OUTWITTED THE OTHER CRUSADERS
HE RAISED HIS STANDARD ALONGSIDE THE CITADEL AND TOOK CONTROL OF THE CITY
HE SET HIMSELF UP AS AN INDEPENDENT CHRISTIAN PRINCE
BOHEMOND ESTABLISHED A NEW NORMAN STATE
IT'S THE SITE OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION
THE HOLY SEPULCHRE
ONE NORMAN KNIGHT RECORDS HOW THE CRUSADERS HAD TO SEW UP THE SKINS OF OXEN AND BUFFALO AND CARRY
WE DRANK THE STINKING WATER FROM THESE CONTAINERS
USING BATTERING RAMS AND SIEGE TOWERS
FOR TWO DAYS THE CONFLICT HUNG IN THE BALANCE
THEN THE CRUSADERS BROKE INTO THE CITY
TANCRED WAS AMONGST THE LEADERS
I SAID YOUR NAME WAS DEREK
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
SAY THAT WAS LIFE'S LUCKY DIP
ONE SILVER FOB WATCH ENGRAVED HARRISON
PEOPLE BECOME FAMOUS
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND
HE'S GOT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ELECTRONIC CARPET STEAMERS
AS WE GATHER ON THIS CHRISTMAS MORNING
WITH THE SHEPHERDS
THEY SHALL NEVER BE SILENT
AND GIVE HIM NO REST UNTIL HE ESTABLISHES JERUSALEM
AND FOREIGNERS SHALL NOT DRINK THE WINE FOR WHICH YOU HAVE LABOURED
GO THROUGH THE GATES
GOD LOVES EVERYONE
SON AND HOLY SPIRIT
WHO TOOK OUR HUMAN NATURE
DIED FOR US AND ROSE AGAIN
BROKEN OR LEFT UNUSED
ACCEPTANCE AND GRACE
WHEN THEY SAW THIS
MAYBE YOU TREASURE THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU THIS DAY
WHO WAS SENT BY YOU IN YOUR GREAT GOODNESS TO BE OUR SAVIOUR
BORN OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN
EAST AND WEST TO SIT AT YOUR TABLE
LET US ADORE HIM
AND WITH ALL THE COMPANY OF HEAVEN
AND ACCORDING TO YOUR HOLY WILL
IN THE UNITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
ALL HONOUR AND GLORY BE YOURS
WHICH IS WHY I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME REALLY TASTY IDEAS FOR WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THOSE DELICIOUS
HERE'S A TASTE OF WHAT'S TO COME
LIKE MANY OF US
IS DETERMINED TO DO HIS BIT FOR CONSERVATION
IT WOULDN'T BE INDISCRIMINATE
SUDDENLY THE WATER COMES RIGHT UP TO THE TOP OF THE KNOTS' LEGS AND THEY TAKE FLIGHT
BY THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
OCCASIONALLY WE GET A REAL TREAT WHEN A RARE BIRD GRACES OUR SHORES
WE'D LOST ALL OUR CRANES AS WELL
WITH HUNTING AND HABITAT LOSS ALL TAKING ITS TOLL
BUT BEFORE THAT
NEXT WEEK WE' WILL BE HEADING TO THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER TO BASK IN THE BEAUTY OF THE BRITISH
MY HUSBAND INHERITED THE HOUSE WHEN WE WERE ABROAD
WITH A PROFESSED COOK YOU'LL BE WANTING A KITCHEN MAID AS WELL
BUT THEY'D BE VERY JUVENILE
IT'S QUEEN MARY I'M ON THE RACK ABOUT
WE'LL END UP DEAD IN HARNESS
I WAS BROUGHT UP TO BE POLITE TO STRANGERS
MUCH DISCUSSED IN WASHINGTON
I KNOW I GAVE YOU CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT STAFF
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE
THEY WERE SO OLD AND SHABBY
LADY YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T ACCEPT SECOND BEST
WERE YOU EVER IN THE ACTUAL NAVY
I SHALL PUT OFF THE HOPE GIRLS
I'M HERE TO ORGANISE STAFF
AND SIR AND MA'AM
TO RHYME WITH HAM
FOUR MORE FAMOUS FACES ARE ABOUT TO PUT THEMSELVES THROUGH THE BLACK CHAIR ORDEAL
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR CHOSEN CHARITY
THE USUAL RULES APPLY TWO MINUTES OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND TWO MINUTES ON
BECAUSE CHARLIE CHAPLIN HAD IT FIRST
BUT I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A WAY OF BREAKING THE NEWS WHICH MAKES PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTED
YOU'VE GOT PERFECT TASTE BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING
DO JOIN US AGAIN
VERY FEW ARE MADE
I DIDN'T LIKE TO DISTURB YOU
AS ORDERED BY LADY HOLLAND
WHEN HE WAS POINTED OUT
IT WILL BE YOU TOMORROW
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING THEATRICAL IN THAT
I HAVE A MEETING WITH HALI SELASSIE
AND YOU HAVE TO DRIVE INTO WATERLOO STATION
I' BEEN DESPATCHED IN MY PRIVATE CAPACITY
STRAINING TO KEEP PACE BECAUSE MY ROLE AS YOUR WIFE REQUIRED IT
FOUR MORE FAMOUS FACES WILL BATTLE IT OUT TONIGHT
EACH OF OUR CONTENDERS WILL BE PITTING THEIR SPECIALIST EXPERTISE AND GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AGAINST THE
AT THE END OF TWO ROUNDS
ALL THEIR FEES ARE GOING TO A CHARITY OF THEIR CHOICE
I NEVER REALLY MANAGED THE POLE VAULT
AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT BREAKING NEWS
I JUST WROTE IN THE PAPERS
PUSHING IT AROUND
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR WATCHING
THANK GOD FOR THE ENGLISH PAPERS AND THEIR HONOURABLE SILENCE
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
YOU CAN'T FAULT THE MAN ON DETAIL
IT WOULD APPEAR
WHAT ABOUT CONSUM CHRISTINA
PEOPLE FEEL PERSONALLY INVOLVED
WHO WAS HE VISITING
YOUR WIFE'S SISTER
AT A COCKTAIL PARTY
I'LL THREATEN HER
SHE HAD BREAKFAST ON A TRAY THIS MORNING
A PASSING POLICEMAN WOULD HAVE OBLIGED FOR A CIGAR
FOUR MORE CELEBRITIES ABOUT TO PUT THEMSELVES TO THE TEST
EACH OF THEM EARNING SOME MONEY FOR A CHARITY OF THEIR CHOICE
THE USUAL RULES APPLY
TWO MINUTES OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT TWO MINUTES ON GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
IF THERE'S A TIE
I'VE NOT BEEN BACK TO SAUDI ARABIA
I COULDN'T AFFORD THE TAXI FARE TO GET TO DRAGONS' DEN THAT MORNING
AND WHEN I FIRST STARTED
THE LAST QUESTION I ALWAYS ASKED WAS
AND WHAT HYMN HAVE YOU CHOSEN
OR SHALL I TELL THE TRUTH
I JUST WANTED TO SAY HELLO
DIFFERENT WAYS OF WRITING A JOKE
AND THANKS FOR WATCHING
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CELEBRITY
AND THEY LIKE TO FEEL THEIR PROVIDERS
FOUR MORE FAMOUS FACES WILL SHOW US WHAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND HOW MUCH
THEY HAVE EACH DONATED THEIR FEE TO CHARITY
BUT THERE WILL BE A WINNER
IT'S NOT CHANGING BUT
BUT THE THING ABOUT IT IS
ALWAYS PART OF SOCIETY
SO IF WE'VE GOT TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
SO IT IS WITH GARDENING
THAT'S THAT'S VERY TRUE
AND TECHNOLOGY DOES HELP WITH OUR UNDERSTANDING THE SCIENCE OF IT IN TERMS OF PESTS AND DISEASES
HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM IN AN ECOLOGICAL WAY
THANKS FOR WATCHING
WITHIN A YEAR OF MARCONI'S FIRST TRANSMISSION
TO SEE WHAT I CAN FIND IN THE WAY OF WILDLIFE
TO HELP PROTECT SHIPPING FROM A SERIES OF HUGE SAND BANKS
IF WOULD HAVE USED WHALE OIL
SO REALLY THE CHANGE FROM OIL LIT LIGHTHOUSES THROUGH TO ELECTRICITY
AND STILL I'M STILL A FISHERMAN
WHICH I OFTEN COULD EVER DO
IF YOU'RE PLANNING A TRIP TO THE COAST THIS YEAR
WHY NOT HAVE ONE OF THESE TO JOT THE DATE DOWN
YOU CAN ORDER THE CALENDAR IN THREE WAYS
TO GIVE A BIT MORE PROTECTION AT VULNERABLE POINTS
AND MAKING IT EUROPE'S BUSIEST FERRY TERMINAL
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE CHALLENGE FACED BY A TEAM OF ROWERS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO ROW AROUND THE
THE SOUTHWEST OF ENGLAND DOES DRY UP AFTER WE SEE THAT MIXTURE OF RAIN
WALES SHOULD BE DRY AND SHOULD ACTUALLY BRIGHTEN UP A BIT IN THE AFTERNOON
NOT SO MUCH FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND
WHERE WE WILLLL SEE SOME SUNSHINE
MUCH BRIGHTER AND COLDER
MAYBE TOUCH OF FROST TO BEGIN WITH
AND WE WILL SEE SOME WINTRY SHOWERS COMING INTO SCOTLAND
IN THE WAY THAT'S TRUE BUT
JUST AFTER THE WAR I THINK
ON THE EARTH ITSELF
AH WE'RE VERY VERY CLOSE TO TOTALITY
IVE GOT SOME GREAT PICTURES AND HOPEFULLY OTHER PEOPLE WILL HAVE SOME TOO
I'VE HEARD THAT AS WELL
OVER THE YEARS WE'VE SPREAD BUTTER THAT'S PASSED THROUGH THIS PORT
I'VE GONE OLD SCHOOL
IT'S MORE OF PRAYER REFURBISHMENT RATHER THAN A RENOVATION
WHAT CAN WE TELL YOU ABOUT THE WILDCO
IF YOU LOOK AT IT
AS LONG AS YOU DO IT SYMPATHETICALLY
LOVELY ROOMS AND EXACTLY WHAT TOM AND LAURA WERE TALKING ABOUT
TWO HOUSES FOR THE PRICE OF ONE
SHALL I BE THE ONE TO TELL THOSE TWO
SHOULD MEET THEM
THIS IS MY FORTE
THIS IS DEFINITELY MORE DEFINED
I RECKON IT'S OVER BUDGET
IT LOOKS QUITE SMALL
THIS PLACE IS GOING TO AUCTION
YOU WANTED US TO FIND YOU A PLACE IN SOMERSET
THERE'S A PLATE
THIS PLACE WAS A HIVE OF ACTIVITY
YOU SPEN A BIT MORE TIME IN THE HOUSE
BUT BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THAT
WE'VE TOLD YOU A LIE
WE NOTICED YOUR PLANS THERE
OUR TEAMS WON'T BE TAKING ANY PRISONERS TODAY THOUGH
IS AN EXTREMELY RARE THING
AND THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE IS TELLING ME
NOT IF YOU'RE THE CELEBRATED NINETEENTH CENTURY ARCHITECT SIR JOHN SO
HIS SUBSTANTIAL MASS OF PAINTINGS NEEDED TO BE SHOWN
IT'S NOT SO BAD
I'LL STAY IN THE KITCHEN WITH A BEAKER WHILE YOU TWO TALK
WHAT A DEEP PSYCHIC BOND WE HAVE
NO HE'S NOT DOING IT PROFESSIONALLY YET
I'VE GOT TO TREAT IT WITH ACID
IT'S A BIT WHIFFY
A BERRY IS A SIMPLE
SO HOW DO THEY GET THEM FROM THE PLANT TO THE SUPERMARKET IN ONE PIECE
CLARENCE BIRDSEYE WAS A SCIENTIST
TIME TO FREEZE THE FISH
WHICH IS FANTASTIC
JUST WHAT I WANTED
NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN THE SUPERMARKET WITH THE KIDS
YOU CAN TELL THEM WHAT'S REALLY IN A MARSHMALLOW
HOW TO ROLL A MINI ROLL AND WHAT MAKES FISH FINGERS SO TASTY
I'D MUCH RATHER COME OUT FOR A WALK
BUT I STILL THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO BE A SCI FI FAN TO ENJOY THEM
DO JOIN US AGAIN
AND WE'VE BARELY BEEN HERE A FEW MINUTES
I'VE GOT A NEW JOB IN STRATFORD UPON EVEN
DO YOU WANT TO BE ISOLATED
WITHIN A COMMUNITY
YOU DO FIND THE ODDEST THINGS AS YOU WANDER AROUND LOVELY TOWNS LIKE EVESHAM
THE JAWBONE OF A BOWHEAD WHALE
TO HIS FRIEND DR COOPER
WHO LIVED IN THE TOWN
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE STREET NAMES
DATING BACK TO MEDIEVAL TIMES
WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THEY'VE ASKED FOR SO
ONE OF YOU DID BETTER RESEARCH THAN THE OTHER
FRONT TO BACK GORGEOUS
RATHER THAN THE SECOND SMALL BEDROOM
IN A WAY THEY COULD HAVE
YOU SLOW UP AT THE SAME POINT
ALL OF WHICH WILL COST MONEY
BECAUSE OF THE AREA WE'RE BUYING IN
WAIT YOU BE WANT SOMEWHERE TO GET YOUR FURNITURE IN
REALLY GREAT STORAGE SPACE
DOWN TO THE GROAT
IT JUST HAS A REALLY NICE FEEL
OH THIS IS THE NAME OF THE GAME
SO THE VIEWERS AT HOME
FOUR FAMOUS FACES EACH REPRESENTING A CHARITY OF THEIR CHOICE WILL FACE TWO MINUTES OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST
TWO MINUTES ON GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS THAT MUCH OF A BIG DIFFERENCE
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR WATCHING CELEBRITY MASTERMIND
I THINK WE'VE GOT JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING WE NEED
BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY
THAT IS THAT IS INTERESTING YOU KNOW
I WISH I WAS OUTSIDE
WHAT DO YOU THINK THOUGH
VERY CLOSE TO THE MOTORWAY
THE PROPERTY ITSELF
NOT THE CASE WITH PROPERTY TWO
THIS IS A PROJECT
FOR FIRST TIME BUYERS
THAT IS A REAL PLUS
THE WILD CARD TODAY IS A STUNNER
MEAN THIS REALLY IS SO MUCH HOUSE FOR THE MONEY
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT
I LIKE THESE TWO
THE ACCESS COMES FROM THAT SECOND BEDROOM
DO NOT SCRIMP WHEN IT COMES TO PRESENTATION
AND THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT IT IS IT'S BEEN DOUBLE GLAZED
BECAUSE SORTING THAT OUT WOULD HAVE COST A PRETTY PENNY
REALLY GROWN UP
JUST TO BE IN A HOUSE
THERE'S EVERYTHING TO PLAY FOR
AND THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO HEAR AS WELL
I JUST STARTED IMAGINING WHERE MY THINGS ARE GOING TO GO
IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE
YOU'RE STILL A WINNER
TO FIND THREE ITEMS TO TAKE AWAY AND SELL AT AUCTION FOR A PROFIT
AND THE VOICE OF A VIRGIN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A SPECIAL TIMBRE TO IT AND HENCE
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS
WE HAVE FOUR FAMOUS FACES
IT'S THE SPECIALIST SUBJECT ROUND FIRST
AND THEN GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
TWO MINUTES ON EACH
AND YET THE IRONY IS
IF YOU WATCHED IT NOW
AND YOU KNOW IT THROUGH A CERTAIN SITUATION
OR WRITE TO THE ADDRESS THAT YOU CAN SEE HERE
SHE HAD THE POSH PARTS
WE'VE NEVER HAD THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE VERSUS THE GIRL GUIDES
SO NOT THAT LONG A TIME
ONE BIRTHDAY LET IT SLIP SHE'D LIKE A TITANIC MEAL
BEING AN ARCHITECT
FOR ALL THE REASONS WE'VE MENTIONED
PROBABLY ONLY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE
WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO ITALY
WELCOME TO CELEBRITY MASTERMIND
MEAN YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
BUT I'VE BEEN LUCKY
START SOMETHING NEW FOR THEM
EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS DOING
YOU SOLD ME
I THINK AS WELL
WE' MOVE BACK IN A FEW SECONDS
AND YOU CAN GET TO THINKING
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT THERE ALWAYS IS
BUT OUR TEAMS CAN'T AFFORD TO HANG ABOUT
I'M ASSISTANT MANAGER FOR WELDON UNITED
GOING TO MADRID TO DO A JOB
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT
AFTER YOU'VE SOLD YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS
ON BARGAIN HUNT
WELCOME TO CELEBRITY MASTERMIND
THE CELEBRITIES HERE TONIGHT HAVE ALL CHOSEN TO RISK THE BLACK CHAIR ORDEAL FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR CHOSEN
THE USUAL RULES APPLY
TWO MINUTES OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND TWO MINUTES ON GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
THE TITLE OF MASTERMIND
YOU SEE WHAT PEOPLE DO TO PROPERTIES
IF THERE'S A TIE
I WASN'T A NATURAL TEACHER
SO WHERE DO YOU GO NEXT
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO TO WORK VERY HARD
THAT MEANS YOU ARE PLUS TWENTY SEVEN POUNDS ON THAT
HUNTING AND SHOOTING HAVE SHAPED THE LANDSCAPE OVER CENTURIES
GAMEKEEPING HAS HAD A HUGE INFLUENCE HERE
CHICKEN AND EGGS
BUT WOULD YOU FANCY LIVING IN ANY OF THEM
IT CALLED HORSE SAND FOR
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THAT'S OUT HERE
AND WE'LL HAVE TO TEST NOW EVERY SIXTY DAYS UNTIL WE GO CLEAR
NOW THERE'S STILL TIME TO GET YOUR HANDS ON THE COUNTRYFILE CALENDAR
JUST WHAT YOU NEED FOR THE BUSY YEAR AHEAD
POUNDS AND A MINIMUM OF FOUR POUNDS FROM EACH SALE WILL GO TO THE BBC'S CHILDREN IN NEED OF PE
ADAM WILL BE FINDING OUT WHAT SWANS REALLY WANT TO EAT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
I'VE TRAVELLED DOWN TO NEAR THE BORDER WITH MERSIDE TO MEET UP WITH ROBERT WEBSTER
A FARMER WHO I'VE BEEN TOLD DOES SOMETHING QUITE INTERESTING WITH HIS LEFT OVER POTATOES
SO THEY ARE A PROBLEM TO US
WED WE REALLY LIKE TO GET THEM OFF THE FARM
OR WE CAN TAKE THEM TO FEED THE BIRDS
DURING THE WINTER
WHEN IT'S REALLY HARSH CONDITIONS
AND FIVE HUNDRED OF THAT IS OVER OPEN WATER
THAT'S IT FOR NOW
I HONOURED MY FATHER WHILE HE WAS ALIVE
I WILL HONOUR HIM AGAIN NOW
WENT MY WATER TO GIVE
NEITHER IN WORD
IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO PROVIDE NOW WHAT IS
WE MUST CALL FOR THE CONSTABLE
WHILE ANNIE'S STILL A BABY
BUT DIDN'T I BORROW FROM THE INNKEEPER
I WILL FIND WHO STOLE YOUR MONEY
MY APPRENTICES HAVE MADE LITTLE PROGRESS SINCE MATTHEW LEFT US
BEFORE WE KNOW IT
AS PER HEADQUARTERS COMMANDMENTS
YET I FEAR IF THERE IS A FUSS ABOUT THIS
HEADQUARTERS MIGHT NOT BE AS DILIGENT AS YOU SUPPOSE
OH YOU KNOW SUCH THINGS
ALFIE HAS HUMAN FRAILTY
I DO HAVE A REMEDY FOR HUMAN FRAILTY
AND I WILL USE IT AS A PLATFORM TO EXPOSE STEER FORTH AS THE CROOK THAT HE IS
MY THINKING WAS NOT MY OWN
I AM GRATEFUL FOR YOUR INTERVENTION
I KNOW THAT NOW
I DON'T SLEEP MUCH THREE OR FOUR HOURS
I READ PAPERS
WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS
LOTS AND LOTS OF LAND
WE HAVE A BRAND THAT'S VERY
FROM MY STANDPOINT
IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY WHAT YOU'RE WORTH
BUT I WOULD SAY WELL OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS
AT LEAST SIX BILLION
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THAT INTERESTING
WHY IS THAT SORT OF UPHELD AS A GREAT THING
TO FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF YOUR FAMILY
BUT IF WE'RE INCOMPETENT
I'LL FIRE YOU LIKE A DOG IF I DON'T THINK YOU LOVE WHAT YOU DO
SO IT'S A TOUGH REALITY
AND IF THEY DON'T DESERVE IT
BUT THEYRE REALLY WORKING HARD
WHENEVER ANYTHING WAS ON ABOUT CEREMONIAL
SHE COULD SIT AT THE TELEVISION AND JUST WATCH
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY COMFORTABLE
ABSOLUTELY NO UNDERSTATEMENT EVER
ALL WILL BE WELL
OUT OF BAD COMES GOOD
BUT HERE IT'S ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO
CHOOSING THE NEW MATTRESS FOR THE HOTEL COLLECTION
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY TALL BUILDING
IT'S SIXTY EIGHT STORIES
AND TALL AND HE REALISD THAT THE VALUE HE PAID FOR THE AIR RIGHTS WAS A SMALL
A FEW STORIES HIGH MEANING IT HADN'T BOTHERED TO CLAIM ITS AIR RIGHTS HE BOUGHT THEM
WHETHER IT'S STEVEN SPIELBERG OR ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER OR SO MANY OTHERS
AFTER FIVE YEARS OF YOU KNOW EFFORT TO GET TO THIS POINT
IF YOU'VE GOT IT
LET'S MEET THEM
EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES TURNS TO GOLD
MY FATHER SAID THE SAME
AND I THOUGHT I WAS SORT OF INVINCIBLE AND
AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC EYE
MEANING LOTS OF FINANCING
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN THE VALUES COME DOWN
IT WAS A TIME OF TREMENDOUS INTROSPECTION FOR HIM
AND IT THE FIRST ONE WAS A BOY
AND THE THIRD ONE WAS A BOY AGAIN
I DON'T EVEN BLAME ANYTHING
IT'S VERY TOUGH
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO US ALL
HIS WAY IS TO SAY
OBVIOUSLY WITH DONALD HAVING HIS NAME ON THE BUILDING
HE CARES A LOT ABOUT THE BUILDING
HE STOPS HERE EVERY COUPLE MONTHS
HE'LL HAVE THEM REMOVED
WHERE THEY USE THE NAME TRUMP
BUT DONALD TRUMP LETS ME LOOK AT IT AND GO
MEANING IT'LL ALWAYS ATTRACT PEOPLE TO WATCH
MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK AT THEM AS AN ANACHRONISM
AND THE RATINGS ARE INCREDIBLE
AND NBC LOVES US
AND REALLY THE WORLD AND
IN TERMS OF MISS UNIVERSE
IT'S MARK BURNETT
NOT MANY PEOPLE STROLLING BY
BUT IT'S MADE MY LIFE TOUGHER
WITH THE APPRENTICE
HEY THAT'S THAT GUY I HEARD ABOUT
BUT I COULD WALK OUT ON THE STREET AND YOU KNOW WALK SOMEPLACE
EVER QUOTED MATTHEW SEVEN
VERSE TWENTY FOUR AT HIM TI A FOOLISH MAN WHO BUILDS HIS HOUSE ON SAND
PRESUMABLY THE SAME COULD APPLY FOR HOTELS OR HOLIDAY LETS
BUT I'M SURE THAT FOOLISH MAN
FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT
WE'VE HAD TREMENDOUS SUPPORT FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS
BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT
THEY'RE VERY VERY CAPABLE KIDS
WE'VE SEEN MANY FAMILIES IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS BREAK UP WHEN THEY HAVE THAT WAR OVER WHO'S GOING TO TAKE
BUT I WILL SAY THAT WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IS THAT THEY'RE ALL EQUAL
I'VE NEVER BEEN A BIG BELIEVER IN THAT
YOU ALWAYS NEED A BOSS
I KNOW THESE PEOPLE
AND I WOULDN'T SWITCH BUT
BUT FORBES HAS ME DOWN AT TWO AND THREE BILLION DOLLARS
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW MY ASSETS
BUT BECAUSE IT'S AMERICA
TODAY HE MARKETS TO EVERYONE
THROUGH THE PRODUCTS HE LICENSES
AND THROUGH HIS CHILDREN
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY SIMPLE BECAUSE THE ONLY THING HE'S EVER REALLY SOLD IS DONALD TRUMP
I THINK OF MYSELF AS SOMEBODY THAT REALLY ENJOYS WHAT HE DOES
BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT GETS TO THE HEART OF WHAT SCIENCE ITSELF
WHERE IS THE CONTROL CENTRE
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE
THIS CONVICTION IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL AND ENDURING IN HUMAN HISTORY
WHY DO I HAVE THESE HOPES
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL
WHAT IS THIS I ANYWAY
AND THEY FEATURE PEOPLE
IF I PINCH MY FINGER
THEN THE PAIN FIBRES GO DOWN THE LINE
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
AS HE LATER WROTE
I WAS GRIPPED BY AN IRRESISTIBLE MANIA
WE WOULD HAVE CRACKED THE PROBLEM
HE SUGGESTED THAT BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND
YOU COULD LOOK INTO YOURSELF
AND LEARN ABOUT HUMAN NATURE THAT WAY
HERE IN AMERICA
MANY PEOPLE IN MY FIELD
THAT LED HIM TO HIS GREATEST INVENTION
WE HAVE THESE MODELS RUNNING IN OUR HEAD
AND LET'S BE HONEST
I'M INSPIRED BY LAURIE
WHERE WE'RE BASED HERE
AND ON THE CUSP OF QUINTON
YOU GET HARBORNE
AND SHE HAS STEERED ME TO THIS BEAUTY
I AM IN BARTLEY GREEN
BUT NOT ACTUALLY IN QUINTON
WE HAVE OUR WONDERFUL WILD CARD
SO IT'S KIND OF THE NEAREST FOR HIM IN TERMS OF COMMUTE
THOSE ARE THE PROPERTIES
AND AND WITH AN OPEN MIND
I THINK IF YOU SHOW THESE GUYS THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY THE FINISHED ARTICLE
YOU'VE HAD YOUR LITTLE LOOK AROUND
YOU ARE CASH YOU ARE READY TO GO
THESE GUYS GOT MEMORIES OF THE DAY THEY BUILT AN EXTENSION SOMEWHERE IN GLOUCESTER
THROUGHOUT THE SHOW THROUGHOUT THE EPISODE SO FAR
JUST GOING AROUND THE HOUSE
RECORD THIS EPISODE
WE SHOULD BE ANYWAY
BUT YOU CHOSE JUST DRIVE MY ONE
IN ANY WAY TO PERHAPS DO A LITTLE MORE EXERCISE
I WANT TO SAY YES
IF YOU'RE OUT THERE AND YOU NEED ME AND NIKKI
AND WHEN WE GOT THEM HOME
WHERE WE'VE BEEN GREETED BY THE PROPRIETOR
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
STUFFED UP WITH PEOPLE
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT
HE REALISES THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
NOT FOR THE LATE ONES
WHAT TO DO WITH IT
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S BEEN CUT
A THIS TYPE OF THING
IT WAS KIND OF COLOURING IN
AS WELL AS BEING A SILVER TONGUED SALESMAN
AND I WOULD SAY THAT THEY ARE
AND IN TIMBER THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE COLOUR
BUT FOR THE CLIENT WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE PLAN
IF WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE TYRINGHAM APART
ON THIS HAPPY NOTE
SELLING AT FORTY NOW
YOUR SCORE IS MINUS THIRTY NINE PO
LET'S GET ON WITH IT
I FINISHED UP TEACHING
WHO DIED IN NINETEEN FORTY
AND IT WAS HIS BEQUEST THAT GAVE IT TO THE NATIONAL TRUST
HOW CAN I PUT IT
SEVENTY FIVE ANYWHERE ELSE
ARE JUST A BIT SHY OF THE ESTIMATES
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE ITEM TO WORRY ABOUT
IN WATER SPORTS
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE SNOWBOARDING BUT ON WATER
SO LONG AS YOU LISTEN TO WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY
YEAH IT'S VERY MUCH A TECHNICAL SPORT
IT'S NOT A STRENGTH SPORT
THAT'S A GALLON
VERY SPECIAL FOR JAPANESE PEOPLE
WELL MOST OF THE ROOMS AS MR WADE HAD THEM
AND WHERE HE KEPT HIS COSTUME
HIS FAMILY MOTTO WAS TO LET NOTHING PERISH
AND THANKS TO THE WORK OF CLAIRE AND HER TEAM
ALL ABOUT TURNING
YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT ALL THESE BUMPS AND ALL THE BERMS TO USE
TO A LARGE EXTENT
SO IS THIS NEW ROUTE ESSENTIAL PROGRESS
OR ARE WE IN DANGER OF LOSING SOME OF OUR MOST BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE
IT'S A REAL STRANGE MIX OF EMOTION SO FEELING A BIT DAFT WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE HELPING YOU OUT AND THEN THE JOURNEY
WHEN YOU DO NEED THEM
ON A FREEZING COLD DAY LIKE THIS
THE SUMMER SEEMS LIKE A DISTANT MEMORY BUT
BUT BACK IN JUNE
WE CAN GIVE EGGS AND LEMONS TO PEOPLE
AS PLANS FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL LINK BETWEEN LONDON AND BIRMINGHAM BECOME CLEARER
OPPOSITION HAS BECOME MORE FIERCE
JOURNEY TIMES WILL BE CUT
BUT THE TRACK WILL SLICE THROUGH SOME OF OUR MOST BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE
BUT CRITICS SAY IT'S GOING TO DESTROY VAST SWATHES OF BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE AND MANY VILLAGES AND
THE CRITICISM IS AT ITS HIGHEST
SO THERE ARE LOCAL CHOICES THAT YOU CAN MAKE TO MITIGATE SOME OF SOME OF THE IMPACT
I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS
IT'S THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S THAT'S RUNNING THIS AND
EVERY INDICATION WE'VE HAD IS THAT THEY WILLING TO LISTEN TO LOCAL CONCERNS
THE MORE THEY LOOKED INTO IT
WELL I'M REALLY POSITIVE
I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET A DESSERT
I WASN'T SURE WHETHER THEY WOULD BE
THINGS HAVEN'T REALLY CHANGED THAT MUCH
TWO THOUSAND MILES ACROSS
WHY ARE YOU CONDUCTING THIS BATTLE OF THE RHINES
YOUR CONSCIENCE WILL REST APPEASED IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE DIRECTED THOSE FAR OFF GODLESS
OUR NEIGHBOURS EAST
YOU MAY PURCHASE THEM
OUTSIDE OF MY WORKING HOURS
FOR MY OWN PURPOSES
THOUGH IT MIGHT DEPEND UPON WHAT THOSE PURPOSES ARE
A MAN CAN ONLY RISE ABOVE THE CROWD IF HE PUTS SOMETHING OF VALUE INTO THE WORLD
A PATENT CAN BE THE MAKING OF A MAN
HOWEVER GENEROUS THEY ARE
THAT WOULD BE THE REAL LOSS
THOUGH WE CANNOT MAKE OUR SUN STAND STILL YET WE WILL MAKE HIM
HOW CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT DANIEL WOULD ALLOW HIS NEWSPAPER TO PERPETRATE SUCH A SCANDAL
BUT ONE CANNOT HELP BUT DELIGHT IN HER
IF YOU WIN THE COMPETITION
IS THAT IT SEEMS TO ME
I AM INFUSED WITH CONFIDENCE
EVEN IF I DO WIN
I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS TO APPEASE ME
HOW IS YOUR WIFE RECOVERING FROM HER OWN LOSS
IF I MAY BE SO BOLD
I HOPE I HAVE SERVED YOU WELL IN MY ADJUDICATION
I AM NO LITERARY EXPERT
FOR OUR ANCESTORS
AND ABOUT THE ROLE OF MAN IN DESTROYING THEM
INVADERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE BLAME THE ROMANS
AND THOSE PERENNIAL SCAPEGOATS
IN THIS BROWN GUNGE
BOTH COOL AND WET CONDITIONS MEAN THAT THE WATER TABLE IN THIS PE STARTS TO RISE
WHAT DIDN'T GROW FAST
THAT AMBITION WAS FIRMLY FIXED ON MILITARY MIGHT
ON THE BA PERSER HILLS AROUND THE CASTLE
BEFORE WE HEAD OFF TO THE AUCTION
BECAUSE IT'S LIGHTWEIGHT AND EXTREMELY STRONG
YOU ARE PLUS FIVE
I SAID WHAT I SAID
UM WE MET ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO AT UNIVERSITY
RECENTLY I MADE MONEY ON A TWENTYP PIECE THAT DIDN'T HAVE A DATE ON IT
BECAUSE IT'S LOVELY TO HEAR THAT
WHAT YOU WHAT DID THEY MAKE THAT FOR
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I'D DO IT AGAIN
THEY PUT A LOT OF LIFE INTO YOUR LIFE
I'VE SOLD THEM IN THE PAST
THEY'RE CLEAN OUT OF TIME
I'D REALLY LIKE IT
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW
AND THEN OFF THEY'D GO
ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK
YOU CAN FEEL IT
AND IT ONE OF THE OLDEST TOWNS IN THE AREA
IT'S QUITE A QUAINT PLACE
WHEN A COMBINATION OF NEWER TECHNIQUES INLAND
PLUS A HEAVY TAX
OR THE HIGH TIDES
THIS IS A GLORIOUS TIME TO BE ABLE TO SAY
IT GOES BACK CERTAINLY TO
BECAUSE SHE HAD SOMETHING LIKE FIVE HUSBANDS
EACH COUPLE IS TRIED AGAINST THE FLITCH
AND EVEN MORE TRYING TO HOLD ONTO IT
THE OTHERS ONLY GET GAMMON
IT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE SWEETNESS AND LIGHT
WHEN THERE WAS LESS THREAT OF A NUCLEAR ATTACK
IT HAD MANY LIVES
THEN THE GUARD WOULD TURN ROUND AND THE PLOUGHMAN WOULD WAVE AND DAD WOULD ZIP DOWN AGAIN
IT WAS ONLY ABOUT HUNDRED
OF COURSE WE HAD NATIONAL SERVICE
SO EVERYBODY WAS
AND EVERYBODY WAS WELL AWARE OF WHAT WAR COULD DO TO YOU WITH LOOSE TALK AND SO
AND SO IT'S FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM LONDON TO BE NEAR ENOUGH
THERE AREN'T MANY OPEN TO THE PUBLIC
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO
SO FARMING IS GOING TO BE MY LIFE STILL
BUT THIS IS A NICE DIVERSIFICATION
IT'S REASSURING FOR PILOTS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO KNOW THAT A GROUP OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND
SO WE SET OFF AND ON OUR WAY
WOULD THAT STILL SELL
AND WITH THE CONCORD ASSOCIATION
THERES SORT A BRISTOL BLUE
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
FOR YOU GUYS AT HOME
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT IT
THE QUANTOCK HILLS BECAME ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES IN ENGLAND TO BE PROTECTED FOR THEIR OUTSTANDING
THREE MILES AWAY
WE'RE VERY BUSY YEAH
TO RIDE INTO BATTLE
TO ENCOURAGE ME TO GET INTO RARE BREED CONSERVATION
MY DAD GAVE ME AN EX MORE PONY
AND I STILL LOVE THEM AND HAVE A SMALL HERD AT HOME
FOOD SHORTAGES AREN'T SOMETHING WE'RE USED TO IN THE UK
BUT POOR HARVESTS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE LED TO RECORD PRICES AND REAL FEARS THAT THE FOOD
ARE SEEING QUITE SIGNIFICANT HIKES ON THE WORLD MARKETS
SO THAT CAN JUST BE YOUR BOTTLE OF VEGETABLE
IN THIS COUNTRY
RICH SELF CONTAINED
SELF SUFFICIENT FARMING OPERATION IS WORKING WELL
BUT NOW AGRICULTURE FACES SOME MASSIVE CHALLENGES AS WELL AS SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES
AND I KNOW WHY I LOVE IT
HIGH TECH PEOPLE
AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR ENVIRONMENT
WITH ALL MODERN EQUIPMENT
THE VICTORIANS BELIEVED YOU COULD GET RID OF FRECKLES WITH IT
SO WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS YOU'VE GOT THIS AQUIFER SYSTEM THAT EMERGES IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS WHERE THE TOPOGRAPHY'S
THIS IS WATER THAT'S RUNNING NONTOP
IT PRODUCES AROUND ABOUT ONE POINT
AND I FOR ONE CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THAT INTENSE PEPPERY FLAVOUR
BUT AS WE HEARD FROM JOHN EARLIER
POOR HARVESTS AROUND THE WORLD COULD LEAD TO HUGE SHORTAGES
SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT
BECAUSE HE'S EXTREMELY VALUABLE
THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED PLOTS ON ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT SITES
BUT THE MAJORITY HAVE AND IN SOME AREAS
THE HIGHEST THAT IT'S EVER BEEN
TWELVE NEW GROWING SPACES IN LONDON BY TWO THOUSAND AND
ALLOTMENT SPACE IS NOW QUITE UNETTABLE
AND LONDON IS FULL OF LOTS OF EMPTY SPACE
SEMI DERELICT SPACES
I'LL BE MEETING UP WITH SOME INCREDIBLY RARE OTTER ORPHANS AS THEY ENTER AN IMPORTANT STAGE OF
I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE HONOUR AND ACCOLADE OF ORGANISING THE CHURCH BAZAAR
I'VE SEEN YOU WITH YOUR BOOKS
YOU ARE MY WITNESS
AN AFFIRMATION OF ALL THAT I BELIEVE
NOT ONLY WILL I COMPOSE A LETTER
SUSTAINS US AND
HELD THEM CLOSE
LANDSEER WAS ALSO AN ARTIST
ALL ANXIOUS TO DO AS THE QUEEN DID
THE DISPOSSESSED WERE TIDIED AWAY
SO WE'LL LET YOU BE RUDE TO THEM
FAIRLY STAUNCH DEFENDERS OF THEIR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
AND THEIR PRIVACY
EVENTUALLY A TOTAL OF TWENTY
THE MONEY WAS SPENT ON LAND ADJOINING THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE
WILL THEY STILL REMAIN FRIENDS AT THE END OF THE DAY
I LIKE LOTS OF THINGS
I COLLECT ALL SORTS OF STUFF
I GO TO ANTIQUE FAIRS
WE DO CAR BOOT SALES
WE'RE LOOKING FOR CERTAIN THINGS
JUST NORTH OF ASHBOURNE IN DERBYSHIRE
ONE THING'S FOR CERTAIN
REPRESENTING BRITAIN IN BRUSSELS
A COUPLE OF CENTURIES BEFORE THE EU
THAT'S EXACTLY WHO I'M TRYING TO SELL IT TO
SO I THINK YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT
I JUST DON'T KNOW
AND AS A RIGHT BOTTLE
IT'S GOT IT'S GOT SOMETHING FOR ME IN THE WAY OF A DOG BED
THAT'S MINUS TEN
WHICH COULD BE A WINNING SCHOOL
WHICH MEANS OVERALL YOU'RE NOW MINUS TEN
DON'T WORK WITH CHILDREN OR ANIMALS
WHEN THE CHILDREN MET
IT'S SOMETHING I DO AS A PART TIME THING WHEN I FINISHED WORK
AND OLD MAPS OF FARMS
RENOVATED AND REFURBISHED BY HERBERT AND DESIGNED AS AN ELOQUENT
THE BIG QUESTION IS TODAY
ARE ANY OF OUR TEAMS GOING TO FINISH UP BY BEING EITHER SUMPTUOUS OR
WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE HEART OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE
CHOOSE LATER AFTER THE SALE OF YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS
THAT'S THE POSITIVE WAY FORWARD
WITH OUR AUCTIONEER OF THE MOMENT
PRETTY PIECE AT EIGHTY FIVE
YOU ARE NOW PLUS THIRTY ONE
BO FIVE IF YOU LIKE NOW
TWO ALL OVER THE PLACE
I'M NOT ASKING ENOUGH
SIX NOW ANYWHERE
WHICH WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IN MANDARIN
AND THREE HUNDRED POUNDS WITH WHICH TO MAKE A PROFIT AT AUCTION
THAT SHOULD GET THEM EXCITED
SO THE FIRST TIME WE ACTUALLY MET WAS AT THE BARGAIN HUNT INTERVIEW
I WOULD HOPE SO
WHICH IS A CHINESE ALLOY
BUT SMELLS LIKE SILVER BUT NOT AS EXPENSIVE AS SILVER AND YOU DON'T NEED TO POLISH IT
GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT MORE
YOU WOULD HAVE NINE
YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING NEXT
WILL BE TRYING TO FIND THREE ITEMS ON WHICH TO MAKE A PROFIT LATER AT AUCTION
LET'S GET SEARCHING
LET'S GET HUNTING
ARE YOU EXCITED
AMONGST THESE THREE
WE CHANGED ROLES
AND IF THIS DOESN'T MAKE A PROFIT
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED THEM
I'M GLAD YOU'VE FOUND SOMETHING TOGETHER
BEFORE WE HAND THE LOVELY LOLLY OVER TO THE EXPERTS
WHICH IS CALLED THE BONUS BUY
THIS IS WHEN ANY LEFTOVER LOLLY IS GIVEN TO THE EXPERTS
IT'S TRICKY THEN BECAUSE THE TEAMS HAVE LITERALLY ONLY SECONDS TO DECIDE WHETHER TO GO WITH THE
FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OR SO
THE FITZHERBERTS DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO MODERNISE IT AND GET UP TO DATE WITH CUTTING
WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND OURSELVES IN DERBY
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT
GOOD LUCK ON THE ROS FROM
AT TWENTY IN THE THIRD ROW
ALL THE BIDS VERY CLOSE TOGETHER
I ALWAYS PUT THE FISH BACK FROM THE DON
JOHN HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING
IT IS ABOUT THE BIG SOCIETY
ABOUT TRANSFERRING WOODLANDS INTO COMMUNITIES WHEREVER POSSIBLE
FACT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE GREATER PROTECTION FOR THE PUBLIC
AND THIS WEEK ADAM IS EXPLORING A NEW KIND OF FARMING WITH PEOPLE AT ITS HEART
THEY NOW HAVE GOT AN ADULT LIFE
THE SAME AS THEIR PEERS
THAT'S A GREAT THING
ON A FINE DAY THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE A DAY OUT ON THE OPEN ROAD
AND THEY'RE STILL HIGHLY PRIZED TODAY
HE ALWAYS HAD THIS IDEA IN THE BACK OF HIS MIND
JOHN REPORTED ON THE CAMPAIGN TO SAVE OUR FORESTS FROM PRIVATISATION
BUT ARE CONCERNS ABOUT ACCESS JUSTIFIED
IT'S BACK TO JOHN
AND IT'S BEEN THE PRIVATE PROPERTY OF THE EARLS OF LONSDALE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MEET THE HONEST OBJECTIVES
PRODUCING SOME TIMBER TO SELL
WE VERY MUCH CARE ABOUT THE WOODLANDS
WE HAVE CARED ABOUT THE WOODLANDS FOR FIVE HUNDRED YEARS ON THIS ESTATE
WE MICROMANAGE THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MEET ALL OUR OBJECTIVES PRODUCING TIMBER
CARING FOR THE WILDLIFE
DO BUT AS A NATION WE REALLY BENEFIT PARTICULAR
IN THE HEART OF THE WINDFELL FOREST
AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER
AND IF YOU LIMIT ACCESS AND RESTRICT ACCESS IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM
SO WHATEVER THEY MAY BE WE HAVE EVERY INTENTION OF PROTECTING THOSE
THROUGH EITHER TERMS IN A LEASE
TERMS IN A SALE CONTRACT
AND MAINLY BECAUSE IF WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO TRANSFER
A LOT OF THEM TO LOCAL CHARITABLE TRUSTS
THOUSAND ACRES OF IT
AND I'M GOING TO BE JOINING HER FOR A BIT OF FRIENDLY COMPETITION BUT FIRST
THE SUN IS OUT HERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SHEFFIELD
HERE'S THE COUNTRYFI FORECAST
THERE WAS A PRIZE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS
MATT'S ON HIS WAY TO HAVE A GO
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PRACTISING FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS
ANYWAY THAT'S IT THE COUNTRY FILE FOR THIS WEEK
THE MEAT FAVOURED BY HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN
US WITH SO MUCH
YOU MUST MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME
AND I ALWAYS WILL
YOU DO BELIEVE IN ME
HOW FARES HIS MAJESTY
MY ONLY DESIRE IN LIFE
THEN HE CUT LOVE ME
I DO NOT HAVE A CALCULATION FOR LOVE
AND I SHALL COOK MINE
I CANNOT RESIST
DIDN'T NEED NO FAIR TO MAKE YOU ONE
CAN'T SLEEP WITHOUT A BED
I TOOK YOU IN AS MY GUEST
SHE HAS DRAWN HER SHINING SWORD OF JUSTICE
FOR ALL THESE DELIGHTS
THE CHAOTIC MATERIAL OF FUTURE SUNS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
NOT JUST STARS LIKE THE SUN
THE TRAPEZIUM NEBULA
OR THE TRIPLE STAR
ARMPIT OF THE GREAT ONE
IF YOU HAVE MASSIVE STARS THEY DON'T LIVE FOR VERY LONG
THEY'RE THE ROCK STARS OF THE UNIVERSE
AND IF THEYVE IF THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN STARS HERE THAT HAVE EXPLODED AS SUPERNOVAE THEN THAT WILL HAVE SENT
AND SO I HAVE HERE A RECONSTRUCTION
WE SEE ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL STAR CLUSTERS
BUT IT ALSO BLOCKS OUR VIEW TO THE OUTSIDE UNIVERSE
EITHER THIS WAY OR INTO THE SCREEN HERE
AND IT'S THERE IN THE TOP LEFT OF THE CONSTELLATION
AND ONE OF THE BROTHERS
THEY ASSUMED THAT THEY WERE THEY WERE ALMOST INEXHAUSTIBLE
ABOUT TO BE BLUDGEONED TO DEATH BY A CRUEL HUNTER
HAVE FELT QUITE DISCONNECTED FROM THE SEAS
THIS ISN'T ABOUT STOPPING FISHING
SO WHEN YOU FIRST MET
BEFORE I RETIRED
AND WE WORK WITH THE US MILITARY
AND I LIKE THAT WHOLE LOOK
AND YET I'M STILL HOLDING IT
BECAUSE OF THE NAME
WHAT GOES ON IN CENTRAL WIS BEACH
I HEAR YOU SHRIEK
WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO HANG ON TO HIS CUSTOMERS' MONEY FOR SAFEKEEPING
THE YOUNG QUAKER BUSINESSMAN HAD SET UP THE TOWN'S FIRST OFFICIAL
BEING A HARDWOOD
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE OVERLOOKED
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
AND A CERTAIN UNOSTENTATIOUS WAY OF LIVING
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
SO THE BIG PROBLEM
IF THEY'VE GOT A PROBLEM AT ALL
AND SO SOME HOPE THERE
YEAH GOT TWO HOPEFULS
VERY LOW ALTITUDE
THAT MEANT THAT HE WAS
AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK YOU HAVE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT HE WAS AS A PERSON AND WHAT HE WAS AS
HE COULDN'T MAKE IT
WHICH IS WHEN I WAS COMMANDING ONE SQUADRON
AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS AT WAR
WHETHER YOU WERE A LABOURER OR A DRIVER OR A WIFE
SO MUCH THE BETTER
AND WHEN THE AUTHORITIES FOUND OUT HIS REAL AGE
AND I NEVER KNEW HIM AS JACK LIDDELL
SHOULD BE REMEMBERED
ORIGINALLY FROM MY FATHER
HE FAILED TO BECOME A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
BEING RECEIVED IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR AND MANUFACTURED THAT YEAR
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
ARE OUR TEAMS GOING TO MAKE A MASSIVE PROFIT IN A MOMENT OVER AT THE AUCTION
OR ARE WE GOING TO PUT THEM ON A SLOW BOAT TO CHINA
YOU GAVE THE BOY ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN POUNDS OF LEFTOVER LOLLY
AT EIGHTY FIVE ON THE INTERNET
PO FIFTY FIVE ANYWHERE ELSE
BUT WHAT ABOUT JOHN MCKINNON
THERE WERE ONLY FIVE OF US IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL
THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE
WE SEE THE SEALS
AND PLENTY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF BIRDS
AND THEY MOUNTED FIERCE RESISTANCE AGAINST THE POWERFUL VIKING INVADERS
JUST BECAUSE OF THE WIND
SO THEY'RE ELABORATE
BUT THE CHIEF'S OWN PERSONAL FLEET
BUT THE DOG LOVES IT
AND WE WERE SENT OUT TO SEARCH
WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT I'M PART OF A MOUNTAIN RESCUE TEAM
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY A FULLY TRAINED SEARCH DOG
AND HANDLERS JUST OUT OF SHOT AT THE MOMENT
THE BBC LAUNCHED BBC ALBA
WARM WELCOME LIKE THAT OF SOMEONE YOU'VE NEVER MET BEFORE
SO THEY'D BE PASSED DOWN THROUGH GENERATIONS
ALL SPLENDID SOUNDING SCOTTISH NAMES
BUT THEY'RE NOT CLANS OR PATTERNS OF TARTANS
UM WHEN WE WERE ABOUT FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN
AS MUCH AS THAT
IS THE ONE THAT I WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO TAKE HOME BECAUSE YOU DO REWIRE THAT AND YOU DO PUT A LAMP SHADE ON AND IT
THAT WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR IN GENTEEL SOCIETY
WHAT MIGHT THEY MAKE IN A SPECIALIST SALE
IT REALLY IS NOTHING
THERE'S STILL MONEY IN THAT
WHICH IS YOUR BIG
WE'RE NOT GETTING GOOD CASTS
IF THIS THING WAS PAINTED ON OAK
IT WOULD FEEL THE SAME TEMPERATURE ON EITHER SIDE
SO IT'S IT'S AN OLD PIECE OF PLASTER ISN'T
THEY SAY TIME WAITS FOR NO MAN
IT'S GOING TO BE
LOOKING UP WHEN BARGAIN HUNTS ON
AND WHEN YOU DO THE CALCULATION
THAT'S ABOUT EIGHTY
THOUSAND CUBIC METRES OF PEAT
SO THAT'S ABOUT NINETY
SHOVELS AND WHEELBARROWS
FOR THAT DAY AND AGE
MORE JOBS FOR HIGHLANDERS
MORE UNSIGHTLY INDUSTRIES IN THE HALEN' HEART
DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS
SO IS THIS QUIET CORNER OF GLOUCERSHIRE FLAMBOYANT ENOUGH TO QUALIFY
AS WE WOULD LOOK AT IT NOW
AND TO MAKE GIANT ONES I THINK HE SO MUCH FUN
I ACTUALLY MAKE THREE DIFFERENT SIZES OF THESE AS WELL
THERE'S BEEN NO ANSWER
IT'S SO INCREDIBLY PEACEFUL LIKE
UNFORTUNATELY THEIR VAN BROKE DOWN ON THE WAY HERE
SOME OF THESE NEST IN LITTLE HOLES IN THE GROUND
SHE'S GOT HOLES ALL OVER THE WALLS HERE
AND HIS BEST KNOWN WORK
SO INSTEAD HE CONCENTRATED ON COMPOSING
WHICH IS JUST AS WELL REALLY BECAUSE HE ENDED UP WRITING OVER TWO HUNDRED WORKS
INCLUDING THE HYMN OF JESUS
AND THE CORAL FANTASIA
THIS IS THEIR PRESENTER
THERE ARE VARIOUS CREWS FROM THE UK
THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
DON'T GET ME WRONG
I'LL BE GOING INSIDE TO TAKE A LITTLE TOUR OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM WITH ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST EMINENT
I TEND TO BE EXTREMELY PASSIONATE ABOUT OUR OWN PLANET AND ALL THE LIFE ON IT
I CAN'T HELP BUT BE FILLED WITH AWE AND WONDER AT OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND WHAT MIGHT LIE BEYOND
THEY MEANT NOTHING TO US THEN
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN THEM
I FELT QUITE OVERWHELMED
BUT JUST SEEN THE ANIMALS GOING FOR ONE MINUTE ALIVE
YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE WAS PAYING ME TO DO IT
IT WASN'T VERY EASY BUT
WE HAD TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HAVING SOMETHING UNIQUE TO BRING PEOPLE BACK TO THE VALLEY AND BACK TO
SO WE'VE GOT TO
DON'T GET INVOLVED
I FEEL I COULD FIT RIGHT IN HERE
AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THAT EASY NOW
THIS ONE TICKS ALL THE BOXES
THERE WAS A FATER OR A BLACKSMITH
WE'RE OFF TO COUNTY ANTRIM IN NORTHERN IRELAND SO
SO WE HOPE YOU CAN JOIN US THEN
THAT'S ALL FROM COUNTRYFI AND
THOMAS BROWN IS AWAY
WE MIGHT PUSH MEN AWAY
PERHAPS WHAT I MEAN IS
DO I BRING IT TO LARK RISE AND PERFORM A DEMONSTRATION BEFORE FARMER MORRIS
YOU HAVE NEVER KNOWN WHAT IT IS TO BE CLOSE TO A MAN
MIGHT I ASK YOU
YOU WILL RISK A REPUTATION FOR NO MORE THAN THE PUFFING UP OF A MAN'S PRIDE
WAS A GARDENER ON A BIG ESTATE NEARBY
IF I EVER PUSH IN
AND I AM GLAD THAT NO REAL HARM HAS BEEN DONE
I LOVE JAPANESE PORCELAIN
I'VE GOT A SMALL COLLECTION
AND DO YOU CHECK IT OUT
AS YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS
BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS
WHICH OF OUR CONTESTANTS TODAY IS GOING TO MAKE A THUMPING GREAT PROFIT
THAT IS SUCH BAD LUCK
BECAUSE THAT'S PLUS TWENTY FIVE
WE HAVE TWO TEAMS
EACH WITH THREE HUNDRED POS AND AN HOUR TO SHOP FOR THREE ITEMS
DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT MAKES A PROFIT OR NOT
NOW BEFORE WE HAND OVER THAT LEFTOVER LOLLY TO DAVID BARBY
YOU GAVE KATE SEVENTY FIVE
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED
IRENE AND DAVID
NOT ALL THE CERAMICS ON SHOW AT HANBURY COME FROM THE WATNEY COLLECTION
BUT THE TWO FACTORIES CAME TOGETHER AS A RESULT OF WILLIAM DUESBURY
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE MINUS TEN
FROM ENFIELD IN NORTH LONDON
BUT TO GET THE PRIZE MONEY
ANYTHING FROM FIVE
I THINK YOU'VE NOT BEEN READING MANY DAILY NEWSPAPERS
VERY PART TIME AS IN ONE DAY A WEEK
I WASN'T REALLY SURPRISED
AH SHE WENT STRAIGHT FOR THE THE WELSH VIEW WHICH I THOUGHT SHE WOULD
SO I ANSWERED THE QUESTION PRETTY WELL
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE
UM I USED TO CYCLE QUITE A BIT
AS A RARE SURVIVAL
WE'VE DONE TWENTY TWO MINUTES ALREADY
SO I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO TRY AND GET
THE BIG QUESTION IS TODAY
MERELY COME TO CREWKER
TO LAWRENCE'S SALEROOM TO BE WITH RICHARD KAY
AH YOU DECIDE AFTER THE SALE OF YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS
BUT FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME
I'M A BIT DISAPPOINTED BY THAT
MEANS YOU ARE PLUS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
MY NAME IS STEPHEN
AH PEOPLE CALL ME MAGIC MIKE
SO DOES EVERYBODY ELSE WHEN I'VE GOT THIS ON
I REPAIR CATERING EQUIPMENT IN HOTELS
SO THAT'S ONE GOOD THING BUT
IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT BEING THIS HANDSOME
I HESITATED WITH THE ANSWER TO CHICAGO BECAUSE I HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT
I HAVE THIS LITTLE COMPUTER IN FRONT OF ME WHICH HAS ALL THE TRAIN DETAILS AND IF ANYTHING GOES
HE LIKES US TO APOLOGISE
FORTY FIVE SOUTH WEST TRAIN SERVICE TO SOUTHAMPTON HAS BEEN DELAYED
I HAD A TERRIBLE ROUND
BUT I HAVE TO SAY TO PEOPLE AT HOME
I REALLY WASN'T EXPECTING TO
EVER SAW BUT IT WAS MADE FOR A PARTICULAR CLIENT
CRUSHING THEIR EXAMPLE
THIS IS COUNTRY TRACKS
DOING WHAT WE DO
THE JOBS THEY ALL DO
SO IF A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY COMES IN THE BACK POCKET
OR A FEW DRINKS HERE AND THERE
AND SOME TRIPS HERE AND THERE
THEN WE'RE HAPPY
BUT AGES AND AGES AGO
TIN IS IS VERY RARE INDEED
AND SO I CAME BACK A FEW YEARS AGO
I'LL BE ASKING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IT BROKE OUT AGAIN
ACCORDING TO LEGEND
HE SAW THE FAMOUS SPIDER
OUR FICTITIOUS FARMER AT THE CENTRE OF A SUSPECTED OUTBREAK
HE'S PLAYED BY AN ACTOR BUT THE WAY THE EVENTS UNFOLD IS BASED ON THE GOVERNMENT'S VERY REAL
THE FARM IS IN LEICESTERSHIRE
AND IT WAS BY THE THIRD DAY
WE DO A BIT OF DETECTIVE WORK
TO SEE WHAT COULD HAVE BROUGHT DISEASE TO THE FARM AND WHERE THAT FARM MAY HAVE SENT DISEASE IN THE PERIOD THAT
TRACEABILITY IS VITAL TO EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TRACKING WHERE ANIMALS AND DISEASE HAS SPREAD
AND CERTAINLY THE CHANGES THAT GOVERNMENT HAVE MADE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE IN THE LIGHT OF SOME OF OUR
BUT HE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO TEACH ME
BECAUSE HE SAID
WHENEVER HE DIED
THE WAY WE MAKE THEM
JOHN ASKED WHAT WE'D LEARNED FROM THE DEVASTATING OUTBREAK OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE TEN YEARS AGO
BUT HOW WOULD WE DEAL WITH IT IF THE WORST HAPPENED AND IT STRUCK AGAIN
HOPEFULLY WE'LL NEVER SEE SCENES LIKE THAT AGAIN
SOME OF THEIR CATTLE HAVE ALSO BEEN SEEN WITH SYMPTOMS OF FOOT AND MOUTH
RATHER THAN BY KILLING ANIMALS AROUND THE FARM
THERE ARE DOWNSIDES TO THAT TOO
BUT HAVE VACCINATION INSTEAD
SHOULD FOOT AND MOUTH COME BACK AGAIN
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THE LONG TERM ISSUES SURROUNDING VACCINATION
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT BARRIERS OTHER COUNTRIES WILL PUT UP ON OUR EXPORTS AND EXPORT TO OUR INDUSTRY
RURAL AFFAIRS IN GENERAL
WAS SO GREAT THAT PEOPLE DO SEE IT AS AS AS AS A SORT OF KILLER VIRUS
A FEW MONTHS AGO
ADAM STARTED THIS CRUSADE TO PUT BRITISH WORLD BACK ON THE MAP
HE WANTS TO HELP FARMERS EARN MONEY FROM SHEEP FLEECE
SYNTHETIC FIBRES TOOK THE PLACE OF WOOL IN MANY SITUATIONS
PEOPLE ARE MORE AWARE OF WHERE THEIR MATERIALS ARE COMING FROM
WOOL IS A NATURALLY RENEWABLE FIBER
WE'VE NOW GOT THE CAMPAIGN FOR WOOL
BECAUSE IT'S THE LOWER END MARKET
WE WANT TO ACTUALLY SEE THE TOP END MARKET
IF YOU LOOK AT WOOL IS A FIBRE
SIX PER CENT OF THE WORLD'S TEXTILE FIBRE MARKET
LET'S LEAVE IT THERE SHALL WE
THAT IS IT FOR THIS WEEK
THEY'VE GOT THEIR VERY OWN EXPERT WITH THEM WITH THREE HUNDRED POUNDS AND AN HOUR TO SHOP
AND IF YOU THINK THAT WAS FAST
THEY HAPPILY MARRIED AT THE MOMENT
I'M OFF SOMEWHERE REALLY RATHER EXCITING
HE TRIED TO BUY IT UNSUCCESSFULLY
PLEASE PROVE ME WRONG
SEAL EVERYTHING UP
HIS NAME WAS RICHARD DIMBLEBY
VERY FEW PEOPLE HAD
BY NATASHA WALTER
IN THE PLAY WE HEAR THE STORY OF MELTEM
MY NAME IS MELTTON
WHICH WAS WRITTEN FOR CHILDREN BUT CERTAINLY IN ITS STAGE ADAPTION MOVES
THERE WERE TWELVE OF THEM
THEY TOOK US TO THE POLICE STATION
TOLD US TO WAIT
IT HAS NO DIFFERENCE FROM A JAIL
IN THIS COUNTRY
THOUSANDS OF THEM
AND ALL OF THEM INNOCENT OF ANY CRIME
MANY OF THEM NO DOUBT PARENTS THEMSELVES
BUT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THESE VALIANT CAMPAIGNERS
ESCAPE FROM AFGHANISTAN AND MAKE THEIR WAY TO ENGLAND
WRITING THE STORY WAS MY WAY
IT MAY SEEM THAT I SEEK OUT CAUSES TO WRITE ABOUT
RATHER THEY SEEM TO SEEK ME OUT AND VERY OFTEN IT IS CHILDREN THEMSELVES
HE SAYS OF HIM I THE GREATER PART OF WRITING IS DAY DREAMING
MY FAMILY LIVES HERE IN JORDAN BUT I DO NOT BELONG HERE
I BELONG IN PALESTINE
I LOVE FINISHING IT AND THEN HOLDING THE BOOK IN MY HAND AND SHARING MY DREAM WITH MY
BUT THE COLD WAR HAD ONCE SEEMED JUST AS INTRACTABLE AS THE CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST DOES NOW
QUITE SUDDENLY IT SEEMED AT THE TIME
YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED
I KNOW THIS IS A LECTURE
NOT A STORY TELLING SESSION
WHICH IS A SHAME
MICHAEL MORPERGO IS A PHENOMENALLY SUCCESSFUL AUTHOR
A KIND OF STORY LECTURE
WEAVING OF SAD STORIES
THERE WERE RIGOROUS QUESTIONS ABOUT MY INTENTIONS IN GUARDS UM
ONLY AN HOUR BEFORE
EARLIER THAT MORNING
BEFORE I GOT THERE IT SEEMS
I WAITED IN THE HEAT FOR LONG HOURS
WATCHING THE KIDS AT WORK
HESITANTLY AT FIRST
SAW THE KIDS RUNNING TO HELP THEIR WOUNDED FRIEND
THE BOY'S TROUSERS WERE SOAKED IN IT
THE BULLETS WERE REAL
I SAW HIM CLOSE TO
FROM WHICHEVER COUNTRY
IT IS NOT CHILDREN WHO MAKE WARS
EVERY ONE OF THEM FLYING AH
WHEREVER THEY ARE
FREE FROM POVERTY
AND IT'S THIS LAST THAT BRINGS ME TO EDUCATION BY NO MEANS THE LEAST OF THE
THAT FAR TOO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN ARE FAILING
SO ARE BLAMED CONSTANTLY
TIME FOR ANOTHER STORY
IT'S ONE THAT I HEARD IN RUSSIA
IT WAS A GREAT CELEBRATORY EVENING
IT WAS A CELEBRATION OF LIBRARIANS
THE UNSUNG HEROES OF THE BOOK WORLD
THE LAST PRIZE WINNER WAS ANNOUNCED
ONE DAY HIS LIBRARY CAUGHT FIRE
WITH NO THOUGHT FOR HIS OWN SAFETY HE RUSHED INTO THE BUILDING AND
SO OFTEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IN CHILDREN'S LIVES IS NOT REFLECTED BY THEIR
WHETHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WORK IN CHILDREN'S THEATRE CHILDREN
THE LESS STATUS THERE IS FOR THOSE INVOLVED
THE TEACHING PROFESSION ITSELF IS THE MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS
SO WHAT INEVITABLY HAPPENS
LACK OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE
JUST GETTING IN WAS A NIGHTMARE
UNTIL YOU SEE THE PLACE FOR YOURSELF YOU CAN'T IMAGINE IT
EVEN IF YOU ARE WITH SAVE THE CHILDREN
THE EVENT WAS HELD
WE HAVE TO GET INVOLVED
CALL IT WHAT YOU WILL
OTHERS REMAIN MIRED IN POVERTY AND FAILURE
TAKE NEW ZEALAND
TO BE TEMPTED INTO DRUGS
BULLY A SCHOOLMATE ON THE INTERNET
IT'S A HARD LIFE
THE CHILDREN WERE ENCOURAGED TO READ STORIES ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OLD PEOPLE AND YOUNG
AND MANY HAD THANKFULLY BEEN TRANSLATED INTO FRENCH
COME AND READ TO THE CHILDREN
THEIR BODY LANGUAGE WAS AGGRESSIVE
BUT AT LEAST THEY SEEMED TO BE LISTENING
BUT IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO NOW
I WAS ON BODY SPIES
WE WENT TO ONE THE OTHER WEEK
A COUPLE OF OUR FRIENDS RAN IT
IT WAS GOOD FUN
SO WILL THE REDS BE PULLING OFF SOME IMPRESSIVE STUNTS
EXTRA WORK IN VARIOUS FILMS
AND WHEN THE WARM WEATHER COMES ALONG
THEY WANT TO FREEZE SOME ICE CREAM
THEY WANT TO COOL DOWN SOME DRINKS
UNDERGROUND AND INSULATED
YOU ARE PLUS ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE
WELL I TRAIN AND I TEACH AT THE SAME TIME
I'D LIKE TO GO TO AUSTRALIA ACTUALLY
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING IN ITS OWN RIGHT
BUT WE'RE HARDLY AT HOME
I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD BE
THAT'S HEALTH AND SAFETY
I'M HEALTHY BUT I'M NOT HEALTH AND SAFETY
I DON'T FIND HIM IRRITATING
I'M A LITTLE BIT PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT IT
WHEN I AH WHEN I CAME TO THE WEAKEST LINK
THEY DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER
IT'S A GAME AND YOU NEVER KNOW
NO YOU COULD YOU COULD BE THE BRIGHTEST PERSON AND GET VOTED OFF FOR BEING BRIGHT
AND WE'VE GOT A PRODUCT HERE
ANNE IS QUITE SCARY
THE TIME WAS ONCE WHEN THOU UN URGEST VOW THAT NEVER WORDS WERE MUSIC TO THY
WE YOU KNOW WE ALL GOT ONE WRONG
BECAUSE IN AN ACCIDENT SUCH AS MINE
YOU WOULD EXPECT ME TO HAVE DAMAGED NOT JUST HERE
BUT IT'S ALL PART OF THE SAME SYSTEM
YOU TRY AND BE BRAVE AND CHEERFUL
WHEN THE CHARITY FIRST STARTED
THAT PARALYSIS WAS PERMANENT AND MUST BE ENDURED
THANKS IN PART TO WORK FUNDED BY SPINAL RESEARCH
FOR MANY PEOPLE
REHABILITATION CAN HELP
I WRITE BOOKS PROFESSIONALLY
BOOKS ON POPULAR HISTORY
I THINK WITH THE DAMAGE THERE
COLOURS AND MOULDINGS
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY
THE STATE BED HAS BEEN RESTORED AND RETURNED
BECAUSE OF THESE ROUNDELS
I WOULD PUT PROBABLY
STAGE A FEW YEARS AGO
THAT IS MINUS EIGHTY POUND
FOR A VERY LONG TIME IF I'M CONVICTED OF THIS
IT'S HER PROTECTION AGAINST BEING STOPPED
READING THE BRIEF
THIS DEFENDANT WASN'T THERE
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG MAN
YOU'RE MY HUSBAND
IT SHOULD BE YOU THAT GOES TO PRISON FOR FOURTEEN YEARS
VERY PRECISE WAY
I LIKE A BIT OF PINEAPPLE TART MYSELF
WELL AT THE END OF THE VICTORIAN ERA AND THE EDWARDIAN ERA
THAT'S ALL RIGHT
BUT THE OUTSIDE IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
CHIPPENDALE FURNITURE AND OF COURSE THE HAND OF ROBERT ADAM IS EVERYWHERE
IF YOU CAN GET THIRTY TO FORTY
I CAN'T REALLY ACCOUNT IT TO ANY PARTICULAR OBJECT
I'M FROM CARDIFF
AND I'M A RETIRED THEATRE MANAGER
I HAVE MY FAVOURITES
THE SEASON USED TO GO
I LOOKED AFTER THEM WHEN THEY WERE THERE
WHAT'S THE MATTER
A LOT OF FLOWERING SHRUBS
SOME OF THE TIME
HE'S A POLICE OFFICER
SHE HAD ONE QUESTION WRONG
BUT THIS IS REVENGE
BECAUSE JO DID GET TWO QUESTIONS WRONG AS WELL THAT ROUND
IF THERE'S A TIE
AND THAT'S AN EXCUSE FOR HIM NOT TO PROPOSE
IT WAS SORT OF A DRAINING FEELING REALLY
BUT I MAKE SURE I SEE DEBBIE AND THE CHILDREN EVERY WEEK
WE WORK TOGETHER REALLY WELL SO WE SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT WITH EACH OTHER
SPRINGWELL COMMUNITY SCHOOL IN CHESTERFIELD
STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED INTERNALLY FROM SCHOOL AND PETE AND I HELP THEM WITH ANY
BEFORE YOU STARTED WORK AT THE CENTRE
YOU YOU CAME FROM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BACKGROUND
AND LOCAL GLASS MANUFACTURERS IN CHESTERFIELD
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT
AND I'VE BEEN DOING IT FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE
PEOPLE THOUGHT SHE WAS A DOLL
AND THEN THEY KNEW IT WAS A REAL BABY
WHAT HAPPENS IS
I THINK IT'S A VERY NICE OBJECT AND IT'S AT THAT SORT OF MONEY
BUT I LOVE THIS
NOW FOR THE BLUES
DEBBIE AND MARGARET
FIVE EIGHTS ARE FORTY
THEIR FIRST ITEM
ANYBODY IN THE ROOM
TWENTY NINE BEATS THEM ALL
WHICH MEANS OVERALL
IT WAS A VERY DANGEROUS JOB
ALL OF THIS REMINDS ME OF THAT GORGEOUS FRENCH FILM AMILE
WHEN THE HEROINE SENDS HER FATHER'S GARDEN GNOME ON A ROUND THE WORLD TRIP
THREE MEN IN NEW YORK WERE ARRESTED FOR POSSESSION OF FOURTEEN GARDEN GNOMES
AND THEN TWO YEARS LATER
SWIMMING IN BANGKOK
A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER
THEY RECEIVED A POSTCARD FROM SAIDOME HOLIDAYING IN QUEENSLAND
KNOW I'M INSTANTLY RECOGNIZABLE WHEREVER I GO
BROWN SHOE POLISH SUNTAN
AND THE CRIME OF NO NAPPING WAS BORN
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE A GO AT PAINTING WITH IT
FIRE AND WATER ARE THE SORT OF THREE FUNDAMENTALS
THIS IS THE FUN PART
AND INSIDE THE WATER
DO WE REALLY NEED TO LEARN SURVIVAL SKILLS
FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS
THE SECRET OF MANAGING THE WILD BOAR KEEP THEM IN THE WOODLERS
KEEP THEM AWAY FROM AGRICULTURE
WE WOULD CALL THEM
BUT WE WOULD BE VERY SELECTIVE IN THE ANIMALS THAT WE CALL
IT WOULDN'T BE INDISCRIMINATE
IT'S A FACTUAL THING
WHILE I DO THAT
PICNICS BY THE RIVER IN THE SUMMER
I'LL BE INVESTIGATING
AND IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT THIS HOUSE IS ALSO CALLED AMBRIDGE
BUT THE GAP BETWEEN EARNINGS AND PROPERTY PRICES IN THE UK IS NOW BIGGER THAN EVER
FORCING LOCAL PEOPLE OUT
JOHN HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING THE COST OF A PLACE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
TOGETHER WITH MANY MORE
THE TROUBLE IS THAT INCOMES HAVEN'T INCREASED AT THE SAME RATE
DOVEDALE COTTAGE IS ON THE MARKET FOR ONE
BUT I JUST FEEL FOR PEOPLE LIKE US WHO WORK REALLY HARD AND SAVE OUR PENNIES
AH PRICES THAT START AT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN
THINGS HAVE REALLY GONE FROM BAD TO WORSE IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY
THE AVERAGE HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT TEN TIMES AVERAGE INCOME HERE
I WAS JUST TALKING TO A LOCAL RESIDENT
AND WE WANT TO MOVE ON IN LIFE
SO BY THE END OF THE DAY
SO IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
PEOPLE BORN IN RURAL AREAS ARE BEING FORCED OUT
SO WHAT'S BEING DONE TO HELP THEM
AND WE WANT TO MOVE ON IN LIFE
THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS TENS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS IN ENGLAND ALONE
TRYING TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF BOVINE TB
HIS RARE BREED CATTLE HAS TESTED POSITIVE AGAIN
IF EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN
YOUR GRANDSON WAS OUTSIDE
NEXT WEEK I SHALL BE SAILING A CELEBRATED BARGE UP THE THAMESESTARY
YOU WILL BE FORGIVEN IF YOU HAVE NO TALENT
NEVER FORGIVEN IF YOU FORGET YOUR PEN
I NEVER FEED WITH PLANTS
THEY'LL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER
FROM DUNDEE AND I'M A GAS SERVICE TECHNICIAN
FROM BIRKENSHARE IN BRADFORD AND I'M AN IT MANAGER
I'M EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
I REALLY LOVE LANGUAGES AND I LOVE PEOPLE
SO I TEND TO PEOPLE WATCH
CAPWEA IS AN AFRICAN BRAZILIAN ART IT'S A MARTIAL ART
SILLY LITTLE THINGS
MY MIND WENT COMPLETELY BLANK
WITH THE NERVES
VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND PITTED AGAINST THE OTHER CONTESTANTS LIKE
I THINK SHE'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE THE PRIZE FUND AT THE END
WHEN YOU'RE THE LAST THREE
WHY WOULD I MAKE IT UP
I'M FROM BEVERLEY IN EAST YORKSHIRE
WE WORK TOGETHER
SO ARE YOU NOT SUCH A FAN OF THE STAGE THEN
THEY'RE NOT REALLY VERY KEEN ON SPENDING MUCH MONEY
SO DEPENDING ON HOW THE BRETBY POT GETS ON
THEY MAY NEED THE BONUS BUY
IT'S EIGHTEEN CARAT GOLD
SO AGAIN QUALITY
BUT IT'S A NICE
BUT I CAN'T TALK
BECAUSE MY CO COMPETITORS HAVE BEEN GOING FOR THREE DAYS
I CAN PROVE THAT I MADE IT TO THE TOP
BECAUSE HE FIGURED THAT STAMP COLLECTORS WOULD PAY A SMALL FORTUNE FOR A LETTER THAT HAD BEEN DELIVERED
SEND THE ROCK OVER
THE NAZIS HAD BEEN AT WORK ON A TOP SECRET ROCKET PROGRAMME THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY DELIVER THE
LIKE A COTTAGE INDUSTRY
EVEN THE THE WOOL HAS TO BE SPUN AND DYED ON THE ISLAND
WE'VE GOT VHF RADIOS
I HAVEN'T BEEN IN A KAYAK SINCE I SPENT FORTY DAYS IN ONE CONSECUTIVELY
BUT THAT WAS MONTHS AGO
WHILE I GET READY
LITTER LOUTS AND FLY TIPERS AREPOING MUCH OF OUR BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE
SO MUCH SO THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
BUT IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK
NONE OTHER THAN CHARLES DICKENS AND
IT'S A HAVEN FOR WILD BIRDS
THE BIGGEST HERONRY IN THE COUNTRY
I MEAN HOW ARE THEY DOING
HIS OWN PRIVATE LITTLE WRITING STUDIO
AND HERE IT WAS
THAT HE WROTE MANY OF HIS GREATEST WORKS
YEAH JOHN WAS INVESTIGATING THE IMPACT OF LITTER ON THE COUNTRYSIDE
BUT WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS BLOT ON THE LANDSCAPE
WELL WE'VE GOT SOME IDEAS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE
BUT THERE IS A GREAT SOURCE OF FRESH FOOD RIGHT HERE ON LONDON'S DOORSTEP THAT'S OFTEN FORGOTTEN
HE WAS THE SORT OF PRINCE OF DUSTMEN IN LONDON
WE QUITE LIKE A BIT OF SILVER
NOW FOR THE BLUES
I'M A SUPPLY TEACHER
FROM SOUTH LONDON
I FROM BRACKEN IN MID WALES AND
THEY HAVE TO BE INTERESTED DINNER AND
FANTASTICALLY SEXY LOVER
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY BE QUITE WITTY AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TO SPEAK BACK
I PROMISED MY DAUGHTER THAT I WOULD
AND I THINK PEOPLE REMEMBER THE PASS MORE THAN IF YOU ATTEMPT THE QUESTION
AND SO I WAR
DAVID CAMERON MAY BE PRIME MINISTER
I REALLY WANT TO HELP YOU
HE GOT BACK TO A NORMAL LIFE
I KNEW WHAT IT WAS
WORD WOULD GET OUT
AND WE'VE ONLY GOT SIXTY MINUTES TO FIND THEM
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND
SO WE ACTUALLY LOST MONEY
I KNOW YOU SAID THERE WASN'T MUCH
BUT IF IT CAME PUSH TO SHOVE AND THE HEAVENS OPEN
BECAUSE OF COURSE THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
NOT TO MY TASTE
BUT THEY ARE ANTIQUES
THEY COST ME THIRTY FIVE
WHAT DID YOU SPEND IT ON
I LIKE TO SPEND THE MONEY IF I'M GIVEN IT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE RIGHT NOW
BUT FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME
GOOD DECORATIVE OBJECTS
DO I SEE FIVE ANYWHERE
AND IT CAN BE EITHER AN INTRINSIC AND NATURAL HEALTH BENEFIT
WE MIGHT HAVE BUTTERMILK
RAW COMMODITY PRODUCT LIKE MILK
SO TALKING ABOUT HEALTH AND FITNESS
UM WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY NICE
WHAT WAS DRIVING THE MARKET SO FAST BUT FOR A SECOND BRAND
SAT DOWN AND HAD TOGETHER
LOWER FAT PRODUCT AND
AND THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE WORD SHAPE AND THE BRAND SHAPE
AND THAT REPRESENTS THE NEXT GENERATION
THE NEXT PHASE OF THE YOGURT MARKET
PRETTY BLAND PRODUCTS THAT THEY HAD NO FUTURE
AND SO THAT WAS THE SPARK
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT
BUT THERE WERE EXTRA COSTS INVOLVED AND THE SUCCESS OF BRANDS IS TO PRICE AT THE
SO THAT WAS WHAT REALLY GAVE RISE
THERE'S REALLY NO LIMIT
TO MY KNOWLEDGE
WAS IT SOME PROBLEM OF THE GUT
WHAT YAKULT DID IN PERSUADING PEOPLE THAT THEY NEEDED THIS THING IN THEIR LIVES
CONSUMERS WOULD NOT COME BACK TO PROBIOTIC DRINKS IF THEY DIDN'T FEEL AND SENSE SOME BENEFIT
SO THERE IS NO POINT IN PAYING A PREMIUM FOR A PRODUCT EVERY DAY WHEN YOU DON'T
AND SO A LOT OF CONSUMERS WILL SAY
SO IT WAS NOT A QUICK FIX
FOR ANY TYPE OF OF TARGET GROUP
NO MARGIN TO ROUGHLY NINE PERCENT MARGIN TO PERHAPS FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN PERCENT MARGIN ON
JUST A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THAT
AND IF THE BENEFIT IS THERE THEN IT'S REFLECTED IN CONTINUING DAILY USE
FOR THE COMPANY
THERE IS A BOND OF LOYALTY THAT CAN'T BE EQUALLED IN ANY OTHER WAY
THEY DON'T REPLACE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE SHOPPING BASKET
WE WOULD LOVE TO BELIEVE THAT WE COULD EAT AND DRINK WHATEVER WE LIKED IN WHATEVER QUANTITIES
OR BETTER STILL
A NICE TASTING FOOD PRODUCT
IT BECOMES VERY CONFUSING
AND AGAIN IT CREATES THE IDEA THAT UM NUTRITION IS A DEEPLY
SO I DON'T KNOW WHY AN APPLE IS NOT A FUNCTIONAL FOOD
THEY BUY THE PRODUCT AND TRY THEM AND THEN THEY STICK WITH THE ONE THAT THEY FIND ACTUALLY SEEMS
YOU'RE TRYING TO JUDGE US BY THE STANDARDS OF THE DRUG INDUSTRY
WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND
TO PLAY THE GAME
HEALTH DOES NOT COME AS THE FIRST REASON WHEN THEY SAY
WHICH THEY ARE WORRIED THEY MAY NOT
OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS
AND WHILE IT'S A GOOD THING THAT HEALTH CLAIMS SHOULD BE APPROVED BEFORE THEY'RE USED IN THE MARKET
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BEGIN TO COMMUNICATE WHAT YOUR BENEFIT IS
SO THE IRONY IS THAT THE HEALTH CLAIMS REGIME WILL JUST REINFORCE THE POSITION OF THE EXISTING
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT WE NOW HAVE A HEALTH CLAIM SYSTEM THAT IS MORE DEMANDING THAN
MORE NUTRITIOUS CHOICES IN WHAT THEY DO
WHETHER THAT'S THE FACT THAT THEY'RE HAVING TO HAVE QUICKER MEALS BECAUSE THE PACE OF LIFE HAS GOT
THE UNHEALTHY CRISP WITH THE PLEASURE BUT JUST HAVE IT LESS
THE BULK OF OUR GROWTH IS GOING TO COME FROM HEALTHIER PRODUCTS BY THE END OF THIS DECADE AND AND SO
CERTAINLY ALTHOUGH IT'S STILL ONLY TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WHO MAKE POSITIVE HEALTHY CHOICES
WILL WE BE AS HEALTHY AS WE WANT TO BE
WILL WE BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT WE WANT
NOBODY IS PUTTING THOSE FEARS INTO US
ONE OF THE BIG THINGS WITH FOOD IS THAT
IS THAT IN THE WEST WE'VE GOT MORE THAN WE NEED
THAT'S HOW CAPITALISM WORKS
OVER THE CENTURIES
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR BIGGEST NIGHTMARE IF YOU WERE AN EDWARDIAN HOSTESS AND
OUT THERE IN THE FAIR
SHE DOESN'T LIKE
THEY LOVE CERAMICS AND WE FAILED TO FIND ANYTHING
I'M FROM WOMBWELL
SOME PEOPLE CHARGE A FEE AND SOME PEOPLE
I CAME TO ENJOY IT
AND YOU'RE THE STRONGEST LINK
IT FELT WONDERFUL
TO THINK THAT I'D ACTUALLY GOT THROUGH THE WHOLE SHOW AND I'D MANAGED TO WIN THE MONEY AND COME
THE WILDLIFE TRUST
AND SO IT TAKES A LOT OF SEARCHING
UM JUST UNDER WAY I CAN SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THE ELBE IN ACTION
IS THAT THE WAY IT'S ALWAYS GOT TO BE
SO THEY'RE THEY'RE OUR MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE
LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY
IT WOULD HAVE AN ENDURANCE OF ABOUT TWENTY ONE
OR A CLEAVING AXE
ESPECIALLY ON THESE PREMISES
THEY HAD PLACES IN LONDON ALL THROUGH THEIR LIVES AS
WHEN IT FIRST STARTED
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO DO
WHAT IS THE TASK AHEAD
WIDE OPEN FIELDS
BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT CUTBACKS
RURAL SERVICES ARE BEING AXED RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE
THAT'S WHAT I'LL BE INVESTIGATING
I THINK THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY DO SO WELL IN THE WILD NOW
AND ONE WHICH CONTAINED THE SMALLER REMAINS
AND ONE FROM BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED
IT CAN HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT
JOHN HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING
SOME COUNCILS ARE MAKING NO CUTS IN BUS SERVICES
AND OTHERS ARE CUTTING DEEPLY
IT'S ONE OF HORSE RIDING'S LESSER KNOWN COMPETITION EVENTS
BUT SINCE LE TREC WAS INTRODUCED TO BRITAIN ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO IT'S BEEN ATTRACTING A GROWING
HE WAS ALMOST ASLEEP
SECOND PHASE BEING PTV
WHICH IS AN OBSTACLE COURSE
THEY'VE GOT IT WRONG
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR SHOWING ME A BIT MORE ABOUT A SPORT THAT I'D NEVER REALLY HEARD OF BEFORE
JOHN REPORTED ON HUGE CUTS IN TRANSPORT SERVICES WHICH ARE LEAVING PEOPLE INCREASINGLY ISOLATED
THAT'S THE MAIN SPORT
LIKE BORO NEEDING TO GET TO THE BEACH
ADAM TRAVELLED TO A TO BUY A NEW HIGHLAND BULL
BUT THE POINT IS YOU GET SMALL HORSES
YOU WORK THEM AS A PAIR
ANYTHING TO KEEP THE RIFF RAFF OUT
THEY EVEN BANNED THE SALE OF ICE CREAMS ALONG THE SEAFRONT
IT'S VERY SMALL
IT'S A BIT ROUGH ROUND THE EDGES
IT'S NOT QUITE THE COSTA DEL SO BUT
AND NEXT WEEK I'M GOING TO BE EXPLORING A RESERVOIR WITH A BIT OF A HISTORY AND
THEN I GRADUATED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND'VE BEEN DANCING EVER SINCE REALLY
AFTER DECADES OF NEGLECT
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
THAT WOULD BE A BRILLIANT START
I THOUGHT FANTASTIC
BUT SOMEBODY MIGHT FANCY IT VERY STRONGLY
WE SELL SILVER VERY WELL HERE
AT THE END OF THE DAY
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THEIR BONUS BUY
FIRST UP FOR OUR TEAMS
SHE DID SUCH A NUMBER CONVINCING THE DOCTORS SHE HAD APPENDICITIS
I SPOKE TO THE PARAMEDIC WHO ATTENDED AT THE HOUSE
IF I FIND HIM MYSELF
MINE SAYS I'M GOING TO HAVE A DAY FULL OF THRILLS AND EXCITEMENT
SO WE WANT TO GO TO FRANCE
I WON'T NAME THEM
ON THE BACK SIDE
OUT OF THE ORDINARY
AND THAT'S PERFECT FOR ME
SO YOU TWO ARE GOOD FRIENDS
WE WANT SOMETHING MORE EXPENSIVE
I IT'S IT'S THE END OF THE DAY
FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME
MUM IS THE WORD
AH WHERE I WANTED TO SCREAM
BUT IF I SCREAMED
SOMEWHERE WE CAN SIT AND BE TOGETHER
SEE IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING BIGGER
LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS
WHICH DO YOU WANT TO DO NO
SO THE HEART CONDITION WAS FAR MORE OF A PROBLEM
HE'S JUST BEEN BORN
AND HE IS GOING
HE JUST WANTS TO GET ON WITH IT
SHE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE
AND THINK SHE TAKES ON TOO MUCH
HE LOVES JAMES BOND
NOT EVERYBODY HAS THEIR MOTHER HOLDING THEIR HANDS
AND I THINK I WAS JUST ABOUT AT THE END OF MYSELF
CHILLY OUT HERE TODAY
WHAT YOU WANT IS FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF WARM FRONTAGE AND A SUNNY DISPOSITION
WE MET ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO
JUST OFF CARNABY STREET
IN A PIECE OF RUSTIC FURNITURE
IT'S MARKED UP AT FIFTY NINE
IF YOU FELT ROUND THE RIB
PORPHYRY IS AN EXOTIC AND RARE MINERAL
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS
HALF THE STUFF WAS BEING BLOWN UP
WELL WE'LL SOON FIND OUT
YOU ARE PLUS FIVE
I'LL BE LOOKING BACK AT THE BEST OF THE BBC'S RURAL PROGRAMS FROM THIS PART OF THE WORLD
SEVEN NAUTICAL MILES IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN A SINGLE RUN
THE DISASTER MADE HEADLINES AROUND THE WORLD
MOST OF THE CREW WERE FROM HERE
OFFICES OF WHITE STAR LINE
THERE WAS A BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH ONE OF THE SHIPS
JUST HALF A MILE FROM WHERE WE'RE STANDING NOW
THE TWO FACTORIES OF SUPERMARINE AT SOUTHAMPTON
ARRIVED IN WINCHESTER FOR A SHORT STAY AND WAS SO INSPIRED BY THE CITY'S BEAUTY THAT HE PENNED ONE
AND THIS IS WHERE WE THINK THERE'S THE VERY
IT'S MORE THAN ONE PART
AND THE PARTS ARE VERY EQUALLY SPACED AND THEY INTERWEAVE THEIR OWN MELODIES
I IT SEEMS SO INTUITIVE TO US
WITH THE FEED INDUSTRY
I BEGAN TO FEEL ILL WITH THE DUST AND AMMONIA
THEY WERE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY PUT US IN CONTACT WITH ANOTHER FAMILY WHO HAD BEEN THROUGH WHAT WE
THANKS IN PART TO RESEARCH FUNDED BY THE CHARITY
IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES
LONDON IS IN A FLOOD PLAININ
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T STOP ENTIRELY
AND THAT THERE'S A BENEFIT TO THEM
THEY SHOULD BE PAYING LESS IN INSURANCE
AND THAT'S PART OF THE POLICIES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROMOTE
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THE NEXT TALLEST TREE BEING AMONGST US HERE
FOR A WELSH CHAMPION
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT COVERING THE MILES THERE IS YOU KNOW AN AWFUL LOT
THIS PART OF THE WORLD REALLY DOES HAVE SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY
YET ALL AROUND ME
ANYTHING FROM FIVE
THOUSAND POUND DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF OPENINGS
AND THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
THAT NEED TO HAPPEN
AIR BRI COVERS NEED TO BE INSTALLED
SEALANT AROUND ANY PIPES THAT COME THROUGH THE WALLS
THE AVERAGE DAMAGE TO A PROPERTY IS ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND
LIKE MANY PEOPLE ROUND HERE
SHE NEVER REALLY LOOKED BACK
WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSERVATION HABITAT ON THE FARM
FIRST HAS SPRING REALLY SPRUNG
I'M TALKING ABOUT WHILE THEY WERE STILL HERE
THERE'S NO ALIBI WORTH THE NAME
YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IS IN MY HANDS
DAVID DREW WASN'T THERE IN APRIL EIGHTY SIX
DON'T GET ME WRONG
AFTER THIRTY TWO MINUTES WE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST HAD TWO OR THREE THINGS IN MIND EVEN IF WE HAVEN'T BOUGHT
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
PLUS THE TEN YOU HAD BEFORE
SO OVERALL YOU'RE MINUS FIVE
THEN THE EYES WOULD SEE AND THEY WOULD KNOW
I SUSPECT WE'VE GOT TO BE REALLY CAUTIOUS HERE
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
THAT IS UNTIL YOU START TAKING IT APART
BUT THEY MAY NOT GO WITH IT
THAT'S THE JOY OF THE GAME
TONY CAME IN JUST A MOMENT LATER
ONE OF THE PHOTOS ON THE WEBPAGE
THEY CAME TO MY FLAT AND BROKE A WINDOW
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW RAP SONGS
IT STARTED TO AFFECT THINGS
THE ONE THAT SPRINGS TO MIND WAS ON HOLIDAY
NOT ALWAYS VERY WELL
BECAUSE COMING DOWN THE SLOPE
THE TEAM WINS THAT MAKES THE MOST PROFIT AT AUCTION
I SHOULD JOLLY WELL HOPE SO
MAYBE A PIECE OF
I'M A LIFE COACH AND I DO A BIT OF WRITING
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO VERY WELL
THE BONUS BUY CAN ADD TO THEIR PROFITS OR
I'M HEADING OFF SOMEWHERE SPLENDID
IT'S NOT VERY FAR AWAY FROM HERE
LIKE AN AIR FRESHENER
EVEN IN POLITE SOCIETY
IF YOU HAD A BRE PARFU LIKE THIS THAT WOULD GIVE OFF NICE
THE LINES ON THE TEAPOT
MY NAME IS SUSANNE
BUT IT WAS FAIR VOTING AND I'M OFF
IN MY OWN LITTLE WORLD
BECAUSE SHE IS NEARLY SEVENTY AND THAT PROBABLY TOUCHED A RAW NERVE
BUT I THINK IT'S FUN
I WASN'T GOING TO BE UPSET BY IT
I'D HAVE GOT NOTHING RIGHT
I THINK IF I TOOK
IF I WAS IN A HOUSE I WOULD SEE THAT
CAN WE MAKE ONE HUNDRED
FIFTY ANYWHERE ELSE NOW
GOING THEN AT TWENTY EIGHT
IT'S NO YOLK AT THIS PRICE
THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE
SIXTY FIVE ON THE INTERNET
I'VE GOT FORTY FIVE AS A COMMISSION BID
IT'S THE LAST CALL THEN
I HAVE TO SAY I PUT MY HAND IN MY BACK POCKET AND I'VE ACQUIRED THEM
ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY OF THESE THINGS
THE LIGHTER AND CIGARETTE PEOPLE
I KNOW THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING
IT'S A DUNHILL PRODUCT
IT'S VERY COLLECTABLE AS A LIGHTER
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
EIGHT YEARS AGO
FOR THE FOR THE SORT OF MEATS WHERE YOU NEED MARBLING
WONDERFUL TEXTURE AND YOU'VE GOT IT
PERCENT THIS IS LIKE VIDEO
I BELIEVE IN YOU KNOW ONE DAY BEING ABLE TO YOU KNOW HAVE MY OWN YACHT WITH MY NAME ON IT
WHEN THEY DO THAT
THIS IS THE WIFE
I SEE THE SAME HOLE
AND SHE WANTED TO PUT TWO PIECES OF PLASTIC IN HER BUM FOR SEVEN GRAND
I WOULDN'T WEAR THAT
WHAT CAN YOU COMMAND
AND THOUSAND JUST TO SHOW UP FOR SOMETHING
I'M YOUR GRANDDAD
THE GOOD OLD NHS'LL FIX YOU UP
BE FOREVER IN MY DEBT
IT'S BEEN PRODUCING LOCAL ALE SINCE AT LEAST SIXTEEN FORTY TWO
THERE ARE SIXTY FIVE PERCENT LESS PEOPLE PER SQUARE MILE HERE THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT'S LARGELY
FARMERS ARE HANGING ON IN THERE
AND NEXT CURRENT COUNT
I'M A VERY KEEN GOLFER
IT'S A REAL SHAME ABOUT THE LAND
THERE'S NO LAND
THIS IS EVERYTHING THEY WANT AND A LOT MORE
WE HAVE CHILDREN
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF SHOPPING FOR PROPERTY IN THE COUNTRY
DID WE JUST DO IT
CONTROLS THE SPACE
AND THEN I HAVE TO DRAG HER
SCREAMING AND KICKING
ARE MORE ASSOCIATED WITH DOMESTIC
IF HE WANTS SOMETHING DONE
SHE DOESN'T GO OUTSIDE AND ARRANGE HIS TOOLS
YOU CAN THEN SAY
SPACE TO GROW THINGS
TRY IT ON SYRIA
THAT'S A GOOD START
UNTIL NEXT TIME
AND NOW WE PICK UP THAT THEME AS OUR CHOIR SINGS THIS JOYFUL
GLORY AND MIGHT
I TRULY UNDERSTAND THAT GOD SHOWS NO PARTIALITY
WHILE IT WAS STILL DARK
THEY HAVE TAKEN AWAY MY LORD
WHY ARE YOU WEEPING
DO NOT HOLD ON TO ME
BUT GO TO MY BROTHERS AND SAY TO THEM
I'VE NEVER TRIED TO REPLACE YOUR MUM
I'M MORE LIKE A BIG SISTER
I'M NOT TRYING TO REPLACE YOUR DAD
YOU JUST WATCH ME
THAT'S STILL ROUGHLY TWELVE YEARS EACH
WHEN IT COMES TO NOT EXPRESSING YOUR TRUE FEELINGS
LEAVING IT SOMEWHERE
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT
WHY YOU COVER FOR HIM
NOT EVERYONE CAN BE LIKE YOU
BEING FROM WALES
HAS ALWAYS BEEN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME
BUT EVERYWHERE I'VE GONE
YOU CAN MAKE A BATCH OF WELSH CAKES
YOU CAN FIND A BIT OF LAMB AND COOKED IT LIKE YOUR GRANDMA COOKED IT
EVERYBODY CAME IN THE KITCHEN
THAN ON A CRICKET PITCH
I MEAN IT'S KIND OF
SHARING A TASTE OF HOME WITH EACH OTHER
THERE'S A SCOUT FROM MU UNITED WATCHING YOU TODAY
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY FOOTBALL FOR LUNCH NIGHT WHEN YOU LEAVE SCHOOL
VERY FEW WOMEN KNEW VERY MUCH ABOUT FOOTBALL
FOR WANT OF A BETTER EXPRESSION
THERE ARE SOME SURVIVORS
IF THAT WOMAN HAD COME FIVE MINUTES EARLIER
THE MANCHESTER UNITED TRAINER
NOT NECESSARILY TO PLAY FOOTBALL
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY BORING FOOTBALL
YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT TO ENTERTAIN
SLIPS OFF THE TONGUE YOU KNOW
BY HIS GOALS AND
THAT'S A GOOD DEAL
THAT JUST AGAIN SHOWS HIS CHARACTER AND HIS PERSONALITY
ONE OF OUR GREAT PLAYERS
OUR LIVES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
BUT YOU I WAS VERY CLOSE
OF COURSE I SAW IT EXACTLY
THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT BECAME THE STANDARD THEN
NOW ALEX ALEX WANTS DOING IT ALL THE TIME
WHAT HAVE YOU COME FOR
WHAT WERE THEY LIKE
WAS RECOMMENDED TO FANE BY HIS NEIGHBOUR
WHO FUNDAMENTALLY SAID LOOK
BUT THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE AND
ENOUGH OF THE LAYOUT
BUT EVERYBODY WAS COMING HERE TO TAKE INSPIRATION AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
THEY WANT SOME OF THAT MAGIC
AND HE POURED HIS WEALTH AND HIS AMBITION AND
BUT IN FACT IN FIFTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
THEY'RE LAID OUT
THEY'RE IMPOSED ON THE LANDSCAPE
WATER IS BROUGHT IN BY AQUEDUCTS
YOU CAN BE MARRIED AND YOU LOVE YOUR WIFE
BUT YOU CAN HAVE LOTS OF LOVERS
TRYING TO INTERPRET THE WHOLE THING IN THAT WAY
FROM THE OUTSIDE
YOU SEE PHOTOGRAPHS
IF I GO TO PRISON
OR SOME OTHER CRIME
WHAT DO THEY DO WITH IT ALL ANYWAY
WHEN KATY'S NOT LOOKING
I'VE GOT LOADS OF FRIENDS
I APPRECIATE YOU COMING ALONG THOUGH
EVER SINCE WE MET THE WEAVERS
ONLINE DEAL YOU'LL NEVER GUESS HOW MUCH
ACCORDING TO THIS LEAFLET
SPACIOUS FOUR BED SEMI WITH EXECUTIVE GARDEN OFFICE
I'M OVER I'M JUST REALLY PROTECTIVE OVER HIM
THAT EXPRESSED POWER AND PLEASURE AS WELL AS JUST UTILITARIANISM
BECAUSE IT MEANT THAT YOU HAD LOTS OF MONEY TO SPEND
AH PINSENT TOLD ME
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FLOWERS
HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH EXPERIENCE
HE'S COMING FROM A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TRADITION
FOR THE LIE OF THE LAND ITSELF
I THINK IT'S SO SUCCESSFUL AS A GARDEN
SO THE DI JOIN WORKED
I WAS IN A HURRY
WE HAVE A SACRED DUTY OF CARE
I WILL FINISH MY SHIFT
IF I DON'T OPERATE ON YOU RIGHT NOW
HAVING MR HANSON LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER
YOU ABUSED A POSITION OF POWER
HE'S NOT KNOWN TO ALL PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY
AND I FEEL THAT IF WE CAN CRACK THAT
IT'S JUST A COPY
BUT IT'S NOT ALL BAD
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE IS THE NATIONAL RECORDS OFFICE IN TOWN
AS THIS WAS IN IRELAND
IF YOU DO THAT WITH NO DISHONESTY
KNOWINGLY THROWN IT AWAY
TO ILLUSTRATE AN ARTICLE WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO GET WEALTHY AMERICANS TO GO TO THE ISLANDS IN THE
WHO WAS A TALENTED AMATEUR PAINTER
WE'VE PLACED A VALUE OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND
REALLY EITHER WITHDRAW IT FROM SALE AND SOTHEBY'S KEEP OWNERSHIP OF IT TILL I GET A LAWYER AND
AND I'M NOW JUST SPEAKING PURELY FROM A PROFESSIONAL POINT OF VIEW
WE SPOKE TO IONA MURRAY
WHO LIVES AT MYRTLE GROVE
THIS PAINTING IS MINE
HE'S OVER HERE IN AMERICA
IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS A VALUABLE PICTURE
WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY OTHER VALUABLE PICTURES
I SEE IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH TODAY
THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE NUMBERS
THEY DIDN'T WORK
AND THE FIRST THING SHE KNEW ABOUT IT WAS WHEN IT APPEARED IN THE TELEGRAPH
IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE CELL TO PROCEED
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HORRIFYING FOR HER AND
I WAS FORMERLY A CRIMINAL BARRISTER
IT MUST BE HORRIBLE
WHY DON'T YOU WANT THE THE MEMORY OF THE THE THREE ANCESTORS
BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A SPECIAL PICTURE
A STORY LIKE THAT
THE PAINTING WOULD HAVE BEEN RUINED
THAT'S WHAT AGENCY NURSES DO
WHEN WE VALUE ARTISTUTIC NOVELTY AND ORIGINALITY
SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT HOME
POORLY MAINTAINED PATIENT HYGIENE
I WON'T HAVE JUNIOR DOCTORS
WANTED TO RUN AWAY FROM HER
NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THAT BEFORE
JUST ONE OR TWO
MEAN YOU'RE NOT JOINED AT THE HIP
REDECORATED AND REFURNISHED OVER THE YEARS
AND THE PART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY VITAL
EXCITING PLACE TO BE
BUILDINGS TEEMING WITH LIFE
HORSES AND CARTS EVERYWHERE
INDUSTRY IS ALL ABOUT PROGRESS
AND PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
AND THERE'S CEMENT HERE GOING FROM EARLY CEMENTS RIGHT THROUGH TO MODERN CEMENT
AND HE RANG US UP ONE DAY
OVER ALL THOSE POTHOLES
YOU SEE HE WAS A WIDOWER AT THE AGE OF SIXTY AND WITHOUT AN HEIR
WHICH HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE THIS VERSION
THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD STILL FLYING
ONCE THE TANNOY WENT
I THINK YOU'LL BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH THE SKILL
I LOOK LIKE AN OUTRAGE
AND ITS ASTONISHING ENGINEERING
TO THE TIME OF HIS DEATH IN NINETEEN HUNDRED
CRAGSIDE IS IN A REMOTE LOCATION
WE'VE GOT JELLY MOOLD
ARMSTRONG AND ALL THE STAFF THAT LIVED AND WORKED HERE ARE ONE OF MANY SUCCESS STORIES THROUGHOUT BRITAIN DURING THE
WHICH IS ABOUT TO HAVE ITS FIRST INMATE FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS ME
BUT WHAT ACTUALLY TURNED OUT
LET'S TRY REFORMING
BUT I THINK IT'S BEEN IMPORTANT THAT I CAME AND SPENT SOME TIME HERE AND SPENT THE NIGHT
AND BRUSH UNDER THE CARPET THE DARKER AND MORE SINISTER SIDES
AND THAT IS CERTAINLY WHAT LINCOLN CASTLE PRISON
HE WANTED TO FISH THE WATER
OR MASSIVE CONCRETE BUILDINGS
OUR REPORTERS HAVE BEEN TOURING THE BRITISH ISLES IN SEARCH OF THE OVERLOOKED
AND IN HER QUEST FOR HIDDEN HERITAGE
CLARE BALDING HAS BEEN TO ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO FIND A LONG FORGOTTEN
THE COLOUR OF IT
THE DEEPER YOU DIG
BUT WHAT DID HE USE IT FOR IN THE HOUSE
NO ONE HAD THOUGHT ABOUT THIS
IT WOULD BE LIKE SEEING A MAGIC SHOW
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE WHOLE HOUSE WORK
IT'S OUT THERE UNDER THE SEA
FINDING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
DOWN IN THE COMMENT TOWER
IT IT TOOK A LOT OF NERVE
BUT SHE WAS RAISED
A MAN KNOWN FOR HIS PASSION OF ALL THINGS MODERN
AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS
AS A CLEAN SOURCE OF POWER AND ENERGY
AND ALWAYS TRYING TO LIGHTEN THE LOAD FOR THE WORKMAN WITH HIS INVENTIONS
YOU'RE NEVER TOO FAR AWAY FROM SOMEWHERE THAT'S GOING TO REMIND YOU OF THIS REMARKABLE LEGACY
NOW MUCH OF IT WE ALREADY KNOW
NESTLED IN THE NORTHAMPTONSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE LIES AN EXCEPTIONAL ARCHITECTURAL DELIGHT
AND AT FIRST SIGHT
IF YOU COME TO BA
LOCKED IN THE ATTIC
AND THE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE COME AS WELL
IF YOU HAD A CARRIAGE
IT'S SOLD MILLIONS OF COPIES ALL OVER THE WORLD
I AM OFFICIALLY INTRIGUED
THE PASSAGE ON JANE EYRE'S FIRST APPROACH
WE NEED MORE ABOUT THE HOUSE
WE DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS A SERVANT OR WHETHER WHETHER SHE WAS A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
I MEAN IT'S VERY SMALL
IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO BE AFRAID OF
AND THE ENGLISH ARISTOCRACY WERE SENDING AGENTS OVER THERE TO BUY IT UP ON THE CHEAP AND BRING IT
WE'RE NOT ALWAYS THAT KEEN TO PRESERVE IT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN FIVE OF THESE WATER WHEELS TUMBLING DOWN THIS VALLEY
I DO KNOW THAT THIS PLACE DIDN'T CHANGE THE WORLD LIKE CROMFORD
MODERN INDUSTRIAL PROCESS WAS BORN
BUT I SUSPECT IT WAS VERY CLOSE
CAVALIERS ROAMING THE COUNTRYSIDE TRYING TO GET AWAY
CROMWELL'S FORCES TRYING TO HUNT THEM DOWN
HE WAS IN FEAR OF HIS LIFE
HE WOULD'VE BEEN BEHEADED
AND AND THE WHOLE FRENCH CULTURE
AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
THE MORE REWARDING THE TREASURE IS
AND WITH THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF HISTORY UNDER OUR BELTS
SO WHAT BETTER PLACE
WE'RE DEPENDENT ON THE GIFT OF THE WEATHER
AND THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING BETTER TO DO
CON MYSELF THINK
HERE IN PERSH THEY PREFER THE COLOUR PURPLE
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS HERE IN PERSHORE
JOY THAT WE'VE GOT FOOD IN THE BARN
IF WE'VE GOT THE FOOD IN THE BARN
IT'S TEN DAYS SINCE THE TAMARINS WERE BORN SO IT'S TIME TO CATCH UP SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING
TO LOOK FORWARD
BUT THEY ALSO CAN'T STAY WITH THEIR HUMAN MINDERS FOR TOO LONG BECAUSE THEY'LL GET CONFUSED THEY'LL
IT'S DECEMBER AND IT'S BEEN EIGHT MONTHS SINCE I WAS LAST HERE IN ATLANTA
I WAS HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT OUR PANDA
FROM THE AGE OF TWELVE OR THIRTEEN
SHALL I ACTUALLY SAY THIS JOKE
WILL I GET AWAY WITH IT
PUT THE CHAIRS OUT
THE CAT IS ON THE CHAIR
AND THE MONKEY IS ON THE BRANCH
AND WHERE IS THE MONKEY
TO WEAR A DRESS
WAS I HAD TO GO TO FRANCE WITH A CAT
YOU'VE BROUGHT THE PERSON IN
IN YOUR OWN IMAGINATION
AS THE OTHER PERSON
IS NOW FEELING THE URGENCY YOU GOT TO GET EVERYBODY POSITION
EVEN THOUGH YOU CONTROL WHEN HE COMES INTO
I DEFINITELY SHOULD GIVE UP
BECAUSE ABOUT A WEEK AGO
PEOPLE SAY WHAT DO COMICS HAVE AT THE END OF A CAREER
IT WAS THE SUGGESTIVENESS
WHILE ALL THE AUDIENCE WOULD YELL
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SPENT
WHO HAVE YOU BEEN WITH
COULD YOU ACCOMMODATE ME
YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT
IT'S ON THE BORDER BETWEEN RUSSIA AND KOREA
OR EVEN A REALLY
THIRTY FIVE LEFT IN THE WILD
THIS IS WHERE ALL THE ORPHANS COME AT NIGHT
SHE'S GOT MONEY
WE'RE GOING TO BE JUMPING FOR JOY
AND THE OTHER ONE
I CAN SEE THE TEAMS LOOK FULL OF CONFIDENCE
LET'S HOPE THAT THESE TWO LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS
IT'S THE CAPTAINS
MATT'S IN FRONT ON TWELVE
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THAT
AND IT MAY COME OFF SOMETHING BUT
BUT THERE IS A REBOUND
WHICH THEN COMES BACK
HITS THE REFEREE AND THEN REBOUNDS INTO THE GOAL
IT'S NOTHING IT'S JUST RUBBISHY OLD BUSINESS STUFF
UM DON'T MAKE HER ANY PROMISES
I'M HELPING YOU
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY KNOW
LET ALONE JUDGE
KEEP A UNITED FRONT
WE'LL LOOK BACK AT SOME OF THE MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS OF SONGS OF PRAISE
AND ALONG THE WAY
YOU'LL DISCOVER THE SECRET TO THE SONGS OF PRAISE FORMULA
SHE'S A GREAT CHRISTIAN WOMAN
AND SO MY MOTHER'S PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS VERY MUSICAL
THE REAL STARS OF THE SHOW FOR ME AND
EXTRAORDINARY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CATHOLICS AND PROTESTANTS IS EXPRESSED IN NOTHING MORE VIOLENT THAN A BULLS
HE DESCRIBED IT AS
LET'S CALL IT GOD
NOW WITH DEMOCRACY ESTABLISHED
READY TO GO OFF
AND IT TOOK ABOUT HALF AN HOUR OF UNSCREEN TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT AT THE OTHER END
THEY'D BE ABLE TO GET OUT AND
BUT WHEN THE QUEEN WENT THROUGH A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER
I DID WONDER WHETHER WE'D EVER SEE HER AGAIN
IT CAN REACT TO MAJOR BREAKING NEWS
PRINCESS OF WALES
TO HEAR OF A YOUNG LIFE CUT SHORT VIOLENTLY AND HORRIFICALLY IS ALWAYS DISTURBING
BON SOIS AND WELCOME
AND HERE ARE THE FIRST FORTY PASSENGERS TO COME THROUGH THE CHANNEL TUNNEL
IN THEIR LATER YEARS
AND THEY WATCHED SONGS OF PRAISE UM AND WE CAN SAY THIS LITERALLY
IN A RARE EXAMPLE
OF THE DELIGHT OF WORSHIP
I ENJOY IT VERY MUCH
GREAT SIR HARRY SECOMBE
TO ALL OF YOU ON SONGS OF PRAISE
I WANT TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY
FIFTY WONDERFUL YEARS
AND HARRY WAS MY FAVOURITE BIG UNCLE
FROM ITS VERY BEGINNING
CONGREGATIONS HAVE TURNED OUT IN THEIR SUNDAY BEST TO SING THEIR FAVOURITE HYMNS
FAVOURITE NAUGHTY UNCLE
HE WOULD BREAK POMPOSITY
BUT HE HAD GREAT FAITH
A SHOW FOR ALL FAITHS
WHICH THIS WEEK COMES TO YOU FROM A LITTLE CHURCH IN SOME VILLAGE SOMEWHERE
AND WHAT A SURPRISE
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN ALONG THE WAY ALSO
RIPA ONCE
AND ANOTHER OCCASION
EVERYWHERE HE WENT
PROVED ITS WORTH
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US
AND IM SURE THAT SONGS OF PRAISE
CELEBRATING CHRISTIAN WORSHIP
CHRISTIAN SINGING OF HYMNS
THAT INSPIRING FOR SO LONG IS INCREDIBLE BUT
IT WAS VOTED THE NATION'S FAVOURITE BY YOU
HOW GREAT THOU ART
THANKS SO MUCH FOR TUNING IN EVERY WEEK
AT THEIR HEART WILL BE TWO SIMPLE ELEMENTS
HYMN SINGING AND PERSONAL TESTIMONIES
WHATEVER YOU DO
DON'T MISS THE PARTY
THE BIG DAY FINALLY ARRIVES
SONGS OF PRAISE OFFICIALLY TURNS FIFTY
SO IT STARTED SO
OUT OF ALL OUR YOUNG THAT WE'VE BRED HERE
AN INCREDIBLY RARE BIRD
THAT BABY SPIX MCAW TURNED OUT TO BE A
FOUR OR FIVE YEARS
IN THIS YEAR WE HAVE TO FIND A MALE FOR HER TO PAIR HER UP TO MAKE A NEW
IT'S ALWAYS THE BEST METHOD TOO TO MAKE NEW PAIRS
TO BRING THEM BACK TO BRAZIL
NOT ONLY IN CAPTIVITY
ALSO IN THE NATURE
I WAS WONDERING IF I SHOULD
FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT PILLS SHE WAS TAKING
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
BUT YOU CAN'T FEEL THAT WAY AGAIN
THEY'RE IN USE ALL OVER EUROPE
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE UK ACCREDITATION
I'VE TRACED ALL OF THE IMPLANTS
WE MAKE THIS A PRIORITY
WE WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM
SHE DOESN'T WANT ME SITTING BY HER BED
YOU NEED A SURGEON
IF YOU TELL HANSEN THE WHOLE TRUTH
THAT YOU OPERATED ON PATIENTS TO TRY AND PUT RIGHT FAULTY IMPLANTS
I'VE ORDERED YOU SOME PAIN RELIEF
THAT'S NOT JUST HIM EMPTYING HIS LUNGS
THEY GET VENOM INTO YOU
THEY'RE ONLY DOING IT FROM DEFENCE BUT
YOU SMELL LIKE CLOTHING
AND IF OTHER SCORPIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE MUCH MORE POTENT VENOM COME NEARBY
ALTHOUGH HE'S NOT VERY HARMFUL TO US
HE IS QUITE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL TO OTHER SCORPIONS
YOU'LL NOTICE THAT I HAVEN'T GOT THIS ONE ON MY HAND
AND NOR AM I TRYING TO GET IT TO STING ME
MY TRIP WOULD CERTAINLY BE OVER
WE HAVE PUT HIM ON FUDGE
UM BUT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY MY WORKING ENVIRONMENT
JUST IN THE BIG DOORS
FOR SOME REASON
THE ROYAL SCHOOL OF CHURCH MUSIC
MEAN WHAT WE DO AFFECTS WHO WE ARE
THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT
TO BUMP UP THE INVOICE
I'M HERE IN NOTTINGHAM
OR IS IT JUST A PLACE TO COME AND WORK
OR A PLACE TO GO AND BUY LOADS OF STUFF
OR DOES IT HAVE A SPIRITUAL HEART
HOW AS A CHRISTIAN ARE WE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THIS WORLD AND BRINGING GOD'S KINGDOM INTO A REAL
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME
I THINK I COULD SIT BACK IN MY ROCKING CHAIR WITH A FLAT CAP IF THAT HAPPENED AND JUST GO
JESUS TELLS THE STORY OF A MAN ON A JOURNEY TO JERICHO WHO IS AMBUSHED AND LEFT BATTERED
BLOODIED AND INJURED BY THE ROADSIDE
PEOPLE PASSED BY
WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE OLDCENTS FOR OUR FINAL SONG
I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS WITHIN THESE FOUR WALLS
BEFORE YOU BEGIN SEARCHING FOR WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
I KEPT MY HEAD DOWN AND FOCUSED ON MY WORK
HERE'S THE DEAL
WHAT IS COMPASSIONATE LEAVE
CHEMISTRY TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT CORROSION
ESPECIALLY THAT LOT
JUST LOOKING TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO MR BYRNE
SHE'S IN MY ROOM
IT'S JUST THAT WE BOTH KNOW WHERE WE STAND
IF YOU DON'T PLAY THE GAME
I JUST GOT USED TO USING THIS ONE AND
LET'S TAKE A WHISTLE STOP TOUR OF OTHER PROGRAMS
STATISTICS THOSE THINGS THAT SEEM TO BE MASSAGED UP AND DOWN ACCORDING TO THE PERSON WHO'S GIVING THEM
AND THE SAME IS TRUE
OF QUOTES FROM COWBOY BUILDERS
CRITICISM THAT NO REAL ACTION IS TAKEN AGAINST THE COWBOYS WHO ARE UNCOVERED IN THOSE TYPES OF
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING COMMENT FROM THE THE VIEWER AND
RIGHT UP YOUR STREET
SOME BRAND NEW SCIENCE SERIES HAVE STARTED THIS WEEK
SO YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT TEMPTED TO TO MIX AND MATCH WITHOUT TELLING THE VIEWER
DR ALICE ROBERTS IS BACK WITH HER NEW SERIES
BACK TO NORMAL NEXT WEEK
DO SEND US YOUR FEEDBACK ON WHATEVER YOU ARE WATCHING ON THE BBC
IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO GET A POSITIVE RESPONSE AND FOR PEOPLE TO PERHAPS BROADLY
BECAUSE WHAT DAMAGE IS CAUSED NOW IN THE SHORT TERM IN THE INTERESTS OF FINANCIAL GAIN
AND THEY'RE SO QUICK
WE'RE LOOKING FOR BOTH
BECAUSE THE STORY OF THEIR RESCUE WAS SPLASHED ALL OVER THE NEWSPAPERS
AND IN MORE RECENT YEARS
UM THE WAY THAT THEY BREED IS BY GRADUALLY IN FILLING AREAS
BUT THAT'S PROBABLY NOT FOR ME TO SAY
THEY THEY WILL LOSE ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF THOSE BIRDS TO TO OTHER LOSSES
IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS AND
FOR THE NATURE OF MY BUSINESS
WOULD WE BE ABLE TO COPE
THAT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ASK
ROUGH ANIMALS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND THE OTHER JOB IS A NINE TO FIVE LA WITH NO ON CALL
WHEN THOSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE COMPARED AGAINST THE SAME SALARY
YOU CAN'T REALLY PICK A CHAMPION OUT THE LITTER BUT IF YOU GO FOR THE RIGHT LINES
IS SELLING FAST
FOR WANT OF A BETTER TERM
IT MAY DECIDE IT WANTS TO MAKE THE DIVER ITS PROPERTY
WHERE WE WILLLL BE LOOKING BACK THROUGH THE ARCHIVES AT THE CONTRIBUTION OUR COUNTRYSIDE HAS MADE TO
THE DEAL IS HOPING FOR A
WE'RE HEADING OFF TO NORTH YORKSHIRE
THE EXISTING HALL ON THE SITE
IN THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD
HAVING SAID THAT
YOU GAVE THOMAS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
ON THE OTHER HAND
IS PLUS FIVE POS ON THAT ITEM
I DID SAY IF I WON THE LOT TREE
GLASGOW MEETS EDINBURGH
TWENTY EIGHT HOURS A WEEK AT PEAK TIME
WITHIN THE HINGED COVER
I THINK YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE WITH THAT
WE'VE NIPPED ACROSS SCOTLAND TO GLASGOW
BUT THIS IS QUITE A NICE EXAMPLE
DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH THEIR PLANT STAND
THAT'S THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION
THE MARKET'S NOT WHAT IT WAS
COMING UP NEXT ON THE ONE SHOW
THEY NOT ALLOWED TO CATCH HIM
THEY HAVE MANY DOG ANDNO
AND HE COMES FROM AMERICA
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE WARM WEATHER THAT MEANS THE
IF YOU DID ACTUALLY SEE A ROBBERY TAKE PLACE
THE WHOLE THING WAS VERY UPSETTING
IN SPAIN THEY DANCE THE FLAMENCO
I WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME POINTERS
IF SOMEONE SAYS
THE X FACTOR IT'S A HUGE
BACK ROOM DEALS
THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT IN THE LIFE OF THIS GOVERNMENT
THEY FANCY THE PIGEON
THIS IS SPORT IN ENGLAND
IT'S LIKE A FOOTBALL EXCEPT THE PLAYERS ARE MUCH BETTER LOOKING
LET'S LIFT THAT MOOD
YOU SAYING THAT
IT'S EVERY PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE
THAT'S A REAL SHAME
THOUGH TO BE HONEST
DID YOU SAY ACCIDENT
WELCOME TO KENT
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
YOU CLEAN SHAVEN
AND FRESH FROM HOME BOY
I COLLECTUS ENAMEL BOXES
BUT SORT OF MODERN
THE MONEY IS ALL SPENT
YOU KNOW THE FORM
PROBABLY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
SOMEBODY WHO HAS APPARENTLY BEEN TRIPPING THE LIGHT FANTASTIC
TWIRLING HER WAY THROUGH A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT LEONARDO DA VINCI IS FIONA BRUCE
LEAVING SOME VIEWERS TO ASK
WHERE ARE THE PAINTINGS
ONE OF THE BBC'S MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS
HOW MANY APPLICATIONS DID THEY GET
THAT FRANK'S USUAL HOME IS THE NEWS BULLETIN
BUT IT'S NOT JUST A SERIOUS MODE THAT NEWS OPERATES
ACCORDING TO VIEWER DUNCAN YATES
BULLETIN PRODUCERS GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO FIND A NEGATIVE SPIN FOR NEARLY EVERY ISSUE
AND IT IS A HUNG JURY ON THE SOLICITOR DRAMA HIDDEN AS WELL
INITIAL FEEDBACK TO US MAINLY CONCERNED THE WOBBLY CAMERA WORK
WHERE HAVE WE HEARD THAT BEFORE
SO THAT WAS THE POINT OF THE TITLE
AND THEY WEREN'T TEASING US READY FOR SEASON TWO
AS IT WAS ONLY COMMISSIONED AS A FOUR PART SERIAL
BUT BBC DAYTIME COURT DRAMA THE CASE HAS SECURED ITSELF A SEASON TWO
AFTER COMMENTS TO US CLAIMING IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR A PRIMETIME SLOT
IT HAS NOT MIGRATED TO PEAK YET
WE HAVE NO NO SAY IN IT
BUT IF THE RUMPUS TRIGGERED BY TALES FROM THE NATIONAL PARKS IS ANYTHING TO GO BY
STRONGLY REFUTES ANY CLAIMS OF LACK OF BALANCE
THE FILM WAS NOT ABOUT WHETHER OFFROERSS OR ANTI OFF ROADERS ARE RIGHT
THERE IS NO DICTAT
BUT DATES ARE SET IN LINE WITH THE ROYAL BRITISH LEGION'S OWN LAUNCH
BE SOME REMEMBRANCE PROGRAMMING IN THE COMING WEEKS SO
SO IF YOU GOT ANY FEEDBACK ON THAT
AND YOU'D HAVE SEEN SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY
SOMETHING TO PUT THIS PART OF THE WORLD ON THE MAP THE FOVANT BADGES
AH BECAUSE THEY ARE HERE TO REMIND PEOPLE
THOUSAND TREES WITH FAR MORE EMOTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE THAN ANY
YOU TEND TO WORK ROUND THE SITUATION
BUT YOU CAN'T GET AT IT FOR WEEDS
YOU CALL IN SPECIAL HELP
THEY FINALLY LEFT THE SITE THEN
HERE'S JOHN WITH A REMINDER OF HOW YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON ONE
IT HAD BEEN CHOSEN THE PREVIOUS YEAR
THE SKYLINE CHANGED
WHERE ONCE MEN AND TRACTORS AND HORSES WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING THE FIELDS
READY AND WAITING TO TAKE THE WAR OVER TO GERMANY
BACK IN DEAR OLD ENGLAND
BUT JUST BECAUSE IT'S TUCKED AWAY IN A CORNER OF SUFFOLK
AND THAT'S WHERE THEY MAKE THE EMOTIONAL CONNECTION
I'LL BE JOINING MATT IN DERBYSHIRE'S BEAUTIFUL DERWENT VALLEY
AND IT'S VERY POPULAR
WE HAVE THE PLANET SATURN
ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO OR SO
WAS THE WATER LIQUID OR NOT
BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY TOPICAL AND WE'VE JUST SHOWN YOU ONE NEW DESIGN STUDY
I COULDN'T GET THERE
WE'VE GOT MISSIONS ALL OVER MARS
CASSINI'S STILL AT SATURN AND THERE'S EVEN A PROBE
ON THE WAY TO PLUTO
SO AND TO DISCUSS THE FLOOD OF DATA THAT THEY'RE ALL SENDING BACK
AND THEN COME OVER HERE
I'VE GOT TWO KIDS
I WAS REALLY FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO SET UP A PROJECT FOR VULNERABLE WOMEN
THEN GO OUT TO THE AUCTION
MEANWHILE WE'RE HEADING ACROSS AND UP INTO THE HILLS
THAT IS GOING TO BE REALLY
MEANWHILE WHY DON'T WE FIND OUT WHAT THE BLUE TEAM BOUGHT
WHICH WAS JUST AS WELL
AND HOW MUCH IS SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND
A GOOD BREAKFAST SETS YOU UP
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
THEY'RE PRETTY ENOUGH
I'M LOUIS WALSH
I KNOW ALL ABOUT GREAT POP MUSIC
WHERE THE WHOLE STAFF SPOKE ENGLISH AND WERE CLEAN SHAVEN
WHICH IS A PERSONAL RECORD FOR ME
BUT THEY ARE FOR ME
I SAID G'DAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY IN AUSTRALIA
IT'S JUST WHEN I DO A DUET WITH SOMEONE
I COULD HAVE YOU DEPORTED
EVEN WHEN I'M ECSTATIC
DON'T BE STUPID
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT INVOLVES
PROFESSOR BRIAN COX
YOU CAN'T GET MORE OF A FLAMING STAR THAN THIS JUMPED UP LITTLE HAIRCUT
PROFESSOR BRIAN COX
THAT SEARCH PLANE MIGHT HAVE GONE
A LAME DUCK PRIME MINISTER
EVERY DAY YOU SEE YOUR REFLECTION IN YOUR NEWBORN'S FACE
I'M NOT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT PURE HUMAN
IT'S ALSO MADE ME EXTREMELY HUNGRY
I'VE LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT
I WAS BORN IN THIS AREA
NOBODY HAS ANY MONEY
WE NEED SOME HELP FROM VERY SPECIFIC TRADES
EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG CHANGE
WE CAN'T DO THIS
AND THEY HAVE MADE A CHANGE A LASTING CHANGE FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THIS AREA
FROM LANDS END TO JOHN O GRO AND EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN
SO TONIGHT I'M GOING TO REVISIT SOME OF MY FAVORITE MOMENTS FROM THE LAST TWO SERIES
JUST FOR TONIGHT
SOME BRAND NEW SURPRISES YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
LIKE WHAT I SAID ABOUT BEING LIKE ORGANIC AND NATURAL
AS LONG AS YOU DESERVE IT
AND HOW DOES IT FEEL TO SUDDENLY FIND YOURSELF UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH YOUR IDOL
NOW MOST PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE HERE TO WATCH A SHOW BUT
THEY'RE NOT JUST HERE TO BE ENTERTAINED
CLASSY SONGS DESERVE CLASSY PERFORMANCES AND ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE WAS WHEN A YOUNG WOMAN FROM
I'M READY TO GO IN
APART FROM EVERYTHING
MYSELF AND THE TONIGHT TONIGHT TEAM USED WHAT WE KNOW BEST
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG
SHE'S HAD THE LESSONS AND SHE'S DONE THE HOMEWORK
THERE ARE PLENTY OF DANCE STREAMERS OUT THERE
AND WHEN THEY HIT THIS STAGE
THE RESULTS CAN BE SPECTACULAR
WE'VE HIRED THIS DANCE STUDIO IN WEST LONDON TO PUT SUNNY AND SHAM THROUGH THEIR PACES
BUT THIS AUDITION WILL BE FAR FROM ROUTINE
WE'LL BE BACK TO PUT MORE DESERVING PEOPLE IN THE SPOTLIGHT SOON
SO IF SOMETHING STRANGE STARTS HAPPENING TO YOU
IT MIGHT JUST BE ME COMING TO GIVE YOU THE DREAM OF A LIFETIME
SO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN AND KEEP DREAMING
RAILWAYS AND SO ON
THIS IS HOW THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION STARTED
THEY RECEIVED WORLD HERITAGE STATUS
IF NOT PROPERLY
REINVENTING THE WHEEL TO SOME EXTENT
IT'S RIGHT FOR THE NATIONAL PARK
SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HERE IN DERBYSHIRE IN PARTICULAR
THERE COULD BE A VIBRANT FUTURE ALONG WITH A WATER POWERED PAST
AH WHILST SHEEP AND CATTLE FARMERS ARE MAKING THE MOST OF RISING MEAT PRICES
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HIGH COST OF FOOD AT THE MOMENT
FEED IS THE BIGGEST SINGLE COST IN REARING PIGS
ORRE ON NEEDWOOD FARM IN STAFFORDSHIRE
AND MARTIN BARKER IS THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE BUSINESS HERE
MAYBE TEN PERCENT FUEL INCREASE
BUT WE ALSO GROW THE GRAIN
WE ALSO KEEP DAIRY
WE ALSO KEEP BEEF CATTLE
SO SOMETHING WORKS FOR US ALL THE TIME
UM WE DON'T HAVE ALL OUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET
YOU CAN HAVE A LARGE FARMING ESTATE WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS ON IT
AND THAT IS NOT BAD
WHAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT AND WHAT THE SOIL ASSOCIATION IS CONCERNED ABOUT IS HAVING A LOT OF ANIMALS IN ONE AIRSPACE
I THINK WHEN YOU GET THOSE SIZE OF UNITS
WHEN THEY COME UNDER FINANCIAL PRESSURE
WHICH THEY WILL DO
THEN IF THEY DO GO WRONG
IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY
IT DOES GIVE ME SOME HOPE THAT DONE RIGHT
THERE IS A FUTURE FOR BRITISH PIG FARMING
THERE'S ENOUGH WATER TO REEMERGE AS SPRINGS TO FORM THE RIVER
ALL IS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE
IF WE HAVE TO SELL PIGS ON THE OPEN MARKET
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET YOUR HANDS ON ONE
HERE'S JOHN WITH ALL THE DETAILS
ONCE A PLAYGROUND FOR ROYALTY
BUT FROM THE HILLS OF HAKE
IT'S THAT TIME OF THE DAY AGAIN
QUITE FUNKY ARCHITECTURE AND INTERESTING GLASS
WHAT FUN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TODAY
POLITICS MEETS ARCHITECTURE
I'M GETTING BACK TO WRITING AGAIN
I'VE MADE LOTS AND LOTS OF FRIENDS
RIGHT TO THE LINE AS USUAL
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
THERE'S NO SHAME IN THAT
IF I SAY IT PROPERLY
I'M NOT WALKING THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE SOUTH WEST COAST PATH BECAUSE THAT WOULD TAKE ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS
THE COMMON WHITE BEAM AND THE SERVICE TREE
IF YOU'RE AWARE OF ANY
IT'S SO PEACEFUL HERE
YOU REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU CAN BE LOUD
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY
IT COULD HAPPEN TOMORROW
AND WITH ENERGY PRICES ON THE INCREASE
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER EITHER WAY
BECAUSE THE OUTCOME IS EXACTLY THE SAME
WHETHER YOU LOOK AT IT FROM COST OR ENVIRONMENT
BUT WHEN THE NORMANS ARRIVED
WE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IT
AH PROBABLY SOMETHING JUST HAPPENED TO MUM IN THE NIGHT
SHE HAS WANDERED OFF
AND WE HAVE A VERY STRICT POLICY HERE
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE READY TO GO HOME
WILL THEY KNOW HOW TO COPE IN THE WILD
THE BIG QUESTION IS
BUT WE'VE GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THERE
HOW TIME FLIES WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FUN
BUT OVERALL I'D SAY THEY NEED THEIR BONUS BUY
IT WAS ALL TO DO WITH YOU
HERE COMES THE FORTUNE TELLING DICE
TAKE SEVEN OFF THAT
WHICH IS BAD LUCK
BEN WAS ONE OF OVER ONE HUNDRED TEENAGERS THAT DIED IN THE UK AS A RESULT OF YOUTH VIOLENCE BETWEEN
EVER SINCE HIS DEATH
I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE TO EXPERIENCE THE PAIN AND LOSS THAT WE FEEL THROUGH LOSING
TEACHERS AND YOUTH WORKERS IN THE MOST TROUBLED PARTS OF THE UK
TRAINING THEM TO TACKLE THE CAUSES OF KNIFE CRIME
THESE PROGRAMS CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE
THE CHARITY PROVIDED TRAINING TO STRATHCLYDE POLICE AROUND GANGS AND IN THE NEXT YEAR
PLEASE KEEP TRYING
JUST HANGING AROUND WITH FRIENDS THAT WAS IN THE SAME POSITION
THERE'S A CHARITY THAT UNDERSTANDS HOW EASILY ARGUMENTS CAN ESCALATE INTO VIOLENCE
AND HOW HARD IT CAN BE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO ESCAPE FROM THIS SEEMINGLY ONE WAY TRACK
KNOWN TO MANY SIMPLY AS LEAP
WORKS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF CONFLICT
TEACHING THEM WAYS TO RESOLVE SITUATIONS WITHOUT VIOLENCE
THIS IS WHY THE CHARITY ESTABLISHED ITS YOUNG TRAINERS PROGRAMME
WHERE THE MOST PROMISING EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS ARE RECRUITED AND TRAINED TO DELIVER THE WORKSHOPS
IT SEEMS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS YEAR'S REMEMBRANCE PROGRAMMING ON TV WAS ANTIQUES ROADSHOW
MAYBE NOT THE PROGRAMME YOU'D EXPECT
AND OFFERED THE ULTIMATE
IF SLIGHTLY DOUBLE EDGED COMPLIMENT
C B ALL DAY
GARROW'S LAW IS BACK ON SUNDAY NIGHTS
AND BOTH ARE DESCRIBED AS SAMEY OR PREDICTABLE
THE APPRENTICE CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE A WINNING FORMULA
IT HAS SPAWNED THE CURRENT YOUNG APPRENTICE
AH TO A VIEWER WHO'D LIKE TO SEE A RETURN TO THREE D TV
I DID SAY A RETURN TO A FORMAT THAT'S ONLY JUST APPEARING AT THE MOST FUTURISTIC OF TECHNOLOGY
I WANT TO SEE THAT PROGRAMME
YOU CAN GET A REACTION BEFORE IT'S BROADCAST
SO FROM OUR MESSAGEBOARDS
LIFE'S TOO SHORT
RARELY HAS A PROGRAMME RECEIVED SO MUCH PUBLICITY PRIOR TO BROADCAST
DURING OR AFTER PROGRAMS
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ABOUT COOKERY
BUT IF YOU BELIEVE SUE RICHMOND
I'VE BEEN A VEGETARIAN SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE
AND I JUST WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
WOULD TELL YOU THAT ACTUALLY
I SOMETIMES STRUGGLE TO RECALL THE NAMES OF WORLD LEADERS
I GUESS WE ALL DO
IF YOU SPOT ANY HOWLERS OR FEEL OUR ATTENTION SHOULD BE DRAWN TO ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN
AFTER YEARS OF NEGLECT
SCRUB HAS OVERWHELMED ALONG THE HILL
FISHING IS A PIVOTAL PART OF LIFE
I THINK THERE ARE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS IN SPECIFIC AREAS
THESE OYSTERS CAN BE FREELY CAUGHT IN THE WATERS AROUND HERE
SO THE ANSWER SEEMS OBVIOUS
INSTEAD OF ISSUING INDIVIDUAL QUOTAS TO FISHERMEN IT WANTS TO TEST A COMMUNITY QUOTA SYSTEM
ANIMALS MOSTLY RARE BREED BECAUSE THEY SLOW GROWING
I CAN'T DO MUCH HANDLING OF STOCK OR ANYTHING
IT'S A BIT OF AN ALIEN ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM
I WAS MOVING SOME COWS ON A SUNDAY MORNING
THERE'S JUST THIRTY THREE DAYS TO GO UNTIL CHRISTMAS AND IF YOU'RE STUCK FOR IDEAS
ELLIE WILL BE FINDING OUT HOW THE HUMBLE BICYCLE OPENED UP THE COUNTRYSIDE TO FORK
SOMETHING VERY EASY TO RIDE
NEXT WEEK I'LL BE TAKING TO THE WATERS TO TRY OUT A NEW CANOEING ROUTE OFF THE COAST OF ANTRUM
SOMETIMES WHETHER THEY WIN OR LOSE DOESN
THAT'S A GOOD NUMBER
YOU THINK ABOUT IT A HUNDRED
WHICH IS IN MARCH
HERE'S YOUR TENANCY AGREEMENT
THAT'S ONE POUND EIGHT AND SIXPENCE
WOULD YOU HAVE ON ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
IF IT WAS MADE OUT OF IVORY
SO I THINK IF THERE'S A DARK HOLE
SO THEY'RE NOT FAR OFF ON ANY OF IT
I SAW A COUPLE OF THINGS
SHE SIMPLY COMMISSIONED ANOTHER ROOM IN WHICH TO PLACE THEM IN THE STYLE THAT SHE HAD
SIX ITEMS BOUGHT
PAID FOR AND READY TO BE AUCTIONED
THAT'S SORT OF MY MAIN JOB
BUT ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO
BUTTONS AND BEADS
THEY THINK I'M A RIGHT GRANDMA
KIND OF SENSIBLE
SO I'VE KIND OF GOT THIS NICKNAME
QUITE A BIT ACTUALLY BECAUSE
I'D SAY PROBABLY EDWARDIAN
ON A WINTRY EVENING
AND THE OLD MAIDS USED TO COME IN AND CHUCK OUT A BUCKET OF WATER
THE MAHOGANY DOESN'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH
YOU OWN THIS HOUSE
YOU'RE TROTTING BACK AND FORTH OVER THAT CAUSEWAY
YOU NEED TO WORK OUT VERY
SO NEARER FIFTY TO EIGHTY
IT'S GOING TO COME FROM THE COAL PIT
ANN SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE BOY
BUT HE AT LEAST HAD MY GRANDMOTHER
WE ALL TOOK IT FOR GRANTED
AND WHAT BAFFLES ME IS THAT NOW WE WOULD REGARD THAT WITH HORROR
WE HAVE MORE FAMILY BREAK UP THAN WE'VE EVER HAD BEFORE
SO IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS IMMEASURABLY STRANGE TO HER
AND ONE OF THE THINGS SHE DID
IT WAS THE OLD TRICK
WHICH WAS QUITE COMMON THEN
BECAUSE SHE COULD SORT OF BETLE AROUND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
I WAS BY NO MEANS THE ONLY ANGLICAN IN THE SCHOOL WE
WE WERE TAUGHT THAT NON CATHOLICHOLICS WERE
THEY NEVER ACTUALLY USED THE WORD INFERIOR BUT
THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING HAPPENING
WE WERE NEVER ALLOWED TO READ SET SPEECHES
I DIDN'T CHANGE MY MIND
I MEAN THIS WAS MY FIRST EVER TELEVISED DEBATE
ABOUT IT IT RAN ITS COURSE
I WOULD QUITE LIKE
THEY THEY SIMPLY MAKING THEIR LIFE THE BEST IT CAN BE
ITS NOT JUST ABOUT LIFE AFTER DEATH AND ETERNAL SALVATION
THERE WASN'T A DISAPPOINTMENT
WHY DID AUNT ANN SUDDENLY NOT COME TO CHURCH EVERY WEEK
I SUSPECT THAT SORT OF WAS PART OF HER HARDENING PROCESS
PARTY IS TRYING TO PUT AN END TO
UM AND IN THOSE DAYS
THERE WAS NO HELP
I MEAN IT WAS SERIOUSLY HIGH
PEOPLE WOULD GO INTO DETAIL AND AND THEY WOULD SWOT UP IN ORDER TO DEBATE
YOU WOULD SPOT IN ANY YEAR IN OXFORD
WAS HE GOING TO TAKE THE VOTE WITH HIM
I GOT THERE ON THE SAME BASIS AS THE MEN
IF YOUVE GOT POSITIVE DISCRIMINATION AND
FOR THIS REASON THAT
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOKED IN PARLIAMENT UM
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME HELP
IT WAS A THREE WAY MARGINAL
HAD FOUND YOURSELF AT UNIVERSITY
WHEN YOU'RE VERY CONFIDENT OF THE CAUSE
BUT ON THIS OCCASION
BUT AS IT HAPPENS
BECAUSE IT WAS WHILE I WAS CAMPAIGNING ON THE PRO LIFE ISSUES THAT I CAME SO MUCH INTO
IS THIS THEOLOGICALLY RIGHT
IF WE DON'T DO THIS
AND SO AND SO IN MANY WAYS
WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO A VERY QUIET
BUT I WAS SENSIBLE
THE EXCITEMENT HAD GONE
YOU ARE ACTUALLY WINNING
I ALWAYS SAID THAT I WOULD
WOULD BELIEVE I HAD GOT IN WHEN I FELT THE GREEN LEATHER UNDERNEATH ME
AND YET THE BOSS WAS MRS THATCHER
THEY CERTAINLY GET SPECIAL PRESENTS AND THINGS
I'M JUST ONE OF MANY MANY
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF DAVID CAMERON AS LEADER
WAS THAT YOUR CHOICE
SO YOU LOOK FORWARD
YOU DON'T LOOK BACK TO WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OR EVEN WHAT YOU THINK SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOUGH
ANTON SAID TO ME THE LESS TIME YOU SPEND WITH YOUR FEET ON THE FLOOR
YOU CAN GIVE UP
A FEW YEARS LATER
BECAUSE I'M OFF A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW
TRACK WEATHER FOR THE WEEK
MANY RURAL AREAS WILL BE BELOW FREEZING
MAYBE A BIT OF MIS AND FOG IN THE SOUTH EASTT OF ENGLAND FIRST THING
LOTS OF WEATHER FRONTS
ESSENTIALLY IT LOOKS LIKE THURSDAY COULD BE A PRETTY WET
BUT PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE ELSE
THIS WAS PRODUCED IN ZIMBABWE
AND NOW HE THINKS HE MAY JUST HAVE FOUND IT
EARLIER THIS YEAR
AND HAVE LIVED IN THE SAME AREA
MOST OF US KNOW THAT THESE DAYS
DOCTORS ARE FAR LESS LIKELY TO PRESCRIBERS WITH ANTIBIOTICS
BUT IS THE SAME KIND OF RESTRAINT BEING SHOWN WHEN IT COMES TO TREATING THE ANIMALS THAT WE EAT
TOM HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING
DOWN THE LINE MEANS CHEAPER FOOD AND GREATER PROFITS FOR FARMERS
EVERYONE IS A WINNER
WE COULD OVERDOSE
BECAUSE IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE STUFF
SO WE USE THE RIGHT AMOUNT TO DO THE RIGHT JOB
SO THAT THE FARMERS CAN INJECT THE COW IN THE MORNING
POSITIVE ABOUT IT
WE DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY IT'S GOING
EARLIER THIS YEAR
UM THERE ARE ONLY TWENTY LEFT IN THE WORLD
SO THAT'S ONE DOWN
THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER
BECAUSE NOW CLIVE'S FARM HAS CLOSED DOWN
BUT I REALLY LOVE SHOPPING
I FINISHED FOR GOOD ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO
IN VARIOUS OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE NORTH WEST
BUT I'VE GOT TO GET THIRTY
IN AN ISLAMIC SALE
IT COULD BE WORTH A
WITHOUT ANY DURESS
AND IT'S A COMPASS AND I CAN NEVER FIND WHERE I'M GOING
A VENETIAN WHO CAME HERE BETWEEN ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND NINE AND SEVENTEEN
THAT'S A LOVELY GUARANTEE
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
THE BACK OF MY NECK LOOKING MIGHTY PRETTY
WE CAN'T COVER IT UP
RIGHT HAPPY WITH THIS
FANCY A SINGING LESSON FROM A LEGEND
WHETHER IT'S SINGING WITH A LEGEND
WELL MR MANILOW WILL SEE YOU NOW
HOW ABOUT A DUET WITH A SOUL SUPERSTAR
DIONNE WARWICK HAS A SPARE MICROPHONE
MAYBE YOUR IDOL IS THE QUEEN OF COUNTRY
DANCING IN THE WEST END OR JUST SOMETHING NICE AND SIMPLE LIKE JUMPING OUT OF A PLANE AT THIRTY
THIS IS YOUR ONE STOP SHOP FOR MAKING DREAMS A REALITY
THEN DANCING DOWN THE STREET AT RUSH HOUR
WOULD YOU SAY THAT
THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE BUT
BUT VERY FEW DREAMS ARE BEYOND US
DUETTING WITH THE LEGENDARY DUSTY SPRINGFIELD
TO BE ABLE TO SING WITH A LEGEND LIKE THAT
IT'S ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT
I CAN'T SAY ANY MORE
IT WAS TRULY A DREAM DUET
DUSTY SPRINGFIELD AND
TIME TRAVEL OR PARALLEL UNIVERSES
I HAVE A PROBLEM
I CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE
DESPITE MY TIME ON DOCTOR WHO
I HAVE NO ACCESS TO CLONING
I UNDERSTAND THESE DREAMS BECAUSE I'VE HAD THEM MYSELF
WHEN I WAS YOUNG
I WANTED TO SING IN THE WEST END YEAH
HOLD ON A MINUTE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING
I'M LIKE A ZOMBIE IN
AND SO FOR THIS NEXT SURPRISE
AND WE'RE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
I'LL BE MEETING SOME ICONIC ANIMALS
I'LL BE LOOKING BACK AT THE BEST OF THE BBC'S RURAL PROGRAMS FROM THIS PART OF THE WORLD
AND SO THEN I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
AS WELL BECAUSE THE HUGE SKIES
IN TERMS OF FARMING
SOME OF THE FARMS HERE
SOME ON SOME OF THE FIELDS
AH BIGGER THAN MY ENTIRE FARM
YOU DON'T PUT THEM TOGETHER STRAIGHTAWAY BUT
BUT WITHIN THREE DAYS
SHE STARTED TO BAG UP AND COME IN TO MILK
THIS MIGHT LOOK LIKE A LOAD OF JAGGED RUINS
BUT WHEN YOU SPEND A BIT OF TIME HERE
AND THE REASON THAT THE BARONS CAME HERE ON ST EDMUND'S DAY WAS THAT THAT WAS A PERFECTLY GOOD COVER FOR THEM
AND THEN YOU GOT THE HIGH LEVEL
WHO SHOULD OWN IT
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH IT
THERE'S ONE THING THAT CANNOT BE DENIED
IT'S ACTUALLY A REALITY FOR AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE
WHO OWNS A PATCH OF WOODLAND IN KENT
SMALL WHITE BUTTERFLY
BECAUSE THEY ARE PLANTING TREES
I'M LOOKING FOR THE SWALLOWTAIL
WE GOT SOME FANTASTIC AND REALLY
SHE WON'T BOTHER
ALTHOUGH I'M PROUD OF THEM
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN ATTRACTING YOUR ATTENTION
WHO RUNS BBC THREE
I'D LIKE TO START
WHY IS BRITISH MASTERCHEF SO BORING AND DULL
WHY ARE THE MAIN PRESENTERS SO LOW WATTAGE
IT'S GOT FRESH SCENARIOS ALL THE TIME
TIM WAS WATCHING AUSTRALIAN MASTER CHEF WHICH HE REALLY ENJOYED
WE LOVE HAVING IT ON BBC THREE
WITH THE YOUNG ADULT AUDIENCE
BEING SO TECHNO SAVVY
COULD GET INTO
BUT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT I HAD TO HAVE A DECENT BROADBAND CONNECTION
WOULDN'T THIS BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
WHY NOT HAVE BBC THREE PICK IT UP
OR MAYBE HAVE ANOTHER TECHNOLOGY SLOT
IN TERMS OF BBC THREE
FO WHO'S ON OUR MESSAGE BOARD AND
SO FOR YOUNG ADULTS
IT'S ALSO CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED
SO THE CHANNEL'S ON CREATIVE FIRE AND THE AUDIENCE SEEM TO LOVE IT
WE THEN FUND THAT AND THEY CHOOSE HOW THEY SPEND IT
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN
IF YOU WANT TO BE IN TOUCH WITH US AND EACH OTHER
JUST GO ON THE MESSAGE BOARD
YET IT'S THE KEY TO GETTING AT A WEALTH OF NATURAL GAS THAT WE HAVE TRAPPED BENEATH THE BRITISH
BUT AT WHAT COST
DRILLING FOR SHALE GAS HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD AS A GREAT NEW HOPE
OF KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON
IF YOU'RE BREAKING UP THE ROCKS DOWN BELOW US AND IF YOU'RE TURNING AROUND AND RUPTURING THE LIMESTONE
PULLING IT APART
THE BACKWASH OF IT CAN COME UP INTO THE FISSURES
COULD GO INTO THE CAVES
DELIBERATE MALICIOUS CRUELTY
THEY WERE JUST OVERWORKED
THAT'S THE HIGH TECH METHOD OF BREAKING UP THE SHALE THOUSANDS OF FEET DOWN TO GET TO THE
WE DID WE DID FIVE ALTOGETHER
TO KEEP OUR LIGHTS ON FOR DECADES
IF THEY'RE GOING TO START DRILLING DOWN INTO THE MENDIP PLATEAU
BUT GETTING IT IS TRICKY AND ITS CONTROVERSIAL
AND INTERFERING WITH THE AQUIFERS
THEY ARE GOING TO POLLUTE THE SPRINGS AND THE WATER THAT RUNS ACROSS TO BATH
AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS
OR IF IT IF WE LOSE THE SOURCE OF ITS ACTUAL HEATING BECAUSE BEAR IN MIND ITS COMING OFF THE MENDIPS
GOING DEEP DOWN INTO THE UNDERGROUND SYSTEMS AND ITS BEING SUPER HEATED BEFORE IT GOES TO BATH WHAT
AND THEY HAPPEN NATURALLY
AND SO WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS A NATURAL LEVEL OF EARTHQUAKE ACTIVITY BEFORE WE CAN START BLAMING PEOPLE FOR
BUT IT IS A VERY HIGH CARBON FUEL
AND WE SHOULD NOW BE MAKING THE TRANSITION VERY RAPIDLY TO ZERO OR VERY LOW CARBON FUELS AND
I DON'T THINK THAT SHALE GAS WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ADVERSELY ON OUR TARGETS
IF WE CAN DECARBONISE OUR ELECTRICITY SUPPLY
BY CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE
THE JOB ISN'T DONE
DEPENDING ON ITS SIZE
LOCAL GIRL HELEN RETURNED HOME TO CUMBRIA TO ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S OLDEST TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL
THAT'S THE NAME
YOU NEED TO BUY A COUNTRYFILE CALENDAR
SOLD IN AID OF CHILDREN IN NEED
BUT IT'S ANOTHER LITERARY GREAT THAT I'M HERE TO FIND OUT ABOUT
I'LL BE OFF ROADING WITH A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE SHORES OF LOCH LOMOND
AND MATT WILL BE SWIMMING WITH HORSES AROUND THE ISLANDS OF THE LOCH
WHEN IT FLEW PAST URANUS
GAVE US AN IDEA WHAT WE THOUGHT A NICE GIANT SHOULD BE LIKE
DISTANT PAST OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE ICE GIANTS FORMED IN THE FIRST PLACE
ON THE OTHER HAND
AND THE PLANET'S SPINNING LIKE THIS
THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT COLLISIONS OF THIS SORT WERE HAPPENING
THE MOTIONS OF THESE PLANETS IS CAUSING GRAVITATIONAL INSTABILITIES AND IT'S FLINGING MATERIAL
THE ONE WHICH HE USED TO DISCOVER OWNERUS
READ BOOKS ON OPTICS
HE TAUGHT HIMSELF ITALIAN AND LATIN
AND I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH A FLASHBACK TO THE COMMUNICATION SATELLITE WHICH YOU MENTIONED
AND TO PUT US IN CONTEXT
APOLLO WAS STILL IN THE PLANNING
WE'D HAD PEOPLE INTO SPACE BUT
BUT ONLY A FEW PROBES WHIZZING PAST THE MOON AND
BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY TOPICAL AND WE'VE JUST SHOWN YOU ONE NEW DESIGN STUDY
WE WILL HAVE TO PUT OUR BASES UNDERGROUND
BUT I RATHER HOPE THAT THE NECESSITY OF A LUNAR UNDERGROUND MOVEMENT DOES NOT ARISE
THEY SAY THAT THE WATERS ROUND THESE PARTS HAVE MAGICAL PROPERTIES
WHEN WE LIVED IN SOUTH AFRICA
LET'S GO AND MEET TODAY'S TEAM
THIS THING IS CALLED A LIBRARY LONG ARM
AND HEY PRESTO IT SAVES YOU GETTING THE LADDER OUT
IN A FAIRGROUND YOU CAN FIND IT FOR FIFTY
IN A SPECIALIST ENGLISH FURNITURE SALE
YOU CAN SELL IT FOR FOUR HUNDRED
AND I WOULD LIKE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN
WITH A TABLE ADMITTEDLY
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
THEY START OFF WITH THE TRAVELLING WARDROBE
DO YOU LIKE THAT
THAT'S BECAUSE HE WAS AN ARISTOCRAT
THERE WAS NO ECONOMIC NECESSITY FOR HIM TO EXHIBIT AND SELL HIS WORKS
WE'VE GOT ONE OR TWO SMALL DARK HOLES WITH THIS
HE SIMPLY PAINTED BECAUSE HE LOVED
BUT LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT ANYWAY
NINETY SEVEN POS WENT TO THE MAESTRO COLIN
THEY MAY NEED A MIRACLE
ONLY TIME WILL TELL
CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST
WHEN IT STARTED RAINING
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME
ON HOLIDAY IN THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS
IT'S THE MARY PORTAS HAIRY TORTOISE
BUT MAYBE HE CAN TELL US ABOUT
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
I BURIED MY MUM LAST WEEK
SHE WAS FURIOUS
SHE HAS SUFFER KNOW
THE PRINCE OF WALES FAMOUSLY HAD HIS FIRST MARITAL TIFF AFTER ABOUT SIX MINUTES
NO MOON IN THE MORNING
GREAT BIG MOON POST IT NOTES
FULL OF EXTREMELY HUNGRY PEOPLE
IT'S A FEELING I SHARE
BUT THAT ALSO MEANS
BECAUSE THE SUN WILL MOST DEFINITELY HAVE HIS HAT ON
EACH HAVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER WITH SOME GREAT NAMES
THERE'S THE ISLAND OF OAK
BUT HOW MUCH LONGER CAN THIS PRECIOUS RESOURCE MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR GROWING POPULATION
JOHN HAS BEEN TO INVESTIGATE
WHEN WE GET VERY DRY SUMMERS AND DRY WINTERS
EVERY SINGLE YEAR
TAKING EVEN MORE RAINWATER OUT OF THE ENVIRONMENT SIMPLY ISN'T AN OPTION
WHAT CAN BE DONE TO AVERT A SERIOUS CRISIS
COME AND ENJOY IT
THE IDEA OF RUNNING OUT OF DRINKING WATER SEEMED UNIMAGINABLE
IT'S THE QUALITY
ONE IS A NEGATIVE ONE WHERE WE CONTINUE USING MORE WATER
THERE IS MORE PRESSURE ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE
WE HAVE TO BUILD MORE INFRASTRUCTURE
THINGS GET WORSE AND WORSE
AND WE END UP IN A WATER CRISIS
AND THEY ARE ALREADY STARTING TO DO THIS
BRUSHING YOUR TEETH
THAT KIND OF THING
A HOUSE NOW STANDS WHERE THE MONASTERY USED TO BE
NOW YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT ADAM WAS ASKED TO BE A JUDGE AT THIS YEAR'S BBC FOOD AND FARMING AWARDS
HIS CATEGORY WAS
FARMER OF THE YEAR
AND THEY WERE LOST BECAUSE OF PIPE WATER COMING IN
WHICH RECOGNISES EXCEPTIONAL FARMING PRACTICE
WHO IS A LOVELY
WE FOUND OUT THAT OUR HERD HAS BEEN STRUCK DOWN WITH THE DISEASE AGAIN
WHICH MEANS THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE IT BAD ENOUGH TO BE SLAUGHTERED BUT SHE HAS TO BE ISOLATED AND
AND THAT HIGHLAND HAER
DEPENDING ON WHAT IT IS
SO THEY'RE PROBABLY OK FOR ANOTHER TWO DEGREES BUT ONCE IT GETS BEYOND THAT POINT THEN WE REALLY
IT'S THE SAME AS LOOSE WOMEN
I'M NOT ONE TO GET INTO PETTY DISPUTES OR HOLD A GRUDGE
WELCOME TO THE NEWS AT TEN
SAID TO ME TODAY
IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS
I'LL GET HIM HOT
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY
WE DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY
CAN WE FORGET ABOUT THE PRICE TAG
BUT THE QUESTION THAT REMAINS IS THIS
THE REAL WORLD IN YOUR DREAM
IT'S CALLED I'M A GENUINE CELEBRITY
I SHOULD EXPLAIN
THAT'S ALL FOR TONIGHT
THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROMISED THOSE COMMUNITIES DESTROYED BY THE RIOTS THAT THE BBC WILL MAKE A DRAMA
BUT YOUR SHOP IS A BLOODY DISASTER
IT WASN'T THAT LOUD
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE RUN AWAY
THIS IS A BACKWARD FARMING COMMUNITY
BUT TO HELP US FIT IN
BUT MAYBE NOT JUST YET
THERE ARE LOTS OF US WHO WOULD LOVE TO THINK THAT WE COULD JUST LET OURSELVES GO IN ANY SOCIETY
AND KIDS ARE VERY THEY SEE THE TRUTH VERY
YOU HAD THE BBC REP COMPANY DOING RELIGIOUS STORIES
WAS MY BODY
THIS SORT OF MIXTURE OF SENSITIVITY AND INTELLIGENCE
I WOULD COME HOME IN THE EVENINGS AND SIT AND LOOK AT THE FIRE
WITH BIG STARING EYES
BRIAN BLESSED IS ONE OF OUR BEST LOVED ACTORS AND HE IS A MAN WITH A TASTE FOR ADVENTURE
THAT MEANT TWENTY FOUR MILLION
OR TWENTY EIGHT MILLION VIEWERS
JAMES BOND WAS ON
FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE AND
I WAS AUGUSTUS CAESAR
FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM
THE ONE THAT EXPRESSES DOUBT
THAT HE WOULD TAKE ALL THE SINS OF THE WORLD ON HIS SHOULDER
NOW IF I GO UP BUT AT THE END OF THIS LINE OR DOWN
SUB HE IS A PERFORMER
BECAUSE THEY WERE USING THEATRE ACTORS PREDOMINANTLY UM AND THEY BRING A POWER
AD LIB IF THINGS WENT WRONG
SO THAT WE COULD RECORD HIS FIRST SIGHT OF THE MOUNTAIN
SO I WAS TRYING TO RECREATE
THRILLED TO GO AND MEET HIM
A DOCTOR CAME TO INJECT ME
FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
I JUST SAID I I'M JUST IN THIS AREA HELLO I DIDN'T EVEN SAY TO THE BOY
QUITE THE CONTRARY
AND HIS GREAT MOUNTAINEER FRIENDS
ATTRIBUTE TO THEIR GREAT IDEALS
THAT IT ACTUALLY OVERSHADOWS THE REST OF YOUR CAREER
AND IT OVERSHADOWS THE DECISIONS OF CASTING DIRECTORS
AND I THINK THAT PROBABLY DID HAPPEN WITH FLASH GORDON
IT WAS SUCH A PERFECT ROLE THAT I THINK THAT AFTER THAT WHICH
AND THAT I BELIEVE
EVEN THE PERSON WHO DESPISES THE COMMERCIAL SIDE A CHRISTMAS
BUT WE ARE SAVED BY THIS SINGLE ACT OF COLOSSAL BRAVERY
HE PROBABLY WILL CLIMB EVEREST
HE PROBABLY WILL BE ON THE FIRST SPACE MISSION TO MARS
BUT WHATEVER HE DOES
THE MONSTERS ON BOARD
THAT IS ONE OF THOSE
BUT I THINK THE OPPOSITE
AND ALONG THE WAY
WHEN THE GREATEST SURGE ON RECORD HAPPENED IN THE NORTH SEA
WHICH WAS QUITE CONSIDERABLE
HE WAS THE SORT OF PRINCE OF DUSTMEN IN LONDON
WE'RE ABOUT TO GO HEAD TO HEAD
IT'S BASICALLY ONE BIG BARRIER STRETCHING FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY METRES ACROSS THE TE
AH FROM ABOUT OCTOBER
BUT WE COME INTO WHAT WE DESCRIBE AS OUR TIDAL FLOOD SEASON AND THAT'S WHEN WE START TO SEE THESE
IT'S A COMBINATION OF NORMAL WEATHER FORECASTING EQUIPMENT
FROM OUR WORK WITH THE MET OFFICE
WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE THIS PERIOD OF LOW PRESSURE
EVEN JUST TO PROTECT LONDON FROM THE TIDES AND SURGES WE SEE TODAY
THAT THE THAMES BARRIER NOT ONLY PROTECTS THEM FROM FLOODING BUT IT PROVIDES US WITH A VERY
BECAUSE ONCE WE GO INTO THE NEXT CENTURY
WHEN HE WROTE THAT SONG
I LOVE DOING THAT
THIS USED TO BE A MARSH ANYWAY
HE IS BASICALLY SAYING
THIS IS JUST A HAPPY
BUT IT WAS BRILLIANT
WHICH IS THE STRAND
AND THE THIRD STAGE
WHICH WE'LL SEE IN A MOMENT
THIS IS THE REGISTER PLATE
REPLACED BY ROLLING HILLS AND OPEN FIELDS
THAT RUNS ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL HERE
AND SO PEOPLE HAVE OPTIONS ON COMING TO THIS AREA
WHICH THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO LAND
GREAT VIEWS LOOKING BACK TO SOUTHEND ON SEA
FIND THE WATER QUALITY IS A VERY HIGH STANDARD
YOU KNOW BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T NEED TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE THIRTY TWO CRITERIA ALL THEY NEED TO KNOW IS THAT IT'S IT'S
KNOW NOT TOO FAR AWAY FROM LONDON
BLUE FLAG WILL NEED TO ADHERE TO FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE WATER QUALITY STANDARD IS TWICE AS STRINGENT AS WE HAVE NOW
ALTHOUGH WATER QUALITY IS CONSTANTLY IMPROVING
WE MAY ACTUALLY SEE A VERY SLIGHT FALL IN BLUE FLAGS FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN ONWARDS
SIMPLY BECAUSE THE TARGET AND THE STANDARDS HAVE ACTUALLY MOVED ON NOT BECAUSE ANYTHING'S CHANGING
WATCHING A CHILD SUFFER IN HOSPITAL
AWAY FROM FAMILIAR FACES AND SURROUNDINGS
UM WITH YOUR DONATION
THEY COULD MAKE THAT HAPPEN
IF THE LINES ARE BUSY
FRANKINCENSE AND ME
FROM THE WORD GO
WHEN I HAD MY FIRST DONKEY
I'M GLAD TO SAY
FRANKINCENSE AND MYRRH WERE TAKEN TO BETHLEHEM FROM THE EAST
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF ENGLAND
SO I'M SURE IF WE LOOK AROUND THE TREES
WE WILL FIND SOME BITS AND PIECES THAT MIGHT BE SIMILAR
I STILL GOT TO FIND A THIRD
AND THAT IS GOLD
WHEN IT COMES TO CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS
THE LIST IS POTENTIALLY ENDLESS
ARE THE CUS BECAUSE THE CHANCES ARE
FRANKINCENSE AND MYRRH
EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO BUY EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE
THE AGRICULTURE WAS OVER
MEAN PRETTY LITTLE SHEEP
ONE TO THE OTHER
WHEN I WAS SMALL
WE USED TO HAVE THEM WITH SALT
ACTUALLY IF WE WERE TO RELY ENTIRELY ON INDIGENOUS PLANTS
WE'D NOT ONLY BE HUNGRY
MANY PLANTS HAVE COME INTO THIS COUNTRY AND THAT'S WHERE MOST OF OUR VEGETABLES COME FROM
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LIKE KALE
THIS IS GARDEN ORGANIC IN RITON NEAR COVENTRY AND IT'S A CHARITY DEDICATED TO THE CRAFT OF
SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE
I WAS HOOKED ON WHAT MADE THESE THINGS GROW
EVERYBODY WANTS YOU TO FAIL
THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE IT
BUT AFTER A WHILE
WHAT MORE CAN A MAN ASK
I THINK THEY WERE FOR VISITORS THAT WENT TO BROOKNS
NO I SHOULD HAVE DONE
SO IN THE MORNING I PHONED UP AND I SAID
YOU'VE JUST SEEN THE ITEMS
THIS BELONGS TO JEAN
YOUR GLASS DOME IS JUST ABOUT TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER
YOU HAD A WORD WITH HIM
I HAVE SEEN SOME DOMES IN MY TIME
AMONG MANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS
YOU'LL SEE A SENTENCE WRITTEN OUT
SHOWING HOW THE HEAD WORD
I GUESS AT THAT TIME
BUT LOOKING AT THE BACK
SO PUT THE TWO TOGETHER
WE'D LOVE TO SEE YOU
BEAUTIFUL QUALITY ON THE HEAD SO
THEY ALWAYS WERE
HOW DOES THAT WORK
WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE REST OF THEM
I'M SURPRISED THAT SHE WOULD MAINTAIN BALANCE
WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT IT
VERY HAPPY
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO FALL INTO THAT DEPRESSING STATISTIC
WE'VE GOT THE ANSWER TO ALL YOUR PROBLEMS
A PARTY OUT OF CONTROL
A CHANCELLOR IN OPEN REBELLION AND THE LOWEST POPULARITY RATINGS SINCE RECORDS
AND THE TROUBLES AREN'T OVER YET FOR THE RESIDENT OF NUMBER TEN
ONE THING'S FOR SURE
THIS PRIME MINISTER ISN'T GIVING UP JUST YET
THE WHOLE THING WAS VERY UPSETTING
NO WONDER THAT SHE TALK FUNNY
BUT I NO EAT THE ENGLISH FOOD
ALL FRY IN A VERY LOT OF FAT
I THINK IS QUICKER THAN THE GUN
I AM NOT A CRAZY MAN
THEY VAMPIRE PEOPLE
THAT'S THE MAIN HEADLINES
NOW LET'S GO OVER TO THE NEWS WHERE YOU ARE
LOADS OF YOUNG STUFF
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT
ANOTHER SERIES OF AN IDIOT ABROAD DONE
IT'S CALLED AN INTELLECTUAL ABROAD
ALL EYES ARE ON THE BUILDING BEHIND ME
WHERE THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS NEW CABINET ARE FACING PROBLEMS OF TRULY BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS
THEY MAY NEED A MIRACLE
ONLY TIME WILL TELL
CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST
IT'S A CLASSIC FOOD PAIRING
THAT'S AN HOUR AND A HALF IN ALL
AGAIN LEAVE ONE SIXTY CENTIGRADE ON A FAN OVEN
BRING THE VENUE TO THE TREES
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP CANAPES
BROUGHT THEM TO THE BOIL
TEAR THE HAMS OUT
AND THIS WILL BE THE FIRST CHRISTMAS WITHOUT YOU
AFTER I'VE BEEN THERE
YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD
WHY AREN'T YOU PROUD
HE LOVES DRESSING UP
WELL TELL PEOPLE HE'S REHEARSING
WELL I WASN'T ACTUALLY IN THE HALL AT THE TIME
JUST LIKE DADDY
THINKING ABOUT IT
WE'VE GONE BACK INTO THE DEPTHS OF TIME
AND IF WE PASTEURISED
HE JUST WASN'T GOING TO HAVE THAT
AND TO THINK IT WAS A GREAT INDUSTRY AT ONE TIME
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO PUSH THE BOARD OUT
I THINK CHEFS OVER THE YEARS HAVE ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO THINK IT'S UNOBTAINABLE
SO IF YOU'VE GOT A GOAT AND YOU'VE ONLY GOT ONE OF THEM AND HE'S LOOKING A BIT MISERABLE
BUY ANOTHER ONE
BECAUSE THEY NEED A FRIEND
IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF USING YOUR EYES
YOU'VE HEARD WHAT THEY'VE HAD TO SAY
AH YOU'VE PROBABLY MADE YOUR OWN MINDS UP AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN OPINIONS
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY
LET'S GET OVER TO GRANTHAM
A LITTLE SINGLE CUP AND SAUCER LIKE THAT BUT
PUT IT INTO THE AUCTION ROOM
THAT'S MONEY IN YOUR POCKET
IF IT'S THAT RARE
NOT BECAUSE I'M NERVOUS BECAUSE IT MIGHT TURN TO BE THE EXPERT
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING
WE'RE NOW HALFWAY THROUGH OUR AUCTION
WHILE WE'RE UP HERE FILMING IN THE AREA
NO ONE KNOWS THE POTENTIAL IN HIM AS A MATHEMATICAL
AND SO IF IF YOU LIKE
WHAT HE'S KNOWN FOR IS FOR MAKING LITTLE TOYS AND HE'S KNOWN FOR BEING
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT
THERE IS THE PLAGUE
SOMEBODY IS GOING HOME WITH A LOT OF MONEY
I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS BUT I'VE GOT MY FAVOURS AND YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT YOURS
THE MAN ON THE ROSTRUM WHO'S GOT ALL THE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
AND SEE WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT ONE OR TWO OF OUR ITEMS
LET'S GO AND FIND HIM
SOMETHING FOR THE LADIES
IT BELONGS TO PAMELA
HE SAW THE VALUE IN THAT
DO JOIN US AGAIN FOR MANY MORE EPISODES TO COME
THEY WILL HAVE TO ANSWER ONE AND A HALF MINUTES OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND THEN
BIG MEN IN DRESSES
THE CLASSIC ONE IS IF IF YOU SEND A BILL BACK BECAUSE THERES SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT
AND I SHAME MYSELF
WELL I'D LOVE TO PRESENT A GAME SHOW LIKE MASTERMIND
I JUST NEED YOU TO
WE HAVE FOUR CONTENDERS AND TWO ROUNDS OF QUESTIONS
IT'S THE SPECIALIST ROUND FIRST
AND I'M VERY HAPPY
DO YOU WANT TO JUMP OUT OF A PLANE
I'M UNABLE TO SAY NO
THAT'S THE PLAN YOU KNOW
NOW VERY BATTERED
I WOULDN'T USE THIS WORD VERY OFTEN
BUT WITH A CAPITAL G
WHICH SETS HIM APART
THOSE FOUR POEMS
WHO'S THERE TO SAY
THE INTERESTING THINGS
IS THE NEED TO EAT AND SURVIVE
AND THAT'S WHERE EVERYTHING ELSE STEMS FROM
BUT I THINK HE DID MAKE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT FOOD IN A DIFFERENT WAY
BUT HE WAS AN URBANITE
STAFF BUT WHAT DOES RUNNING A STATELY PILE INVOLVE TODAY
DON'T GET INVOLVED
AFTER A HARD DAY WORKING ON THE ESTATE
I FEEL I COULD FIT RIGHT IN HERE
THAT WAS THE SKILL
AS THE DEER NUMBERS INCREASE
THE HABITAT STARTS TO BECOME AFFECTED
THEY CAN PRODUCE SPERM
ESTATES COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES AND
YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD SALT THE THE INGREDIENT FIRST
AND ALSO HIS FRIEND SKYLARK
AND THEY'RE VERY LIVELY
AND THE HOUSE AND GARDENS ATTRACT AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
DON'T FORGET THE COUNTRY FILE CALENDAR FOR TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE
YOU'LL WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER'S GOING TO BE LIKE
THE WHOLE SHEBANG
JUST BECAUSE THEY LIKE THE FEEL OF THEM
WHOEVER THEY MAY BE
THAT I AM CHANGING AND IF I STAY WITHIN MY ALLOWANCE
ALL I'M DOING IS PROVING MY FAMILY RIGHT
SOMETHING ABOUT THE PAIR OF YOU DOESN'T SMELL QUITE RIGHT
BUT YOU SORT OF SPURNED ME
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO UPSET THINGS IT' JUST
I'M NOT A CHIEF INSPECTOR ANYMORE
I DON'T MEAN YOU ANY HARM
I DON'T THINK SO
IT WILL SOUND RIDICULOUS NOW
I'VE ALREADY STOOD TRIAL FOR THOSE DIAMONDS
YOU WERE TRIED FOR ILLEGALLY IMPORTING SEVENTY EIGHT DIAMONDS INTO
YOU MAY HAVE READ MY PERSONAL
THAT REMINDS ME
TONIGHT FOUR CONTENDERS WILL FACE THE ULTIMATE TELEVISION TEST OF NERVE AND KNOWLEDGE
SLEEP AT HIGH ALTITUDE
THERE'S NO GUARANTEES
WE HAVE OUR OLYMPIC TRIALS PROBABLY ABOUT SIX WEEKS BEFORE THE GAMES BEGIN
IF I COULD SING PROPERLY
YOU'RE LIKE ELVIS
BY MAKING MISTAKES
AND IF YOU ALLOW THEM TO BE DANGEROUS
DO JOIN US AGAIN FOR MORE CELEBRITY MASTERMINDS
VOICE REALLY SLIPPED THERE
UM SAY SOMETHING ELSE
WE HAVE FOUR CONTENDERS
BUT THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE WINNER
IT'S THE SPECIALIST SUBJECT ROUND FIRST
THEN GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
REALLY COVERS THE WHOLE OF THE HUMAN CONDITION
IT DOESN'T BELONG TO
SHE'D PROBABLY SAY NO
BUT AS WE KNOW NOW
THEY WERE THERE IN VARIOUS POCKETS
A GREAT TRAGEDY
THE GERMANS AND US
THAT THE FIGHTING HAD SOMEHOW BEEN GALLANT AND NOTABLE
THAT WAS OUR FIRST GO
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE TURNED OUT
THEY KNOW NOTHING OF THE BREADLINE
AND THEY DON'T DO CARBS
I NEED MORE FAGS
YOU HAVE SPENT ALL MORNING HAVING YOUR NAILS DONE
I WANT TO BE LIGHT
YOU SING RIGHT INTO THE MIC
WE COULDN'T HEAR
YOU HAVE TO PROJECT
AFTER ALL YOU SAID
I JUST MADE IT YOUR FAULT BECAUSE I
I'M JOHN HUMPHRIES AND WELCOME TO CELEBRITY MASTERMIND
AND TWO MINUTES ON GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
THE HONOUR OF BECOMING TONIGHT'S MASTERMIND
AND THEY WILL ALSO GO HOME
AND IT'S A BIT OF AN IRRITANT
I THINK IT'S BRITAIN'S OLDEST
IT'S NOT LIKE THROWING A POT
BUT NOW WE'RE BACK
AND LIKE WITH ACTING
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCH THEM SO
AND IT'S ABOUT THE WARRING SONS NOW
THAT WOULDN'T FIT INTO A MODERN SETTING IN THIS COUNTRY
IT WAS VERY MUCH BORN OF AN ERA VERY SIMILAR TO NOW
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
I'M JOHN HUMPHRIES
TONIGHT FOUR MORE CONTENDERS WILL ANSWER A MINUTE AND A HALF OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST
THEY ARE COMPETING FOR THE TITLE OF CELEBRITY MASTERMIND
THE HONOUR OF IT
IT'S ALL BUILDING BLOCKS
IF YOU NEVER GET IT WHEN NEAR AT SCHOOL
AND A LOT OF TEACHERS PUT KIDS OFF
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IT'S
IT'S NOT ABOUT NUMBERS AND TIMES TABLES
YOU MUST NEVER TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER
YOU MUST ALSO REALIS AND
AND I TRY AND REALISE THIS ABOUT MY DISABILITY
YOU EITHER SIT AT HOME AND YOU DO NOTHING
OR YOU TRY AND GET OUT THERE AND DO SOMETHING
AND THAT SEEMS TO ME NOT MUCH OF A CHOICE
WE STARTED WITH MY WIFE
NOT A CHARITY SHOP
BUT THEY MADE A MARGIN
I AM CUTTING EDGE
THE WESTERN MAIL
WHO DO YOU WORK FOR
EVERY DAY OF THE TOUR
HOW CAN YOU DO THAT AND NOW DO THIS
FIVE AND THEN THIS ONE HAD SIX
WHICH IS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY
AND BACK IN THE AUTUMN OF TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
THEY'RE UP HERE WHATEVER THE WEATHER
EXCEPT FOR ONE DAY IN AUTUMN
IT'S IT'S SOMETHING POWERFUL
YOU KNOW WHICH PONIES ARE YOURS
THE GENETICS IS IMPROVING ALL THE TIME
FIVE OUT OF FIVE
I'M JOHN HUMPHRIES AND WELCOME TO CELEBRITY MASTERMIND
TONIGHT OUR FOUR CONTENDERS WILL HAVE ONE AND A HALF MINUTES OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT
AND WHOEVER SCORES HIGHEST WILL HAVE NOT ONLY THE GREAT PRESTIGE OF BEING THE WINNER
JAWS IS BRILLIANT
YOU KNOW LET'S GET CLOSE AGAIN
AND JUST NOT BE NERVOUS
TO PURSUE MY CAREER PROFESSIONALLY
I WAS I WAS A GAME SHOW HOST
SO I CAME TO THE UK
DO JOIN US AGAIN FOR MORE CELEBRITY MASTERMINDS
THANKS FOR WATCHING
I'M JOHN HUMPHRIES AND WELCOME TO CELEBRITY MASTERMIND
WE'RE JOINED BY FOUR CONTENDERS WHO WILL EACH FACE TWO VIGOROUS QUESTION AND ANSWER ROUNDS
BEFORE WE FIND OUT WHO
THERE IS ONE AND A HALF MINUTES OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND THEN TWO MINUTES ON
THE ARCHERS FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY TO THE PRESENT DAY
I WANT TO ACTUALLY TAKE THIS ISSUE
WHAT DO YOU MISS MOST OUT OF POLITICS
BECAUSE YOU WERE THERE FOR QUITE A LONG TIME AND YOU ROSE TO A VERY HIGH OFFICE
HOW CAN I PUT IT
I MISS SOME OF THE COMRADESHIP OF PEOPLE
SOME OF THE PEOPLE
I WAS THERE IN PARLIAMENT WITH
I DIDN'T VOTE FOR THEM AND THE SOONER THEY ARE NOT THE GOVERNMENT ANY MORE THE BETTER
THANKS ALL VERY MUCH INDEED FOR WATCHING
DO JOIN US AGAIN FOR MORE CELEBRITY MASTERMIND
YOU LOVE THAT MOVIE
MR SANDERSON IS A SOLID
LET HIM DO HIS SPITE
LITTLE SNARKY COMMENTS ALONG THE SIDE
A HUGE BLOKE PUSHED IN FRONT OF ME
TOOK ON A MACHINE GUN NEST SINGLE HANDEDLY
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT NOTHING IS GOING TO MATTER
IT'S NOT GOING TO MATTER THAT I'VE WON AWARDS OR DONE SHAKESPEARE OR COMIC RELIEF OR SLIPP IN THE
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING
WE JUST FORGET THAT
THE WOODLAND TRUST ARE PLANTING SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
THAT WILL CREATE THE FOREST
ALONG THE EDGES
WE WANT TO CREATE WOODLAND EDGE HABITAT
FRANCIS BACON WROTE
NOT JUST FOR PURPOSE
HATFIELD HOUSE IN HERTFORDSHIRE IS
A FINE EXAMPLE OF THIS NEW PASSION FOR THE AESTHETIC
ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
IN A KNOT GARDEN LIKE THIS ONE AT HATPFIELD
NO FLOWERS IN THIS PART
IT'S VERY CLEVER OF FORSTER TO MAKE THIS THIS HAPPEN
AND THAT LEAVES THE WAY OPEN FOR A DISCUSSION OF EXACTLY WHAT HE'S TRYING TO CONNECT
WHETHER IT'S AT AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL
THE HOUSE THAT CONNECTS ALL THE CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK
A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COUNTRY
BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT
AND A SENSE TOO THAT THE WORLD IS CHANGING VERY RAPIDLY
THE BOOK ENDS ON AN OPTIMISTIC NOTE
SPRING HAS ARRIVED
DON'T WAIT FOR THE MUSE TO ARRIVE
SUCKING YOUR PENCIL
SHE WAS SOLD OVER A BILLION COPIES
A THOUSAND MILLION BOOKS IN HER LIFETIME
IT'S UP THERE WITH THE BIBLE
MY MOTHER WROTE ALL HER WONDERFUL BOOKS
I'M NEVER GOING TO WRITE A BOOK WITH AN UNHAPPY ENDING
VERY IMPORTANT TO HER
IT'S BARBARA CARTLAND'S FIRST ROMANTIC NOVEL
IT WAS EARLY APRIL
BUT A NEWCOMER HAS ARRIVED
THE GREY SQUIRREL HAS DOMINATED THE SPECIES
SHE BECAME A SUFFRAGETTE
WHICH WAS THE MILITANT ARM OF THE SUFFRAGETTES
RATHER THAN THE SUFFRAGISTS WHO HELD MEETINGS AND RALLIES AND LECTURES
SHE WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE ONE OF THE ORDINARY SUFFRAGETTES
BUT AS AN ARISTOCRATIC LADY SHE HAD A MEDICAL CHECK
SHE TOOK HERSELF OFF TO LIVERPOOL
JOINED A DEMONSTRATION THERE
AND SHE SUFFERED THAT EIGHT TIMES BEFORE THEY RUMBLED HER AND REALISED SHE WASN'T WHO SHE SAID SHE WAS
AND I CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE A FEMINIST
BUT IN FACT ONLY THE HIGHEST STATUS PRISONERS EVER GOT SENT TO THE TOWER
UNTIL THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
THE IDEA OF PRISON AS PUNISHMENT WAS QUITE UNUSUAL
AND THEY WERE BEATEN TO DEATH
IN THIS CONTEXT
AND NEW KINDS OF PRISONS WERE ENCOURAGED
BUT THE DOCUMENTARY MADE ABOUT MOORE WAS REALLY QUITE IN DEPTH
WAS THAT TYPICAL OF HIS CHARACTER
YOU'D HAVE TO SAY
BUT IS THAT A PROMISE IT CAN KEEP
JOHN HAS BEEN TO MEET THE PRIME MINISTER
BUT FOR EVERY ONE PERCENT INCREASE IN FUEL BILLS
THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS SLIDE INTO FUEL POVERTY
I THINK IT'S NOT A MARKET THAT'S YET FUNCTIONING AS WELL AS I WOULD LIKE
IT'S A GREAT MISTAKE TO HAVE ALL YOUR ENERGY COMING FROM ONE SOURCE OR FROM ONE OFTEN DANGEROUS
AND I THINK IT'S RIGHT WE INVEST IN RENEWABLES
I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR
THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS
AND I THINK WE CAN HOLD OUR HEADS UP
THIS COUNTRY NEEDS MORE HOUSING
I WOULD NO MORE PUT THAT AT RISK THAN I WOULD PUT AT RISK MY OWN FAMILY
BUT WE WOULD LIKE
THIRTY EXTRA HOUSES AND WE'D LIKE THEM BUILT IN THIS WAY
WITH ONE INSTRUMENT
PEOPLE DON'T LOOK HARD ENOUGH OFTEN BUT
I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
AND HOWARD'S BEEN WORKING WITH ME
WHEN I DRIVE PAST
I'LL SEE IF I CAN WORK HER
ELLIE IS ON A MISSION TO MAKE THE PERFECT YORKSHIRE PUD
IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON HEADING OUT AND ABOUT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE IN THE WEEK AHEAD
LIKE IN THE DAY BEFORE THEY HAD HIGHLY REFINED PLAIN FLOUR
WE NEED TO SEE THOSE SAILS TURNING
AND THAT ARRIVED
IF IT'S QUITE GASSY LIKE
WOULD YOU NAME EXTRA SOLAR PLANETS
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT
THE FIRST THING I THINK
WE HAVE A LOT OF CANDIDATES AND WE GO THROUGH A LOT OF PROCESSING TO MAKE THEM ANNOUNCEMENTS BUT
THE RED STAR IS SMALL
IT'S SOMETHING LIKE ASKING DARWIN
THOSE DIFFERENCES TELL YOU ABOUT THEIR FORMATION
IN THE MEANTIME
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OTHER EVENTS
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME
IT'S A DEMOCRATIC DISH
FOUR HUNDRED DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
SO BEFORE THAT
THERE'S SO MANY HAPPY MEMORIES ON BRITANNIA
AND THE SAUCE IS REALLY CLASSICAL
SOME GARLIC AND GOING COOK IT IN OIL
WE'RE IN NORTH WALES
AND WE'VE GOT VERY SIMILAR INTERESTS
WE DON'T ARGUE AMONGST EACH OTHER VERY MUCH
AND MOST OF THE TIME
I WOULDN'T BUY THEM MYSELF
NEVER GOING TO BE A PROBLEM
IF WE LOOK AT THAT
BUT I'M LOOKING TO FOLLOW UP THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY
YOU'RE ABLE TO MAKE IT DINNER
I FIND THAT IN TODAY'S MARKET
THERE'S A FLUTTER
THE BIG IDEA IS IT'LL JUST BE ME
JUST ME ALONE ON MY TODD
THAT LASTED FOR ABOUT FIVE SECONDS
I'VE JUST HAD SOMEBODY ON THE BLOWER
I'M WORTH AT LEAST A MILLION
AH COOPER SINCE COOPER
WE'VE BEEN MORE THAN GENEROUS
I PEE STANDING UP
I DIDN'T SAY THAT NOW
RIGHT LET'S GO AND MEET THE JOLLY OLD TEAMS
PEOPLE LIKE THINGS TO STORE THINGS IN
I'M HEADING OFF TO EASTER CASTLE
I DON'T THINK SO
IT'S WELL THUMBED
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT ANYWAY
MINUS TEN POUNDS ON THAT
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE PLUS SIX
BUT NICE STAR DESIGN
THAT COULD BE A WINNING SCORE
AND THEN I READ ABOUT TRUFFLES
YOU REALLY WANT TO SAY
AN HOUR FOR MEDIUM RARE
AND BEYOND THAT YOU KNOW
TWO HUNDRED DEGREES CELSIUS
WHEN THEY COME UP
IT'S CHARMING AND IT'S GREEN
BUT FROM A SUBSTANTIALLY EARLIER PERIOD
I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID WINE
BECAUSE I THINK THAT GIVES A BIT MORE OF A CHANCE OF SELLING
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH
THAT IT MIGHT NOT TAKE OFF
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
POSSIBLY CHESTER AND WE LIKE CHESTER SILVER DON'T WE IN THIS ROOM
SEVERAL COMMISSIONS LEFT ON THIS
WHAT YOU DO IS TO WALK AWAY WITH PLUS TWENTY SEVEN PO
FIVE ANYWHERE ELSE
YOU ARE MINUS FOURTEEN PO
IT'S A GOOD LOT FOR SOMEBODY
JUST AS WELL YOU DIDN'T GO WITH IT
WHAT MAY WE SAY FOR IT
THE BLACKDOWN HILLS IS SCATTERED WITH SMALL VILLAGES AND MOSTLY DAIRY FARMS ALL SURROUNDED BY
AND FOR MY SINS
LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A MARKET WHICH HAS GONE FROM A VERY SMALL MARKET TO A ONE AND A HALF BILLION POUND
AND WITHIN THAT
I'VE TAKEN A LOT OF WHAT I'VE LEARNT AND TAKEN THAT FORWARD INTO THE WAY I'M FARMING NOW
AND HOW DO THEY STACK UP
THAT'S WHAT I'LL BE ASKING WHEN I CONTINUE THIS INVESTIGATION IN A FEW MINUTES' TIME
BECAUSE NINETY PERCENT OF YOUR RESPONDENTS SAID THAT THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT ANIMAL WELFARE
GIVING ANIMALS A NATURAL
AND SOMETHING HAS TO KEEP IT COOL WHILE IT'S ON THE DOORSTEP
I THINK THEY'VE GOT THE SEEDS OF A VERY GOOD IDEA THERE
AND WE NOW SELL TWENTY FIVE
OF SOMETHING AND THE FACT THAT IT'S WELL MADE AND IT'S EICALLY MADE
SO OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME
IN THE LONGER TERM WE
THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE
WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY BE FARMING IN A MORE ORGANIC WAY
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF HEALTH
AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED LOWER LEVELS OF CADMIUM
IN ORGANIC WHEAT
THAT WOULD BE MADE INTO BREAD
COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL WHEAT
ORGANIC FARMING INCLUDED
BUT THEY DON'T SEE AS WELL TOP AND BOTTOM
SO IF SOMETHING WAS JUMPING OUT OF A TREE
AND IF YOU'RE PLANNING A FEBRUARY PICNIC
AND QUITE FRANKLY
LET'S TRY THIS AND TRY THAT
WE'LL BE ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT
WHERE MATT WILL BE MEETING THE COUPLES WHO MET WHILE SPEED DATE WALKING
BUT I THINK IT'S TWENTY QUI
WE'VE WE'VE GOT AGREEMENT
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT
WHIPPED OUT AN ANTIQUE GUN
TO BE WITH OUR AUCTIONEER TODAY
BECAUSE YOU STARTED OFF MAKING GOOD PROFITS
ABOUT FORTY ONE YEARS AGO
WE SHOULD GO ON THAT WE
I JUST DECIDED TO DO IT AND HE HAD NO IDEA
I THINK WE REALLY LIKE HIM FOR TWENTY FIVE
HE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS
TO A COLLECTOR OF OF THAT MILITARY BACKGROUND
WHEN I FIRST SAW IT
SO I'M GOING TO BE QUITE STRONG
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE FUSSED
SO WE PUT A GUIDE PRICE ON IT OF ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY
THE BIG QUESTION IS TODAY
BUT I MUST SAY I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT FITTING MYSELF
I CAN SEE THAT MAKING A LOT OF MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME
AND I USED TO DO TRIATHLONS WHEN I LIVED IN SAN DIEGO
WHERE ARE THE ALL DIVS
SOME OF MY PAINTINGS HAVE GONE ABROAD
IT'S TIME TO STOP THE SHOP TIME
YOU'RE STILL PLUS TWENTY FIVE
A SPLENDID CAN
AMONGST OTHER THINGS BUT
BUT DON'T LET THAT PUT YOU OFF
I MUST TELL YOU ABOUT THE BONUS BAR
WE'RE IN IT FOR THE
JONATHAN PAID SIXTY
THEY MAY BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE A GO AT THE BONUS BUY
SO THAT'S PRETTY WELL ON THE BUTTON
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VIEWERS AT HOME
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT THE COLLECTION OF POSTCARDS
FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT THE WORCESTER FIGURES
THEY ARE EXTREMELY WHITE TIM
PARTICULARLY LATE ONES LIKE THIS
HIS PARENTS OWNED THE LOCAL POST OFFICE WHEN I WAS A CHILD
THAT WAS FANTASTIC
WAS TO MAKE MARMALADE
YOU RARELY GET A COLLECTION OF THESE AT AUCTION
THE OTHER THING IS
THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT
AT LEAST FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT THE OLD FISH CASE
YOU ARE PLUS FORTY ONE
I DID A DREADFUL DEED TO MY BROTHER
I WANT SOMETHING SORT OF SMALL
GET SET OFF
YOU KNOW ABOUT AUCTIONS
FORTY COUNTRIES WERE EXHIBITING
WHICH IS EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE
I'VE GOT ONE AT HOME
ONE BEST MATES WITH HER BOYFRIEND
WHO LOOKS BEST ON CAMERA
THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY NOT SPENT BY THE TEAMS IS GIVEN TO THE EXPERT
MORE OF THAT LATER
AND MAYBE EVEN A HARD LIQUOR OF SOME SORT
I THINK IT'S LOVELY
WHAT I LIKE ALSO
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THEM WHICH IS WHICH MAKES US FEEL UNEASY
THEY SEEM INHERENTLY UNSAFE
SO WE ACTUALLY TAKE A LOT MORE CARE ABOUT HOW WE USE THEM
YOUNG DRIVERS LIVING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE ARE THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO BE KILLED OR
WHY ARE THE RISKS ON COUNTRY ROADS SO MUCH GREATER
TWENTY MILES AN HOUR
I COULDN'T SEE THAT
BEING IN JAIL AWAY FROM HIS FAMILY AND SUPPORT NETWORK
WAS GOING TO HELP HIM
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY
I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THAT
BUT I HAVE OBSERVED A LOT OF CARELESS DRIVING
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IS THE ACTUAL LACK OF DRIVING EXPERIENCE
AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT
THE RISKIEST TIME FOR ANY NEW DRIVER IS DURING THE FIRST YEAR AFTER THEY'VE PASSED THE TEST
WE'VE REDUCED THAT BY BY FIFTY
WE CAN DO THAT FOR THEM
THEN AFTER YOU GET YOUR LICENCE
YOU WOULD HAVE A RESTRICTED LICENCE FOR THE FIRST YEAR
AND THERE WOULD BE RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS
ZERO TOLERANCE DRINK DRIVE LIMIT
SO THE IDEA OF REDUCING FROM SIXTY TO FIFTY EVERYWHERE
AFTER MORNING SERVICES
IT'S ALL BEEN ABOUT SERVICE
IT'S ALSO A GIFT
WHICH SO MANY PEOPLE JUST DON'T HAVE
A SENSE OF PURPOSE
OIL SEA DRE AND BARLEY
WE GREW ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED ACRES OF MOTING BARLEY FOR MAKING BEER
SOME OF THAT IS ABOUT TO START AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY
UM NEVER REALLY KNOW WHERE IT ENDS UP
WE STARTED TO TALK NEAR THE END AND THE WALK FINISHED
ELLIE WILL BE IN ENNERDALE
SO THAT MEANS THAT IMAGES ARE FOUND
AND SOME OF THAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE UK
AND I WENT TO THE RUDFORD APPLETON LABORATORY IN OXFORDSHIRE TO FIND OUT MORE
AND IT'S CALLED THE WISE SATELLITE
THAT'S BEEN LOOKING AT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS AND I WENT TO SPEAK TO ONE OF THE LEAD
AND IT'S A NEW CLASS OF BROWN DWARF THAT IS ACTUALLY ROOM TEMPERATURE
AS THEY COLLAPSE AND OUT OF A CLOUD OF GAS AND DUST
WHICH THEN STARTS TO SHINE OF ITS OWN ACCORD THROUGH FUSION
I'M VERY OPEN MINDED
LOOK THERE'S THE ASTON LIGHT
A PLACE WITH A HECK OF A LOT OF HISTORY
WHAT YOU'D DO IS TO ADJUST THE POSITION OF THE STYLUS UP AND DOWN THE
KEEP YOUR EYE OPEN
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT
YOU LOATHE ONE THING
THE FIRE GAVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY
THIS ALWAYS FASCINATED ME
OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE THOSE MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO
AND ENORMOUSLY WIDE
THERE WAS CATTLE AND THERE WAS SHEEP
KING ARTHUR WAS SUPPOSEDLY CONCEIVED HERE
AND WHEN THEY'VE COME TO REST HERE
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER
MY DOCTOR TOLD ME IF YOU SPEND SIX MONTHS UNDERGROUND
BUT WHAT ABOUT PAPER
EVEN INDIGESTION REMEDIES
NO ELECTRICITY INVOLVED
THEY PRODUCED WHAT WE NOW KNOW TODAY AS MARMALADE
AS THEY'RE CALLED
A WOMAN'S JOB THEN TO COME ALONG AND COVER ALL THE PORTS
I FOUND IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP WITH MY FRIENDS IN THE CLASSROOM
SPELLING IT BAFFLED ME
FOR MANY PARENTS
FOR BETTER OR WORSE
VERY SMALL QUANTITIES
IT CAN BE THE TURNING POINT
BUT HE'S STARTING
ENABLING THEM TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILD MORE EFFECTIVELY
BUT TO CHANGE THE LIVES OF MORE CHILDREN
THE CHARITY NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT
PLEASE KEEP TRYING
IF YOU WENT CAME HERE TWENTY
AS JULIA DISCOVERED WHEN SHE VISITED THE WILD RIVER WYE
AND MOST OF THE CREDIT IS GIVEN TO THIS GUIDEBOOK
HE SAYS IN THE BOOK
WE WERE INFORMED
OBSERVATIONS ON THE RIVER WIDE
THE WHOLE OF THIS INFORMATION WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE FOUND TRUE IF THE WEATHER HAD PERMITTED US TO
YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR BODY AND YOUR MIND
WHICH I HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE
ANYONE CAN HAVE A GO
THERE'S ONE LAST PLACE I HAVE TO VISIT
DOWN THERE AT THE HEAD OF THE LAKE
THE BIRTHPLACE OF A TRUE POET
HERE'S THE WEATHER
I'LL BE DONNING MY SCUBA GEAR TO EXPLORE THE SCYLLA
TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO AMBIGUITY
EVEN IN THE SYNTAX
I UNDERTOOK TO TEST A PIECE OF PROTOTYPE EQUIPMENT
I JOINED THE FRIENDS AMBULANCE UNIT
AND THE ANGLO GERMANMAN AGREEMENT
ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS LATER
WHICH IS NECESSARY
BUT I PERSUADED THE POWERS THAT BE TO LET US HAVE A LITTLE MEANDER
WE' BETTER NIP OFF QUICK AND HAVE A LOOK AT THEIR BONUS BUY
AT THE END OF THE DAY
DIFFERENT SIGNAL BOXES
UM WHEN I WAS AT COLLEGE
IN WISCONSIN OF ALL PLACES
A LOT OF IT JUST KIND OF GOT OUT THERE
HOW THE WEATHER FORECASTING SYSTEM WORKS
IT WOULD BE WORTH ABOUT
IT COULD BE YOURS FOR EIGHTY
BECAUSE THEY WERE INTRODUCED BY BA TO GIVE THE ROOM A GEORGIAN FEEL BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY HE
AND WE'RE WITH MICHAEL ROBERTS
AND I HAVE NEVER PRESENTED
OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE THOSE MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO
MAKING THE LANDSCAPE
THE WHOLE THING
AND WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES
A LET ME REMIND YOU OF THE RULES
I LIKE MY FISHING
I LIKE THE OPEN AIR AS WELL
WE LIVE AROUND THE CORNER TO THE BEACH
IT'S A LONG WAY
YOU ARE STILL PLUS NINETY FIVE
IF THE BACTERIA MANAGES TO GET
AND THE BOOM IN DEMAND FOR CHICKEN HAS CERTAINLY ADDED TO THE PROBLEM
SO WHAT CAN BE DONE TO TRY TO STOP THE RISK
CASES OF A TYPE OF FOOD POISONING CAUSED WHERE EATING UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN ARE ON THE RISE BUT
VERY SMALL AMOUNTS
BUT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE SOME OF IT
WHERE WE NEED THE RAIN
PATCHY RAIN AND DRIZZLE
ESPECIALLY INTO WESTERN SCOTLAND
POSSIBLY EIGHTEEN DEGREES IS POSSIBLE
IF WE GET THERE
MORE OF THE SAME
STILL CLOUD COMING INTO THE WEST
BY A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE END OF THE WEEK
SUN WET WEATHER FOR A TIME
I IN THE SOUTH VARIABLE CLOUD ELSEWHERE
BUT FOR RAIN ON THE GARDENS
WE'VE HAD SOME REPORTS THAT THERE'S A NET
BUT THERE'S LOTS OF SMALLER
THANK YOU AND GOODBYE AND WE'RE ALL ON THE NEXT BOAT TO AMERICA
ON YOU HAVING TEA
I'M LYING AWAKE HALF OF EVERY NIGHT AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S ALL THESE BLOODY BANQUETS OR IF IT'S THE
I HAVE THE FORMER IN ABUNDANCE BUT
PROPOSED TO HER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PUB
I SPOTTED A DEALER WHOS DEALING IN CLUBS AND OTHER ETHNOGRAPHIC OBJECTS AND I SHOWED HIM
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
LET'S REMIND OURSELVES WHAT THE REDS BOUGHT
WE'RE HEADING OFF TO STANSTED
NOT A RUNWAY IN SIGHT
BUT APART FROM HAVING THE REPLACED GRANDEUR OF THE ROOMS AND PERIOD STYLE
YOU COULD ALSO HAVE BRAND NEW
CUTTING EDGE BITS OF TECHNOLOGY
WHAT THEY GOT WAS A SPACE
WHEN THE PLACE IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC
I BET YOU'RE LONGING TO KNOW WHAT CATHERINE BOUGHT YOU
ARE THEY GOING TO LIKE THE JADE
THE WORLD'S OLDEST SCIENTIFIC ACADEMY
AND INSIDE WAS A DOG CALLED LAIKA
SO I WENT TO MY LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY AND DISCOVERED THAT STARS WERE SUNS
THE RINGS OF SATURN
THE CRATERS OF THE MOON
THAT IS WHAT SCIENTISTS DO
LTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE MY LAB COLLEAGUES
WHEN THE VARIOUS WAYS SCIENTISTS WORK ARE COMBINED TOGETHER
THE BEDROCK FROM WHICH ALL SCIENCE FLOWS IS REPRODUCIBLE OBSERVATION AND
I WAS SEARCHING FOR GENES NEEDED FOR CELL DIVISION
BY LOOKING FOR YEAST MUTANTS WHICH COULD NOT DIVIDE
I REALISED THEY MEANT SOMETHING IMPORTANT
I DRAGGED EVERYONE IN THE LAB
I HAVE TO COME UP WITH IDEAS THAT CAN BE TESTED
THEN I THINK OF EXPERIMENTS TO TEST THE IDEA FURTHER
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE
THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WAS AMAZED AND SCEPTICAL BUT THEY DID NOT SHOUT THE CERN SCIENTISTS
HE STRUGGLED TO GET A PLACE AT UNIVERSITY
AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT
EARLY ON IN A SCIENTIFIC STUDY
BUT IT TAKES TIME
WE SEE THIS EVERY DAY IN THE NEWSPAPERS WHETHER BREAST IMPLANTS ARE SAFE OR WHAT FOODS ARE GOOD OR
PARTICULARLY AT AN EARLY STAGE IN RESEARCH WHEN KNOWLEDGE IS MORE TENTATIVE
AND HE'S ALSO A PILOT
YET SOMETIMES WE STILL NEED TO TAKE ACTION
WHEN DOCTORS FOUND I HAD BLOCKAGES IN THE ARTERIES ROUND MY HEART
ALTHOUGH THERE IS DEBATE ABOUT HOW MUCH THE TEMPERATURE WILL RISE IN THE FUTURE
OTHERS ARGUE THAT WARMING IS NOT TAKING PLACE AT ALL OR THAT IT WILL HAPPEN IN A CATASTROPHIC WAY
AS THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY PHILOSOPHER OF SCIENCE FRANCIS BACON SAID IF A MAN WILL BEGIN WITH
FIVE HUNDRED SCIENTISTS AT WORK HERE IN LONDON
AND AS ITS DIRECTOR
HE INTENDS TO MAKE IT
IN HIS OWN WORDS
THE FIRST WAR CORRESPONDENT AND A TRAILBLAZER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TELEVISION IN
AND AN AUDIENCE THAT
I HAVE VERY PERSONAL REASONS FOR DOING SO
I HAVE WANTED TO VISIT THE ANTARCTIC FOR YEARS AND BEFORE GOING
I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SERIOUS HEART DISEASE
THE SOUTH POLE HAD TO WAIT
I'M ALSO PASSIONATE ABOUT SCIENCE BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN A RESEARCHER FOR OVER FORTY YEARS AND WANT TO
WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE A SCIENTIST
HELP SOLVE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST PROBLEMS
USING OUR PHONE
BROWSING THE INTERNET
THE FOOD WE EAT
A SCIENTIST AT THE TOP OF HIS TREE
SUCH AS FEEDING THE WORLD
IN PROTECTING OUR JOBS AND INCOMES
THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY
IT BEGAN WHEN I WAS A NINE YEAR OLD BOY
AND THESE INFLUENCES HAVE DISTORTED THE SCIENTIFIC DEBATE
PUTTING VESTED INTERESTS ASIDE TO DETERMINE WHAT IS EFFECTIVE
IMPROVED SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE HAS BROUGHT REMARKABLE IMPROVEMENTS ALSO IN LIFE EXPECTANCY
WHICH CAN GENERATE A RANGE OF TISSUES IN THE BODY
POTENTIALLY REPAIRING MUSCLE AND NERVE TISSUE
WITH ALL HIS QUALITIES
THERE ARE THREATS
WHEN I WORKED IN THE UNITED STATES
I RECEIVED REGULAR HATE MAIL FROM THOSE WHO OBJECTED TO STEM CELL RESEARCH BASED ON THEIR RELIGIOUS
THERE ARE ALSO THOSE WHO CHALLENGE GOOD SCIENCE WITH MINORITY OPINIONS BASED ON WEAK
BUT NOW I WANT TO TURN TO THE ISSUE PREOCCUPYING MANY OF US TODAY
CHEMISTRY AND GEOLOGY IMPROVING CERAMICS AND THE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES
TO ILLUMINATE THEM DURING THEIR RIDE HOME AFTER DINNER
SOME SAY MICHAEL FARADAY ANSWERED THE PRIME MINISTER OF HIS DAY WHEN ASKED WHAT GOOD HIS INVENTIONS
THIS ANECDOTE CAPTURES THE VIEW OF SOME POLITICIANS AND BUSINESS LEADERS WHO FAILED TO
I STRONGLY ARGUE THAT THE FIRST REQUIREMENT IS TO HAVE A HIGH QUALITY SCIENCE BASE
WITH ALL THESE EXALTED POWERS
THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY
THE UK IS SECOND ONLY TO THE USA IN CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WORLD'S SCIENCE AND IT'S
THIS IS AN AMAZING ACHIEVEMENT FOR OUR COUNTRY
THERE IS ALSO AN INCREASING RESPECT FOR TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING IN THE UK
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT CAN NO LONGER BE IGNORED
MANY FEATURES IMPORTANT FOR GOOD SCIENCE ARE WELL EMBEDDED IN THE UK
WE HAVE A TRADITION OF RESPECT FOR EMPIRICISM
EMPHASISING RELIABLE OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT
THIS SHOULD NEVER BE UNDERESTIMATED
THE SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVOUR IS AT ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL WHEN THERE IS FREEDOM OF THOUGHT
SCIENTISTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO FREELY EXPRESS DOUBTS
TO BE SCEPTICAL ABOUT ESTABLISHED ORTHODOXY
BUT MAKING SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES AND USING SCIENCE IN INNOVATIVE WAYS IS VERY DIFFICULT
WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE
AS RESEARCH AT THE CUTTING EDGE IS NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL
OUR MEMORIES AND OUR EMOTIONAL STATES
ADVANCES WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR VIEWS ON FREE WILL
THIS IS ESSENTIAL IF WE ARE TO HAVE A SOCIETY THAT IS COMFORTABLE WITH SCIENCE AND THAT CAN
BUT THE WORK OF SCIENCE CAN ALSO REQUIRE COURAGE
FRANCIS BACON ARGUED THAT SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE GIVES US A POWER TO RELIEVE
AS IT SOMETIMES STRIKES AT THE HEART OF ACCEPTED THINKING
ALL OF WHICH NEED SCIENCE
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF SCIENCE
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SUCH THREATS
WHEN GALILEO ARGUED THAT THE EARTH ORBITED THE SUN
BETTER IRRIGATION AND THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL FERTILISERS AND PESTICIDES
LEAVING BORLAUG TO RESPOND
THEY'D NEVER EXPERIENCED THE PHYSICAL SENSATION OF HUNGER
THEY DO THEIR LOBBYING FROM COMFORTABLE OFFICE SUITES IN WASHINGTON OR BRUSSELS
AS I HAVE FOR FIFTY YEARS
THIS CAN BE HELPED THROUGH IMPROVING THE GROWTH OF CROPS
ASSISTING PLANT BREEDING AND BY THE GENETIC MODIFICATION OF PLANTS
THEY HAD BROTHERLY LOVE
THEY HAD FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE
AND WHAT DID THEY PRODUCE
ATTRACTING THE BEST MINDS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
AND COULD ALSO BE A MODEL FOR GETTING OUR ECONOMY TO WORK BETTER
BOTH FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SOURCES
THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROTECTED SCIENCE IN THE RECENT CUTS WHICH IS VERY WELCOME
THE UK SPENDS ONE POINT
AND EVEN GREATER PROBLEM IS SPEND BY INDUSTRY IN THE UK ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING PRIVATATION
THERE WAS A COLLAPSE IN SPEND ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
WE NEED A NEW ENLIGHTENMENT
THE BOARDROOM AND THE PUBLIC SERVICES
WE NEED MORE FUNDING FOR SCIENCE
WE NEED GREATER ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PUBLIC AND A SOCIETY COMFORTABLE WITH SCIENCE
WITH THE VISION TO THINK BIG
IF WE GET IT RIGHT
WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE UK OF IMPROVING THE TRANSLATION OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE
AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN
ONE OF BRITAIN'S GREATEST ASSETS
RANGING FROM DISCOVERY SCIENCE
BECAUSE THE NHS BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE
THIS CERTAINLY APPLIES TO ME
WHICH CAN ONLY BE TO THE COUNTRY'S GOOD
THE NECESSITY TO ATTRACT HIGHLY TRAINED SCIENTISTS FROM ABROAD HAS TO BE REFLECTED IN THE UK'S
WITH NEARLY ALL PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS
AND NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY SCIENCE GENERATES RELIABLE KNOWLEDGE
EVERYONE LEAVING SCHOOL SHOULD KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROLOGY
HIS FOCUS ON PRACTICAL SCIENCE AND ON COMMUNICATING THE WONDER OF SCIENCE WAS CRITICAL TO
MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE UK IS A CULTURE SHIFT TO FULLY RECOGNISE WHAT SCIENCE CAN
SOMETIMES IT IS ARGUED THAT WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ONLY ON TRANSLATION AND INNOVATION AND NOT
REVIVE THE ENERGY OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
BUT THE WORLD IS MORE COMPLEX NOW
WE HAVE BECOME MORE FOCUSED ON SPECIALIST AREAS CUT OFF FROM EACH OTHER
THERE ARE BARRIERS BETWEEN SCIENTISTS AND TECHNOLOGISTS AND ENGINEERS BLOCKING THE EXCHANGES
IT IS ESSENTIAL TO BREAKDOWN THESE BARRIERS
WITH PERMEABILITY WILL COME MORE INNOVATIVE IDEAS AND GREATER MUTUAL RESPECT
WHEN IT OPENS IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN
AS DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE
I DO NOT WANT SCIENTISTS TO STAY IN THEIR LABS
THE PUBLIC SERVICES
MURDER AND BLOODSHED
WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE HUNDREDS
WHO GATHERED THE PIECES TOGETHER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND EVENTUALLY
THEY WERE BEQUEATHED TO THE NATIONAL TRUST
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BITS OF NEEDLEWORK
OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE THOSE MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO
AND IT CAN TAKE A HUNDRED YEARS FOR IT TO REAPPEAR
NOW ALL OF THESE ADVANTAGES MEAN THAT THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE TO GROW ONE OF NATURE'S MOST
SIR HENRY PORTAL
WON A VERY LUCRATIVE CONTRACT TO BE THE SOLE SUPPLIER OF A HIGH QUALITY PRINTING PAPER
AND ALL THE TIME
AND THE GEOLOGY ACTUALLY AROUND HERE IS WHAT CREATES THAT LIFT
IT'S WONDERFUL STUFF
NOT ONLY IS IT INCREDIBLY HARD
IT CAN BE RAZOR SHARP AND
IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
LIKE ANY YOUNG BOY
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
YEAH IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN GROWING QUITE A BIT I MEAN
BUT WE SELL THE WHOLE BEAN AS WELL AS THE GROUND
I THINK WE NEED TO COME BACK
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT
OR SHOULD I SAY COFFEE
WE'RE HEADING OFF TO A CASTLE AND IT'S VERY
AND THEY WERE INDEED PUT ON DISPLAY FOR THE PUBLIC TO OGLE
WHAT MAKES IT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE JACOBITE CAUSE
SHE WILL ASSIST IN THE PREPARATION
WITH ALL DUTIES THEREBY IMPLIED
THERE WAS A MISS BUCK
I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANY BLACKLIST
SHE'S WITH CHILD
IT' ALL BE LIKE TODAY AND YESTERDAY
WE DECIDED WE WOULD SPLIT THE PRIZE IN TWO
FRANKLIN MINOR GOT THE BISCUITS
ON ANY CLEAR NIGHT
IT'S GOING THROUGH ALL THOSE GALAXIES
EVEN WITH ALL THIS SPACECRAFT
THERE ARE TWO THINGS I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER
WE'RE MORE IN NEED OF AMATEUR HELP THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN
BUT THERE'S MORE THEY CAN DO
SENDING OUT MILLIONS OF TIMES ALL LIGHT THAN THEY NORMALLY DO
IT'S IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT HOW THEY BEHAVE AND WE NEVER KNOW WHEN TO EXPECT THEM OR WHICH STAR IS
I'VE COME TO A SMALL VILLAGE IN RURAL CHESHIRE WHERE BEHIND THIS HOUSE THERE LOOKS SOMETHING
I JUST LIKE TO SEE THE STARS AT NIGHT
AND THIS IS WHERE THE AAR COMES IN
AND FROM A VERY SMALL BEGINNING
WE NOW HAVE SOMETHING LIKE TWO
AND NOT JUST IN THE EARLY DAYS
YOU CAN'T JUST GO OUT THERE AND MAKE FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERIES IN OPTICS OR
THE RAS WAS FOUNDED BY AMATEURS
BUT YOU DO NEED PATIENCE
SOME PEOPLE COME WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE CONSTELLATIONS ARE
IT'S ALL ABOUT SHARING THAT PASSION
AND WE SENT CHRIS RESULTS BACK TO SCHOOL TO FIND OUT JUST HOW THIS WORKS
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE ACCESS TO A SMALL TELESCOPE UP ON THE PLAYING FIELDS
HERE IS CRYSTAL TO TELL US MORE
IT SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY
UNTIL NEXT MONTH
THAT SEEMS CHEAP
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
IT'S A LOVELY OBJECT
I THINK YOU'RE ONTO A GOOD THING
I'M I'M BEING QUITE CAUTIOUS
YOU WIPED YOUR FACE WITH THAT
WE MET AT A POST OFFICE DOWN IN HAMPSHIRE
I WORK WITH AN ENVIRONMENTAL BUSINESS NETWORK SORT PROMOTING LOCAL SUSTAINABILITY
YOU THINK OF OUR NOU VO YOU THINK OF FRANCE
SLATER AND SMITHS WORKS
AND WHAT WAS THE END BILL FOR THE WHOLE LOT
FOR OUR TEAMS OVER AT THE AUCTION
IS IT GOING TO BE FROWNS
ONE LITTLE TWEAK ON THAT AND THAT'S
YOU SIT DOWN OVER THERE
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
LET'S REMIND OURSELVES WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
MY FAVOURITE PIECE OF THE PROGRAMME THE STATELY HOME
OVERALL WE'VE GOT SOME DIFFICULTY HERE
THEN YOU MIGHT BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH IT
AND NOT EVEN THIS
I DID MANAGE TO SEE A DOLPHIN
A BIT OF A DOLPHIN
SHES A FIVE YEAR OLD BORDER COL
IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE
I ENJOY WATCHING SPORT ON TV
IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR
I'M HERE TO HELP YOU
LET'S HOPE OUR TEAMS DON'T HIT MUCH FLATULENCE I MEAN TURBULENCE IN TODAY'S SHOW
THERE'S ONE STRATEGY
AND IF YOU CAN DO A DEAL ON TWO
THEY RANGE FROM BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY AND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED POS
AS THIS CENTRE TABLE
A STORAGE TANK THAT WOULD'VE SAT IN A VICTORIAN HOUSE
EXCEPT THE DEALER HAS TAKEN IT OUT OF THE HOUSE
EVERYTHING'S FUN ABOUT IT APART FROM THE PRICE
ANTIQUES CAN BE GREEN
AND JUST LOOK WHAT THIS CUNNING
AND IT'S ALL WORKED OUT TODAY
RIGHT NOW LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT THOMAS'S FIVEPAN
IF WE ALL MAKE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO PLANT POLLEN AND NE TO RICH PLANTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
TRY TO GET A RANGE OF FLOWER SHAPES BECAUSE THEY WILL ALL CATER FOR DIFFERENT INSECTS
WE CAN MAKE A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE
AND WE CAN'T IGNORE THAT FACT
OR IT HASN'T GOT ANY NECTAR
WITH THE DECLINE OF BEES IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD
AND I'M GOING TO GO AND HELP THEM LAUNCH IT
SO IT'S REALLY ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT
BUT IT'S ALREADY UNDER REVIEW
NOT ONLY THROUGH ALL OF THE PLANT CENTRES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
BUT ALSO ON OUR WEBSITE
EVERYBODY CAN HAVE A LOOK THERE AT ALL THE POLLINATOR FRIENDLY PLANTS
AND WE WOULD ASK
AND WE WILL AND WE'D LOVE TO INVITE YOU TO COME TO NATIONAL GARDENING WEEK NEXT YEAR
BUT ITS WOODLANDS ARE A RICH RESOURCE TOO AND I'M GETTING STUCK IN WITH THE PEOPLE WHO FIND WAYS TO
THEY'RE THE SAME SPECIES AS THE COMMON GARDEN SNAIL
THEY DON'T WANT IMPORTED FOOD
SO WHICH FOODSTUFFS ARE THE WORST
WE CAN USE ALL THE VEGETABLE PASTIALOID GREEN WASTE FROM THE LOCAL FARM
IF YOU DRINK THREE OF THESE LATTES EVERY DAY FOR A WHOLE YEAR
WHICH MEANS THAT TREES ARE A REALLY VALUABLE RESOURCE
BUT AROUND HERE
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
EARLIER WE HEARD ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF FOOD THAT HAS TO TRAVEL FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
SO OUR STANDARD WINE BOTTLE NOW IS ABOUT A THIRD LIGHTER THAN IT WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO
AND SO THEY DON'T NEED A LOT OF GRUB
SO TO GROW GOOD QUALITY CROPS
WE'VE GOT TO GO
AND I WAS RAISED ON ON RAW MILK
TRAVEL ROUND SCOTLAND
I DO TRAVEL BACK TO THE US AND
RED HOT CHILLIES
WILL THEY MAKE IT
BECAUSE THE WILLIAM MORRIS GALLERIES
REALLY PLANS FOR EXPANSION AND IMPROVEMENT TODAY
WHO WENT OUT THERE PERSUADING FOLK TO DONATE OBJECTS TO THE WILLIAM MORRIS
POUNDS IS MINUS TEN
ANY ADVANCE IN FIFTY
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A DYNAMIC DAY TODAY
DO EVERYTHING TOGETHER
IF YOU'RE KEEN ON RETRO CLOTHING
ON THE SWING DANCING SCENE
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT
IT'S CALLED FENTON HOUSE AND IT'S NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE
ON THE FACE OF IT
I FANCY IF THE DOLL DOESN'T DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY MARVELLOUS
YOU WERE DOWN THE PROVERBIAL
IT TRADE CURRENCY
WE LIKE MAHOGANY FURNITURE
WE CAN FIND A BUG
UM WALKED UP ON A FEW FROM TIME TO TIME
WE WANT YOU BACK
IT'S LOBED AND OVOID
WE'RE LIVING UP TO A RIGHT ROYAL REPUTATION TODAY
I'D BE HAPPY WITH FIVE
I LIKE THE FIRE
WHEN IN HOLLAND
I NEVER KNEW A GUNNER WHO PUT ON POWDER
IF WE ALL MAKE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO PLANT POLLEN AND NE TO RICH PLANTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
HOW GREAT FOR WILDLIFE IT IS
AND THAT'S ALL TRUE
THEY SHOULD BE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
I THINK PEOPLE IN CITIES APPRECIATE THESE FAR MORE THAN MAYBE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
WELL I THINK IT SHOULD
I'VE GOT TWO PERENNIALS AS WELL
I'D LOVE TO GIVE YOU SOME HELP
AND THEY WERE GREAT
AND WE STARTED WITH FOUR AND ONE HALF
IT'S A LOT OF BEER GOING OUT
OUR TEN BARREL BREW PLANT PRODUCING FIVE TIMES A WEEK
AND YOU CAN'T SAY
I DIDN'T SEE THAT
BECAUSE YOU'RE A SEEING PERSON
THE MAIN THING ABOUT IT IS THAT I'M CONSTANTLY STILL MAKING MISTAKES
TECHNOLOGY HAS COME ON LEAPS AND BOUNDS
I STILL USE FILM
I THINK IT TENDS TO ALLOW PEOPLE JUST TO STILL SNAP
IN THE WAY THAT THEY USED TO WITH A ROLL OF THIRTY SIX
SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY BEING
DIGITAL IS EXCELLENT
BUT ONE NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SCIENTIFIC
DEFINE THE OBJECTIVE
AND THE KEY ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY IS ACTUALLY
REALLY WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT
YOU JUST HAVE A SMALLER AREA TO WORK WITH
ONE OF THE KEYS TO CONVEY THIS DEPTH IS A GOOD
SO FOR THE NEXT LEG OF MY JOURNEY
BUT THINGS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT HERE ON THE KINTYRE PENINSULA
LIKE HAPPENED WITH A CLOTHING FACTORY HERE COUPLE OF YEARS BACK
THOUSAND PEOPLE VISITED BALLYCASTLE
COMPARED TO A MERE FRACTION OF THAT FIGURE COMING TO CAMPBELLTOWN
EXPLORE AND DEVELOP AND EXPERIENCE THAT SENSE OF INNER PEACE
THAT WAS THE WHOLE IDEA
WE'RE GETTING TOWARDS IT
SO MY LO FINE BEERS WILL HAVE TO STAY HERE
IT SURVIVED TWO WORLD WARS AND A COUPLE OF FIRES BUT LIKE THE PHOENIX RISING
I USED TO COLLECT COINS BUT ACTUALLY AFTER THE EUROPEAN UNION
THESE GUYS ARE VERY
VERY PLEASANT TO BE WITH
IF YOU WANT DRINKING PARTNERS
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
SO WE'VE GOT SOME WHOPPING GREAT GAPS HERE
YOU ARE MINUS SIXTY SEVEN
AND I KNOW HOW DEVASTATING IT CAN BE ON A PERSON'S LIFE
BUT THERE IS A CHARITY CALLED BACK UP THAT WORKS TO HELP AND SUPPORT PEOPLE AFFECTED BY A SPINAL
LITERALLY TRANSFORMING THEM
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET
AND IF YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH
PLEASE KEEP TRYING
AND I'VE SEEN THIS WITH MY OWN EYES
THEY NEED THIS WORK TO CONTINUE
AS SOMEONE WHO'S PERSONALLY HAD TO DEAL WITH SPINAL CORD INJURY
SO WHY ARE LARGE NUMBERS OF DEER BEING CULLED TO MAKE WAY FOR TREES
IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY
IT'S CLAIMED THAT RED DEER ARE RUINING EFFORTS TO INTRODUCE THOUSANDS OF NEW TREES THERE
SO WHEN IT COMES IN
AND STALKING THEM HAS CREATED A BUSINESS WORTH MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A YEAR
HOPING TO GET A STAG
WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE
I DID HEAR THE OTHER DAY
THEY'RE CULLING RED DEER TO MAKE WAY FOR NEW TREES
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT SOME PARTS OF SCOTLAND HAVE SEEN DECLINING REDIER NUMBERS
THAT'S THE GREAT LONG TERM VISION
AND YOU'LL DIB INTO IT AND THAT WILL RECOGNISE THAT YOU'VE BEEN THERE
YOU'LL BE ON YOUR OWN
IN THE FOREST OR IN THE MOUNTAINS
WHICH WAS REALLY
WHEN I FINISHED
HIS PLAN WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER
THERE'S MORE SUNSHINE
AND THEN IN ALL THE TRADITIONAL RARE BREEDS
THERE'S A WHOLE ARRAY OF COLOURS AND SHAPES AND SIZES
AND EVEN IN THE PEKIN
AND WE THINK ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTS IN THAT DIRECTION
BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT SORT OF BOOTY THAT WE'RE AFTER TODAY
I GO TO THE GYM FOUR TIMES A WEEK
THESE SELL FOR AROUND THREE HUNDRED
I'D LIKE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE POUNDS OF LEFTOVER LOLLY
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
EIGHT MONTHS LATER
THEY COULDN'T CLAIM IT
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
SO LET'S HOPE WE FIND A FEW MORE
I DIDN'T THINK THAT
SET IN ITS OWN BOTANICAL GARDENS
AND IT WAS IN WITH THE PACKAGE
AND THEN WHEN WE MOVED IN
BUT PART OF IT WAS THAT PRUSSIA WAS ALSO AT WAR WITH AUSTRIA AND THEIR PART OF THE TREATY
AUGUSTUS THIRD WHO WHO WAS IN CHARGE
I THINK IT WAS IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN NINETY S OR THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY
THEY HAVE IT FOR THREE MONTHS
SO ALREADY YOU'RE STARTING TO
AND HE AND HIS FELLOWS DIED
I HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM HOLDING IT
DON'T YOU THINK
I DON'T WANT HER TO GET THE HUMP
BUT FASCINATING THEATRE
RIDDLED WITH PROTOCOL AND REGULATIONS
OVER THE NEXT THIRTY MINUTES
TONIGHT'S TEAMS WILL HAVE THEIR SPORTING KNOWLEDGE TESTED AND STRETCHED
WE MIGHT BE UNBELIEVABLE
WE ARE STARTING THE SHOW WITH THE PICTURE BOARD
BUT MATT'S IN FRONT ON NINE
AND THIS WEEK ONE TEAM WILL READ OUT A SPORTING DEFINITION
AND IT IS FEASIBLE
OR HOWEVER YOU WOULD LIKE TO PRONOUNCE IT
FOLLOWING ON FROM THE SUCCESS OF THE ARTIST AT THE OSCARS
BUT WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF MYSTERIES IN THE STYLE OF SILENT MOVIES
AND THAT HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE AGAIN BECAUSE MATT'S ON ELEVEN
WE HAVE A WE HAVE A ROOM DEDICATED IN THE PANDA FACILITY TO DO THAT SO
BUT IF WE GET TWINS
BUT THAT DOESN'T END THERE WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE THE CHALLENGE THEN OF MAKING SURE THAT ANY INFANT BORN
IT'S DONE VERY WELL
THAT RELATIONSHIP WHERE THEY CAN JUST GET A SNAPSHOT OF EACH OTHER
YOU'LL GET INTO THE MORE TROPICAL REGIONS
LIKE THIS SPECIES HERE
THEREFORE THE PLANTS WILL TASTE DIFFERENT
IF YOU COME FURTHER SOUTH IN THE MOUNTAIN
THIS IS A GREAT OCCASION FOR SCOTLAND AND I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE TODAY
WE'VE GOT SIXTEEN VIDEO CAMERAS
SO I CAN SIT AND LOOK AT THE CAMERAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY
LAST YEAR WE SHOWED HOW COMPANIES WERE BREAKING THE BPA'S RULES
THE TRICKLE TURNED INTO A FLOOD
AND WE DIDN'T JUST CATCH YOU ON CAMERA
WE GOT YOUR BOSS TOO
PEOPLE WERE GETTING QUITE WORRIED
MEET THE BOYS FROM FIRST CALL ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES LIMITED OF DERBYSHIRE
IT TOOK THE DVLA TWO DAYS TO GET AROUND TO IT
THEY'LL BE READY FOR THEIR CLOSE UP IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES
ON THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT THE SUSPENSION WAS LIFTED
OPC SENT ALL THE NUMBERS IT HAD COLLECTED TO THE DVLA
IN RETURN FOR TWO THOUSAND
HANDED OVER THE CAR OWNERS' DETAILS
FOUR MILLION DRIVERS' DETAILS WERE ACCESSED FROM THEIR DATABASE
WE'VE SEEN HOW THE DVLA HAS AGREED TO REQUESTS BY COMPANIES WHICH HAVE BREACHED THE INDUSTRY
THE BPA THANKED US FOR BRINGING IT TO THEIR ATTENTION BUT SAID AS IT WAS ONLY A MINOR ONE
THE DVLA SAID THEY ONLY RESUMED THE COMPANY'S DATABASE ACCESS ONCE THEY WERE SATISFIED ALL LEGAL
WHEN WE TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS LATEST BREACH
AND ALTHOUGH THEY TAKE IN NEARLY THREE MILLION POUNDS FOR THE RELEASE OF DATA FROM PRIVATE PARKING COMPANIES
THIS ONCE AGAIN
PRIVATE PARKING COMPANIES HAVE NO RIGHT TO RECOVER A CHARGE FROM YOU WITHOUT FIRST TAKING YOU TO
THEN TAKE AWAY LOTS OF PEST CONTROLLERS AS PART OF SPENDING CUTS
ALONG WITH OTHER VERMIN AND INSECTS
BUT THAT'S ENOUGH ABOUT US
THE OPC HAVE BLAMED THE SIGNAGE COMPANY FOR THE MISLEADING WORDING AND SAID THEY'D REMOVE THEM
THE NEST IS INACTIVE AND POSES NO THREAT AT ALL
POUNDS THAT'S NOT TOO BAD
I CAN DEAL WITH THAT
THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR
SUPPOSE ANY BUSINESS
AND THESE CUSTOMERS SEEM TO HAVE EXPERIENCED ANYTHING BUT
BUT DON'T WORRY
WE DID MANAGE TO GET ONE OF THE CAMERAS SET UP AND ROLLING BEFORE HE GOT TO WORK
SEE WHAT WE SAW A BIT LATER
MILLIONS HAVE GOT ONE
NUMBER AND EXPIRY DATE AND THEN BEGIN USING YOUR CARD
THE BANK INTRODUCED ITS CONTACTLESS DEBIT AND CREDIT CARDS THREE YEARS AGO NOW AND OTHERS FOLLOWED
ALL IT TAKES FOR ME TO DO IS TO STAND NEXT TO SOMEBODY
IN JUST A FEW SECONDS
I CAN WAVE MY PHONE OVER THEIR BAG AND TAKE OUT THEIR DETAILS
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY
ACCORDING TO THE BANKS
THE FINANCIAL DAMAGE SHOULD BE LIMITED BECAUSE THE PHONE DOESN'T PICK UP THE THREE DIGIT SECURITY
ARE JUST AS VULNERABLE
THEY JUST HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO TEST THEM ALL YET
BARCLAYS SAY THAT
TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE
NO CUSTOMERS HAVE FALLEN VICTIM TO THIS TYPE OF FRAUD BUT THEIR SECURITY IS A TOP PRIORITY AND THE
ALONG WITH VISA
SAY THAT NO ONE IS ABLE TO LIFT OTHER VITAL INFORMATION FROM THE CARD
SUCH AS A SIGNATURE OR SECURITY CODE
THEY SETS UP TO RETAILERS TO ENSURE THEY HAVE THE REQUIRED SECURITY PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO
LESS THAN THIRTY SECONDS
THEY PROMISE A LUMP SUM ON YOUR DEATH
USUALLY TO COVER FUNERAL COSTS
MORE THAN TWO MILLION PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THEM OUT
THERE ARE NO RETAKES OR REHEARSALS
IT'LL PAY OUT A CASH LUMP SUM WHEN YOU'RE NO LONGER AROUND
TO THINK MY PARENTS ARE DOING THAT
THEY REALLY HAVE
BUT IT IS ALL ABOUT DOING THE NUMBERS BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IN MORE
SOME PLANS CHANGE
IF YOU'RE OBESE OR A HEAVY SMOKER OR GOT A MEDICAL CONDITION
IF YOU KNOW YOU'VE PROBABLY ONLY GOT A FEW YEARS LEFT
THEY CAN BE VERY
YOU'RE LOCKED INTO THESE
YOU WOULD LOSE EVERYTHING YOU'VE PUT IN
YOU MISS ONE PAYMENT AND IT'S GONE SO YOU HAVE TO THINK VERY
VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT CANCELLING
THIS IS MORE ABOUT
PUTTING MONEY IN A GOOD
BUT HIGH INTEREST SAVINGS ACCOUNT
AND THEN BUT IF YOU DIED EARLY
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE AS MUCH CASH
WHAT ALL THE COMPANIES MENTIONED SAY THESE ARE AFFORDABLE PLANS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH
THEY STRESS THAT THEIR INSURANCE PLANS
IT TOLD US IT WOULD INVESTIGATE THE ISSUES RAISED BUT
BUT COULDN'T COMMENT ON SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS
HE SENT OUR PRODUCTION TEAM INTO A PANIC
THANKS TO EXPERIENCE
THAT'S BECAUSE WITH OVER FIFTY S PLANS
WE HAVE GOT ONE OF THE CAMERAS WORKING IN TIME
THESE PRODUCTS ARE REALLY BAD VALUE
THE AMOUNT IT PAYS OUT IS FIXED SO IF YOU LIVE LONGER
THEY'RE GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE INCREDIBLY BAD VALUE
NEITHER WOULD HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE AGAINST HIBERNATING WASPS
THEY WOULD HAVE ALREADY LEFT THE NEST
IF THEY WERE WASPS
IN THE MEANTIME
IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHO THAT IS
YOU HAVE TO INCREASE SOMETHING ELSE
WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS PAINT
IT'S A PROBLEM THAT WE KNOW ABOUT
ENSUING REFORMULATIONS HAVE MEANT THAT THE YELLOWING PROCESS HAS
FOR SOME CUSTOMERS
BEEN MUCH SWIFTER THAN THEY EXPERIENCED PRIOR TO TWENTY TEN
SO THEREFORE IT PULLS INTO QUESTION
TO GET RID OF THE VOCS OR LOWER THE VOCS
YOU HAD TO REDUCE THE SOLVENT
IF YOU REDUCE THE SOLVENT
I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY SORRY TO THE THREE INDIVIDUALS IN THE FILM AND TO ANY OTHERS WHO'VE BEEN
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE DID SOLVE THE PROBLEM
AND WE REFORMULATED OUR PRODUCTS
AS DID EVERYONE ELSE
WE STARTED TO SEE A PROBLEM IN THE MARKET IN TWENTY TEN FOR A SMALL MINORITY OF CUSTOMERS UNDER CERTAIN
AND FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HAD A PROBLEM AND WEVE ACTUALLY HAVE COMPLAINED TO US OR CONTACTED OUR
THERE MAY BE A ROGUE CAN OUT IN THE STORES OF OLD FORMULATION
BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THE PRODUCTS WE'VE BEEN PRODUCING SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN ARE ON THE SHELVES TODAY ARE AS GOOD
AND IF CUSTOMERS HAVE ANY QUERIES ABOUT THESE PAINTS
THEY SHOULD CONTACT THE DULUX TECHNICAL ADVICE CENTRE BY EMAIL OR PHONE
THE NUMBER IS FREE
I'M NOT MAKING A MOUNTAIN OUT OF A MOLEHILL
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH COMPANIES OF SIMILAR NAMES
HE'S ALREADY SEEN HOW ONE EMPLOYEE PERSUADED A COUPLE TO PART WITH HUNDREDS OF POUNDS BY
RATS CAN LIVE IN ANY NUMBER
IF THERE WERE THAT MANY RATS
WHICH I VERY MUCH DOUBT THERE ARE
THE ONE WITH THE LEAST PACKAGING
THEY'VE DISMISSED GRAHAM AND SAY THEY'VE TAKEN APPROPRIATE STEPS WITH OTHER STAFF MEMBERS
JUST TIME FOR A COUPLE OF EMAILS
THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE WITH YELLOW DOORS AND WALLS
THEY'RE DULUX CUSTOMERS AND THEY ARE NOT HAPPY
WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING MAD
THANKS FOR CONFIRMING IT'S NOT US
SHE'S PAINTED IT THREE TIMES WITHIN SIX MONTHS AND IT'S STILL YELLOW
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE
YEAH AND SHE'S GOING TO LOVE THAT
ACROSS THE NATION
THE MAGIC OF TEA IN A IN SOME CASES
FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY SPAGHETTI BOLOGNEISE
ESPECIALLY WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CHEESE
PRETTY BUDGET FRIENDLY
BUT THAT IT'S ALSO PACKED FULL OF PROTEIN
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS
THE REPAIR AND REBUILDING OF MUSCLE TISSUE CAN'T TAKE PLACE
I'M TALKING ABOUT
AND THEN LEMONY
SO WE'VE GOT SMALLER TREES
THAT WE DON'T NEED LADDERS
IT'S IN THE PAST
AND WHAT ARE THESE
THESE DITCHES WOULD HAVE HELD STAGNANT WATER
THEY COULD LAMB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
AND QUITE MODERN
I GREW UP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD
PEOPLE HAVE PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT LAVENDER
EVERYTHING FROM BEING ANTIBACTERIAL TO ANTIFUNGAL TO EVEN ANTIINFLAMMATORY
AND THUS I WAS NEVER CERTAIN WHEN THEY'RE IN SEASON AND I NEVER KNEW QUITE WHERE TO GET THEM
MY GRANDFATHER GAVE IT TO ME
HE KNEW I WAS A BIG JAMES BOND FAN
CAME TO THE RESCUE AND
TRIED VARIOUS KEYS
SO IF YOUR FATHER HADN'T RESCUED THESE PANELS
WE WOULD NEVER KNOW
AS LONG AS HE COULD REMEMBER
ARE DO DIFFERENT ACTS
SINGING AND DANCING
THREE VASES THAT DON'T LOOK THAT DIFFERENT
AND WHERE IT COMES FROM
WHICH IS WHAT THIS IS
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT PEOPLE PAID OVER THOUSAND
I INHERITED IT FROM MY GRANDMOTHER
I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE GOT IT FROM
IN PROBABLY THE NINETEEN SEVENTY S ALMOST EVERY PROVINCIAL ANTIQUE SHOP IN THE UK HAD ONE
QUITE A CHALLENGE THIS WEEK
YOU CAN CHECK OUT OUR LOCATIONS ON OUR WEBSITE BBC
OUR CERAMICS SPECIALIST
SHARP POINTY THING
HE UNDERSTANDS THE RISKS OF NOT BEING STRAIGHT WITH ME
IT WOULDN'T WORK
I DIVIDE MY TIME BETWEEN HERE AND MONTEVIDEO
YOU COULD HAVE A TRANSPLANT WITHIN HOURS
WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO SOME OF OUR PATIENTS
THE PRESSURE IN THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE HEART HAS INCREASED
WHICH MAKES HIM AT HIGH RISK FOR TRANSPLANTATION
THEY STILL THINK THAT SOUL HAS A FUTURE
OR HOW STORMY THE ANAESTHETIC HAD BEEN LAST TIME AND THAT THIS TIME IT WILL BE EQUALLY HIGH RISK
AND SO THEREFORE
WE'VE GOT SO MUCH TRUST IN THE DOCTORS HERE
WE WILL BE GOING HOME
IF THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS TO ASSIST
THAT WOULD BE THE SAFEST THING FOR
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE HERE SO
VERY OFTEN YOU HAVE TO REPEAT THINGS QUITE A FEW TIMES JUST JUST SO YOU'RE SURE THAT THAT THEY KNOW EXACTLY
SO IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT LISTENING
THAT THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY
THIS HEART IS SUPPOSED TO BE HEALTHY
AND THAT'S BAD
THE BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR
AND IF WE LOOK DOWN TOWARDS THE BASE
THAT MUST BE RIGHT
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THEM
A MAN CALLED WANSLAW
WAS WALKING NEAR SOUTHAMPTON ONE DAY NEAR A FARM AND SAW A BOX
MAY I HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR BOX
THAT IT WOULD BE A VERY NARROW MARKET
JUST BECAUSE I WAS ON A WALKING TOUR AT THE TIME
AND SHE TAUGHT ME THE NAME OF THIS TOWN WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG
WITH APOLOGIES TO OUR WELSH VIEWERS FOR MY ACCENT
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER THE PRICE
CAN YOU HELP ME
BUT IT'S A SORT OF WARREN
I THINK IT'S CHINESE PROVINCIAL
WHERE IN THAT VAST COUNTRY IT WAS ACTUALLY MADE I DON'T KNOW
TURN OF THE CENTURY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHAT WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO SEE BROUGHT IN AT WIMBLEDON
APART FROM THE SETTING
AT THE END OF THE BUDGET SPEECH
GETTING OUR FINANCES BACK IN ORDER
IS ABSOLUTELY ON COURSE
AND THEY'RE SITTING ON IT AS RAINY DAY MONEY
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO CONFIDENCE AT ALL IN OUR ECONOMY AND WHERE IT IS GOING
EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BUDGET LEAK WAS A MAJOR RESIGNATION ISSUE FOR A CHANCELLOR
WE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE JOY OF SEEING THE LABOUR HIGH COMMAND IN A GREGGS TRYING TO PRETEND
EMBARRASSING PICTURES OF THEM FLOATING AROUND IN SORT OF WHITE TIE
CARAVAN AND CHARITY TAX U TURNS
BECAUSE AS FAR AS IT SEEMS
ANYBODY PUSHES THEM
THAT IS WHAT I'LL JUDGE GEORGE OSBORNE ON
NOT THE PASTIES
NOT THE CARAVAN BUT
SO WHENEVER A POLITICIAN CHANGES HIS MIND
GOOD HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND BECAUSE HE'S THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND LISTENED TO WHAT HE'S SAID
GOVERNMENT IN CHAOS
WE'VE ALL DONE IT
BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED ABOUT THE BIG FU IT'LL BE OVER A UTURN
THAT'S ONE OF THE DAMAGING THINGS
RATHER THAN PEOPLE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW GOING FUNDAMENTALLY WITH WHAT THEY BELIEVE AND AND SEEKING TO LEAD
WHEN WHEN THERE IS A KICKBACK
IF YOU IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT
LET'S STICK WITH IT AND GO WITH IT
WE DO GO THROUGH THIS CYCLE
IS WE WANT TO NEGOTIATE AND WE CAN'T EVEN GET THE SECRETARY OF STATE ROUND THE TABLE
SO HELP AVOID THESE SITUATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE
AND WE GOT THERE AND WE MADE SOME VERY DIFFICULT CHANGES
THIS GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO BE GOING FOR CONFRONTATION FIRST
AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE AS STUPID AS WE'RE BEING LED TO THINK
THEY'VE ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO GO ON STRIKE TO GET HEARD BY THE GOVERNMENT
IS TO INCREASE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS
SO WE ARE ASKING THE DOCTORS
SITS DOWN REGULARLY WITH THEM
I THINK THEY ARE WRONG TO GO ON STRIKE
I THINK THAT THEY'VE BEEN WHIPPED UP A BIT BY SOME PEOPLE IN THE PROFESSION
AND IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE TO ANY OF US WHO ARE DESPERATELY WORRIED ABOUT PATIENT CARE
THE SECOND OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE MONEY
AND IN THE END SOMEONE HAS TO SAY
HARDLY ANYBODY AT WORK CAN LOOK FORWARD TO THE KIND OF PENSION THEY WOULD'VE GOT TWENTY YEARS AGO
THERE'S A LOT OF PAIN BEING SUFFERED
THEY'RE NOT GOING ON STRIKE
AND IT SEEMS ODD THAT THE DOCTORS WHO ARE GETTING SIX FIGURE SALARIES
THAT THESE DOCTORS
AND THEY HAVEN'T DONE THIS FOR FORTY YEARS
IF I WERE TO PAY IN FOR FORTY YEARS AN EIGHT PERCENT CONTRIBUTION I WOULD HAVE FUNDED ABOUT THREE YEARS OF MY
MY ANSWER IS NO
I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD STRIKE
THE BIG ISSUE HERE IS THAT THERE IS A PENSION TIME BOMB TAKING PLACE
THREATS TO STRIKE
GIVEN WHAT'S TAKING PLACE AND
AND IF THAT'S OUR ONLY REAL RESPONSE THAT WE CAN HAVE TO THE AWFUL THINGS TAKING PLACE IN SYRIA
KOFI ANNAN IS TRYING TO GET THIS MEASURE IN PLACE
BUT THE SECOND ISSUE IS JUST HOW INFLUENTIAL THE RUSSIANS ARE IN THIS AND ACTUALLY THE DESTINY OF SYRIA
WOULD THE UK BE JUSTIFIED IN BANNING SYRIAN DELEGATION MEMBERS WITH CONNECTIONS TO THE ASSAD REGIME
THERE IS THE THE STOMACH FOR MILITARY INTERVENTION I THINK IS VERY QUESTIONABLE
YOU CAN'T JUST BAN OFFICIALS AND
BUT THAT'S FACE IT
LOOK AT SAUDI ARABIA
AND IN DUE COURSE
COME JULY IN THE NEGOTIATIONS
WE HOPE THERE WILL BE AN INTERNATIONAL ARMS TRADE TREATY
BUT AT THE MOMENT
THE SORT OF SANCTIONS YOU COULD LOOK AT ARE FINANCIAL SANCTIONS
AND THE IDEA THAT ANYBODY WHO WAS INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING WHAT WE SAW AT THE WEEKEND IN HOLA
AND LET'S LET'S CALL IT A GENOCIDE
MAKE THINGS BETTER
I ALSO AGREE THAT MILITARY INTERVENTION AT THIS POINT IN TIME FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS PROBABLY
HOW MUCH STRONGER WOULD THAT EMBARGO BE IF IT COVERED SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE
BUT THE GENERALS ON THE GROUND
BUT WE CAN BE PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS
FRASER IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
WE CANNOT SOLVE ANY OF THESE ISSUES ON OUR OWN
BUT WE CAN BE PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES
IT IS COMPLICATED
THE QUESTION YOU ASKED ABOUT THE OLYMPICS IS NOT COMPLICATED
SHOULD THEY COME HERE
IT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO
THE KEY POINT HERE IS THE SYRIA POINT
AND I WHOLLY AGREE WITH MARK AND FRASER AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THE MOST
WE CAN ONLY DO WHAT IS LEGAL
YOU ARE LOOKING AT DELIBERATE MASSACRES AND THE MOST COMPLICATED
ARMING THE REBELS OR PROVIDING SAFE AREAS
IT DOES SEEM INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING BUT I ACTUALLY CAN'T SEE WHAT MORE WE CAN DO
EVERYBODY IGNORES WHAT THEY SAY
THEY HAVE MEETINGS
I MISSED TWO EPISODES
I UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT CAME OUT TODAY IS THAT JEREMY HUNT
SHOULD HE BE FIRED
OF COURSE HE SHOULD
OF COURSE HE SHOULD BE FIRED
EACH NEEDS TO KEEP A COLD
AND ALL POLITICIANS COME WITH BAGGAGE
THERE WAS CLEARLY A VERY COSY RELATIONSHIP THERE
AND WHEN THEY'RE SITTING IN COURT
THEY WILL PROBABLY KNOW THE BARRISTERS IN FRONT OF THEM
AND AS SOON AS HE WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF THE BID
OFTEN DOING THINGS
THEY ALL HAPPENED BEFORE
DAVID CAMERON SAID TO US WELL
THAT EVIDENCE CAME OUT TODAY
ISN'T THAT A TRANSGRESSION OF THE MINISTERIAL CODE
OF COURSE IT HAPPENS
BUT BUT TO CONSTRUE THAT AS THEM SAYING THEY THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS
THE FRENCH DID IT
WE CAN'T STOP ANYBODY FROM GREECE
WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM
IT DEPENDS IF YOU'RE IN THE MARKET TO BUY A PROPERTY IN THE SOUTH EAST RIGHT NOW
THE ODDS ARE THEY PROBABLY SET ABOUT BUSINESS AND DO QUITE WELL
I LOVE THAT WE HAVE A FREE PRESS IN THIS COUNTRY
PARTLY I THINK IT'S DOWN TO OUR BENEFITS SYSTEM BEING VERY OPEN
MEANT THAT WE THEN STARTED TO GET A LITTLE BIT SORT OF JINGOISTIC AND WE STARTED TO TRY AND PUT THE BARRIERS UP AND
FIRST IT'S THE GREEKS WE DON'T WANT
WE WOULD WELCOME AND WE'D WANT TO HAVE THAT
NOT PICKING ON THE GREEKS
WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THESE MEASURES THAT THE HOME SECRETARY IS PUTTING IN PLACE
OUR HISTORICAL EUROSCEPTICISM HAS MEANT THAT WHEN THE EURO FOR EXAMPLE
AND THE ARCHITECTURE AROUND IT WERE BEING DESIGNED
WE ONCE AGAIN WERE NOT IN THE DESIGN OFFICE
WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE DIVERGENCE CRITERIA
WHEN THEY ALL START TUGGING AGAINST EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ALL BEHAVING IN THE SAME WAY
WE WERE IN THAT ARGUMENT
JOURNALISTS AND POLITICIANS
ONE VICTORIAN FREAK SHOW
THEY SHOULD BE INDIVISIBLE
IT'S WHETHER THE ECONOMY RECOVERS OR NOT
THERE ARE CLEAR RULES AND GUIDELINES ABOUT HOW YOU BEHAVE
YOU HOPE IT WILL MEAN YOU GET BETTER COVERAGE
HUNGRY GREEKS AND IF WE ARE
HUNGRY GREEKS AND WHERE WOULD WE PUT THEM AND WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD WE DO WITH THEM
OBVIOUSLY SOME SORT OF TERRIBLE NUT
I'M NOT GOING TO GET ANGRY
I'M GOING TO SPEND THE TIME SITTING DOWN AND WRITING A LONG
NEVER TOOK ANY BENEFIT
I WROTE VERY RESPECTFULLY AND CAREFULLY
THATLL CHANGE I PUT IT IN THE PILLAR BOX
THE GROWTH THAT WE NEED TO GET THE JOBS BACK TO GET OUR OWN ECONOMY BACK ON ITS FEET
THE PEOPLE COMING HERE WILL BE THE LEAST OF THE ISSUES WE WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH
IF THIS COLLAPSE HAPPENS
AND PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY WHO ARE DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR A JOB
WE NEED TO BE PARTNERS WITH EUROPE
GET THE CREDIT BACK INTO OUR ECONOMY TO GET THINGS MOVING AGAIN
NOT TO BE ON THE EDGES
CHARLES KENNEDY AND THE ACTOR ALAN CUMMING AND OTHERS
AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK WE'RE GOING TO BE IN STOCKTON ON TEA
I AM AN OPTIMIST ABOUT PEOPLE THAT COME
TALK TO OUR PANEL ARGUE WITH THEM
VISIT OUR WEBSITE
I THINK WE'LL MAKE ROOM
JUST STICK MORE SAUSAGES ON THE BARBECUE
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH
UNTIL NEXT THURSDAY
I THINK I RECOGNISE ALL THIS
IT'S BEEN USED AS A BACKDROP FOR MORE THAN THIRTY HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTERS
INCLUDING PARTS OF THE CARIBBEAN
THE KING'S SPEECH AND APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH
BY ONE OF WREN'S TWIN DOMES
OUR FIRST WAS CHOSEN FOR HER MAJESTY'S WEDDING TO PRINCE PHILIP BACK IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN
A ROYAL PALACE STOOD ON THIS SITE
AS WERE HIS DAUGHTERS
THE WORLD WIDE WEB WAS RELEASED
FOURTH AND FIFTH
I'LL HAVE DETAILS OF AN EVENT THAT'S ALWAYS A HIGHLIGHT
I'LL GET THINKING ABOUT THAT
ANYWAY THIS YEAR'S BIG SING AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL
SO BE SURE TO HAVE A PEN AND PAPER HANDY
THIS YEAR PROMISES TO BE BETTER THAN EVER WITH GREAT GUESTS AND
I JUST FELT A REAL SENSE OF CALM WHEN I STOOD UP TO ACTUALLY PERFORM
SO OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A PLEASURE TO SING IT FOR THE QUEEN
AFTER SIXTY YEARS OF FAITHFUL SERVICE AND EXAMPLE
WHOSE SON REIGNS AS SERVANT
IT'S THAT SPECIAL TIME OF YEAR WHEN I CAN ANNOUNCE HOW TO APPLY FOR TICKETS FOR THIS YEAR'S BIG
WE'LL BE SINGING SOME GREAT HYMNS IN THE COMPANY OF THE FIRST FIVE
I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT THIS FOR OVER A YEAR
LET'S PLAY A GAME
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN A COWARD
WITH THE OLYMPICS STARTING THIS WEEK
THEY'VE GOT THE T SHIRT AND OF COURSE
THESE TWO WILL BE GOING FOR GOLD
WHEN IT COMES TO THE OLYMPICS
IT'S THE TURN OF THE CAPTAINS NOW AND THIS WEEK
WE'VE GOT NOTHING ELSE
THE CAPTAINS WILL HAVE SIXTY SECONDS TO DESCRIBE A NUMBER OF OLYMPIC TERMS
THE THREE OF US
WHERE THE INJURIES EXCEED THOSE THAT CAN BE SUITABLY REFLECTED BY COMMON ASSAULT
HE WAS TRYING TO PULL IT AWAY
IT'S A REFERENCE BOOK
ALL WITH A CHANCE TO WIN THOUSANDS OF POUNDS
YOU CAN WIN UP TO TWELVE
UM AND I SET A COMPANY UP ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME TIME
WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING
STRATEGY CONSULTANT FROM KINGSTON
MARKETING CONSULTANT FROM GLASGOW
I'LL JUST REPLACE IT WITH AN EASIER ONE
BECAUSE THE MONEY HALVES EVERY TIME
ONE OF THE PACK WILL THEN TAKE HER PLACE
LET'S PLAY BEAT THE PACK
ALL ANNE HAS TO DO IS ANSWER ONE QUESTION CORRECTLY FROM EACH CATEGORY FOR THE CHANCE TO WIN UP TO TWELVE
THERE ARE NO SECOND CHANCES
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT
I MUST ASK YOU TO LEAVE THE PACK
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY B
I WOULDN'T HAVE GOT IT RIGHT
HIS GAME IS OVER
SOMETHING WITH A PRINCE IN IT GIVES ME HOPE THERE MIGHT BE A PRINCESS
HE'S GOING TO PLAY ON THE ONE
THEY CAN BEAT THE PACK
TODAY WE'RE IN SOMERSET
WHICH IS LITERALLY JUST UP THE ROAD
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS IN
BECAUSE THIS HAS REALLY COME HOME
AND THEN THE OTHER ONE
THAT GOES AGAINST IT
I'VE GOT MY FAVOURITES
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE BIDDERS THINK
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE FORTY S
HAVING BEEN SHUT FOR THE LAST FOUR MONTHS
AND THAT'S QUITE GOOD
WE GET THE ODD BIT OF DEATH WATCH BUT
THROUGH THESE CLASSICAL COLUMNS
BUT THEY ALSO MADE
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS
CHECK THE DETAILS IN YOUR LOCAL PRESS
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE PART IN FLOG IT
VERY MUCH LIKE THIS ONE
FOLLOW THE LINKS
LET'S SEE IF IT WORKS WITH THIS ONE
YEAH JUST EMAIL THAT TO ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CALLING AND TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO WAIT FOR ME WHILE I'VE TAKEN THE TIME
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SCORING
THE WHOLE OF WIMBLEDON ANNOYS ME FOR THE WHOLE TIME
OR THE GEEKSQUEUING FOR THE LATEST IPHONE
LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING TEA
WHICH IS ALL ABOUTQUEUING
BEING A NATIONAL TREASURE
I HAVE A MAN WHO DOES MYQUEUING FOR ME
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH SECURITY
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT HAS WON THE LUCAS FOR MOST ANNOYINGQUEUE
AH WHERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TOQUEUE TO GET INTO THE AIRPORT
I SPENT MUCH OF MY CHILDHOOD PARKED IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION SET
WATCHING CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS
WHETHER IT WAS MULTICOED SWAP SHOP WITH JOHN CRAVEN
SATURDAY SUPERSTORE WITH JOHN CRAVEN
AND THEN AS HE DOES IT
WHAT IS YOUR VERDICT AND WHY
EVERY WEEK WE FIND OUT WHICH SPECIAL SKILLS OUR GUESTS NORMALLY KEEP UNDER WRAPS
YOUR NOMINATIONS PLEASE

THE TWITTER GENERATION
COURAGE AND CONVICTION
IT'S TIME TO PUT EMEN'S TALENT TO THE TEST
PLEASE JOIN ME AS WE GO OVER THERE TO THE SALOON OVER THERE

JUST TOP OF THE TREE WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY
IT'S TOO LATE NOW
HE HAS A WIFE WHO CANNOT HOLD HER TONGUE
CAN THEY STAY AHEAD AND BEAT THE PACK
YOU CAN WIN UP TO TWELVE
I LIKE GARDENING
IT'S GOOD TO GET TO KNOW YOU
BUT I THINK IT'S TIME TO FOCUS ON THE GAME
A LEVEL STUDENT
THE MONEY HALVES EVERY TIME SHE PASSES
SHE'S OUT OF THE GAME
NO SECOND CHANCES
BUT IF SHE DOESN'T LIKE A QUESTION
BOTH OF YOU ARE THROUGH TO THE NEXT CATEGORY AND THROUGH TO THE SAFE ZONE
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
SO WE HALVE YOUR MONEY TO ONE THOUSAND
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER
I THINK ALL THE CATEGORIES HAVE JUST BEEN POSSIBLY THE WORST
MAKE THE WRONG DECISION AT THE WRONG TIME AND IT'S ALL OVER
IT'S GREAT NEWS FOR YOU
INSTEAD OF PLAYING FOR MONEY
WHEN LORNA WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO WIN UP TO TWELVE
BUT ONLY IF SHE CAN BEAT THE PACK
FROM DAIMLER'S FIRST HORSELESS CARRIAGE
RIGHT THROUGH TO THE SUPERSONIC THRUST SSC
AND MUCH MORE AND BEYOND
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YOUS ONE OF THE SEVERAL MEDIA STUDENTS THAT'S HERE WORKING AS A STEWARD FOR US AND
THERE'S ONE SPECIAL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO'VE CAPTURED THE THOUGHTS OF A GENERATION LIKE
IT WAS A MIX OF BLACK AND WHITE
CAPTURING THE SENTIMENT OF A TIME AND A PLACE
WHICH REFLECTED THE GROWING RACIAL INTEGRATION
TO MAYBE JUST ONE SONG LIKE THE BEATLES
ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE
KNOWN AS THE SUMMER OF LOVE
I THINK THAT EVERYONE WHO WAS ASSOCIATED WITH TWO TONE WERE ALWAYS DEALING WITH THE SOCIAL
BLACK AND WHITE
A DECADE IN HISTORY
SO DOES THE MUSIC
WITH HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT
IT SEEMS THE MESSAGE OF TWO TONE IS STILL VERY
I DON'T BELIEVE IT
IT'S RATHER SORT OF A WACKY
FANCY DRESS COSTUME
IT'S A MATTER OF OPINION
THE MAN ON THE ROSTRUM
THIS IS WAY ABOVE ME
WE'VE TALKED TO THE BRITISH MUSEUM
UM SEE HOW HE'S BEARING UP
SO I THINK I MOVED HIM
WHAT TIME DID I FIND HIM
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT
ALL WITH A CHANCE TO WIN THOUSANDS OF POUNDS
YOU CAN WIN UP TO TWELVE
I TRIED TO BE NICE SO THAT I DIDN'T GET ELIMINATED
I WANT TO FIND MY OWN BILL MURRAY
BEAT THE PACK AND EARNED THE RIGHT TO RETURN AS OUR CONTROL PLAYER ON TODAY'S SHOW
IF SHE DOESN'T LIKE A QUESTION
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT
I'LL JUST REPLACE IT WITH AN EASIER ONE BUT IT WILL COST LORNA SOME MONEY
THE MONEY HALVES EVERY TIME SHE PASSES
SHE'S OUT OF THE GAME
AND THEN BON VOYAGE WAS LIKE THAT
I GOT THERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT'S JUST RUBBISH
TO PLAY CHESS YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL AROUND A LOT
IT'S TOO DIFFICULT
BECAUSE YESTERDAY I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT THE SHOW AND I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING THAT THIS
SHE MIGHT BE A CHEMICAL EXPERT
BUT SCIENCE I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT
HE LEAVES JUST BEFORE THE FINAL
AND WITH THE CHANCE TO WIN UP TO TWELVE
OUR DAY CENTRE MANAGER
BEAT THE PACK AND EARNED THE RIGHT TO RETURN AS OUR CONTROL PLAYER ON TODAY'S SHOW
PLEASE COME AND JOIN ME
YOU CAN WIN UP TO TWELVE
THERE IS SEVEN OF THEM
NO SECOND CHANCES

I'LL JUST REPLACE IT WITH AN EASIER ONE
THE MONEY HALVES EVERY TIME SHE PASSES
A DOUBLE ANSWER
I ACTUALLY REMEMBER WATCHING THAT BECAUSE I'D JUST FLOWN BACK FROM SAN FRANCISCO
I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT I WILL PICK THE RIGHT ONE
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE FILM
ESPECIALLY DAVID TEN
THE FIFTH OF SIX
I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY
WITH ONLY TWO PACK MEMBERS
YOU WANT TO PLAY AND THE ANSWER YOU'RE GIVING IS WHISKERS
VERY TENSE FINAL
COMES FROM THAT STUNNING CUMBRIAN TOWN
STANDING HERE ON BARROW'S DOORSTEP
BECAUSE I AM DESPERATE TO GO TO NEW ZEALAND IN JULY THIS YEAR
ALTHOUGH I LOVE IT
HERE'S A QUICK REMINDER OF ALL THE ITEMS THAT ARE GOING TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER AND HOPEFULLY EARN OUR OWNERS
AND THE STORY OF HOW HE WROTE THAT FIRST BOOK IS AS COMPELLING AS ANY OF THE WALKER CHILDREN'S
BECAUSE THAT IS HARD WORK
YOU KNOW HE WAS A KEEN FISHERMAN
AND IT'S QUITE HIGH AT THE MOMENT
AND IT HAS WONDERFUL STYLE
THERE'S PLENTY MORE SURPRISES TO COME
AND SHE LIKES YOU
IT'S HORRIBLE TO SAY IT
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
YEAH RATHER THAN JUST SITTING ON THEIR BOTTOMS
I WANT TO MARRY YOU SO
I CAN RUIN THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
DIVORCE IS ON THE RISE
STAR RAVING INSANE AS IT MAY SEEM
TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF TRULY INCREDIBLE FUND RAISING
ITS ABOUT THE MONEY IN YOUR POCKET
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY ON ME
PEOPLE NO LONGER TRUST SUPERMARKET READY MEALS
AND RADIO TWO LISTENERS
OF WHICH NAME OR ORIGIN I HAVE NO IDEA
SO IM HERE TO SUPPORT IT
YOUR LOVED ONES
A JACKET WITHOUT POCKETS
WHY WOULD YOU PAY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
THAT'S ANOTHER THING
ALL THEIR WONDERFUL FILMS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE EVENING
WE ARE TENTATIVELY ON THE PRECIPICE OF MAKING HISTORY
COMIC RELIEF GONNA GET IT
JUST PRESS RED ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
EARLY SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
THIS WAS MADE IN
IT'S THE EASY THING TO PRETEND
SO THAT'S THAT MUCH OLDER
LIKE THE GRAPHIC
ONE IS WORTH FIFTY
BEST CHALLENGE SET BY HENRY SANDON THIS WEEK
AND WHEN MY SISTER HAD HER
SHE HAD HER IN A BAG AND
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY OBJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT TIME THROUGH YOUR FAMILY
LOTS AND LOTS OF THEM
I'M JUST THINKING AT MY LEVEL
I'VE BEEN VERY LUCKY
BUT WE NEVER DID
SHE WAS FINE WHEN I LEFT HER
MADE SURE I WAS SAFE AT NIGHT
WE WILL BAG UP BEFORE WE GO NOW
I'VE GOT A PATIENT WITH SOME BURNS TO
TO THE BUTTOCKS HAVING SAT ON A HOT WOOD BURNING STOVE LAST NIGHT
BEING IN THE WATER
THEN THEY'RE GOING THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE COLD WITHIN THE LIFE RAFT ITSELF
I MEAN BEING IN NOVEMBER
WE OFTEN VALUE THINGS THAT ARE EXOTIC AND RARE AND SOMETIMES REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT OF CONSERVATION
SO TODAY'S LOCATION IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT
EIGHT IT'S ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST HISTORIC ATTRACTIONS AND
THEY WILL BE FINDING OUT
I SET EVERYBODY A TASK
SOMETHING CONNECTED WITH THE PROGRAMME OR WITH THE ZOO
RIGHT BUT THERE'S A FEW I'VE PICKED UP SO FAR
SOMEONE WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL THERE
I' GOING TO CATCH UP WITH THAT LATER
I WAS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY ABOUT PAUL MCCARTNEY
PAY FOR EVERY SHOW
I CAN'T REMEMBER
IT'S A BUSY OLD PLACE
YOU LISTEN TO THE MUSIC STILL
HERE AT THE NEWLY OPENED ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS
THE ZOO EMPLOYED ARTISTS TO DOCUMENT THEIR GROWING COLLECTION OF EXOTIC WILDLIFE
OF WHICH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SURVIVE TODAY
MANY OF THEM WERE DRAWN FROM LIFE
MOST OF HIS DRAWINGS
LIKE ARTHUR CONAN JOY
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE
AND THEY DIDN'T COME BACK FOR IT
YOU'VE DONE JOLLY WELL
I DIDN'T REALISE THAT
SO I'M NOT BIASED
SO HE HE WAS A DOCTOR
AND YOU'RE HAPPY
LET'S PUT IT TO THE TEST
I DO THAT IN LONDON
AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD THING
BEING AWARE OF THE REALITY OF PEOPLE'S LIVES
FOR A TRULY UNIQUE AND HISTORIC OCCASION THE INAUGURATION OF THE FIRST EVER POPE FROM LATIN
THE FIRST NON-EUROPEAN POPE IN OVER A THOUSAND
THAT WAS HIS CHARACTER AND PERSONALITY
I HOPE HE CAN CARRY ON LIKE THIS
A LOT OF FIRSTS
IT'S NOT ABOUT LAING IT OVER PEOPLE
WHEN DID YOU FEED ME
WHEN I WAS HUNGRY
THE PROTECTOR OF THE HOLY FAMILY
THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT THE POOR
THERE WAS VERY STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGE
FIGHTING FOR COMPETENCE
AND BE ITS PROTECTORS
AUTHORITY IS ABOUT SERVICE
HE MIGHT CONSIDER THAT
EVERYBODY CONGRATULATING AND HUGGING EACH OTHER
WITH THE SUN SHINING
ALMOST A DEAFENING SOUND
AND I THINK THAT WAS THE DIFFICULTY
HOWEVER GOOD HE IS
COMING INTO OFFICE
FOR THE FIRST TIME
THE NEED FOR PROCLAIMING THE GOSPEL
THAT GIVES ME TREMENDOUS HOPE FOR RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BOTH THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION AND US AND THE OTHER
AND WE ONLY LIVE YOU KNOW A NORMAL LIFESPAN
UM SO WE DON'T SEE MUCH CHANGE
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD DISTINCTION THAT THE ARCHBISHOP MADE
IN A SHORT SPACE OF TIME
FUNNY AND AT EASE
I HAVE REASSIGNED ALL YOUR PATIENTS
HE WAS A VULNERABLE PATIENT
AND YOU TOLD HIM THAT
WHEN I FOUND OUT
ALL WITH A CHANCE TO WIN THOUSANDS OF POUNDS
YOU CAN WIN UP TO TWELVE
OUR INVOICE CLERK FROM LIVERPOOL
BEAT THE PACK AND EARNED THE RIGHT TO RETURN AS OUR CONTROL PLAYER ON TODAY'S SHOW
YOU'RE DEFINITELY IN THE FINAL
DATA ANALYST FROM CARDIFF
OPERATIONS MANAGER FROM ROCHDALE
SHE'S OUT OF THE GAME
NO SECOND CHANCES
HOWEVER IF SHE DOESN'T LIKE A QUESTION
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT
I'LL JUST REPLACE IT WITH AN EASIER ONE
SO QUITE GLAD I LEFT THAT
THOUSAND POUNDS THAT SHE BANKED
A REAL SHAME FOR HER
I LIVE IN SOMERSET
ORIGINALLY FROM BIRMINGHAM
VIRUSES CREEP THROUGH SYSTEMS
BUT IT MAKES YOU SAFE FOR NOW
PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE SAFE AREA
BUT IF I WAS BACK
I'M AFRAID THAT BECKY HAS SINGLED YOU OUT
I WAS ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED IT WAS JOHNNY WILKINSON BUT
THE BRAVERY COST HER
A COUPLE OF TIMES I HAD NO CLUE AND YOU COULD JUST TAKE A STAB AT IT
WE WENT TO GREAT YARMA FOR TWO DAYS
I THINK SHE'D QUITE LIKE TO GO TO DUBLIN
IF I HAD TO HAVE NATURAL HISTORY
MAKE SURE YOU JOIN US NEXT TIME WHEN SOMEONE ELSE WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO WIN UP TO TWELVE
ONLY IF THEY CAN BEAT THE PACK
I'M ADVISED AT THE TIME OF THE CRASH
I WAS EITHER AT THAT POINT OR AFTER THAT POINT
OR DURING THE TRAVEL TO THE HOSPITAL WAS WHEN I BECAME UNCONSCIOUS AND THEN I STOPPED BREATHING
AND AT SOME POINT THEN
I WAS RESUSCITATED
UM SO I'M NOT SURE
AND THE FURTHEST
HE'S GOING TO BE FINE
NINETEEN TWENTIETH SET WAY
THEN IT WON'T HAPPEN TO YOU AGAIN
I WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS EXPRESSION BY MY AUNTIE MA
I SHOULD EXPLAIN AUNTIE MORAG WAS NOT ACTUALLY A BLOOD RELATION
LOOK AFTER THE PENNIES
BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER
WE THINK WE HAVE IT BAD IN THIS COUNTRY BUT
BUT OVERSEAS THEY SEEM TO HAVE EVEN MORE BIZARRE PROVERBS
THE WINNERS OF EACH AWARD ARE DECIDED BY A PANEL OF JUDGES
TIME AND TIDE WAIT FOR NO MAN
BUT WHICH CLICHES DO OUR GUESTS THINK WE SHOULD AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE
FOR THE LUCAS FOR LEAST HELPFUL EXPRESSION
LIGHTNING NEVER STRIKES TWICE IN THE SAME PLACE
IF YOU'RE DEPRESSED
THE DARKEST HOUR IS
SO THE PHRASE SHOULD REALLY BE
IF YOU'RE DEPRESSED
IT WILL PROBABLY CARRY ON FOR SOME TIME
ANYTHING MUM SAYS
I'M IN FOR MUM'S CORRECTION
IF YOU'RE A PREGNANT WOMAN
SOMEONE PUSHED IN FRONT OF ME AT THE CHECKOUT
THEY ARE BROUGHT IN IN AMBULANCES
AND WHEN I SHOT HIM DEAD
A POLICEMAN GAVE ME A STERN TALKING TO
I HAVE HEARD THE LAW THAT IN SCOTLAND
APPARENTLY ANYONE CAN WE THE STREET
AS LONG AS YOU SHOUT
IF YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT A HELMET
AND YOU WERE IN PRIVATE
YOU OFTEN FIND DEAD BODIES
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
IT'S REGULATION SIX
IT DOESN'T MENTION FLYING
HOLLY'S GOT A POINT BUT
BUT OF COURSE IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU WERE FLYING AND IF IT WAS A STRANGE CONTRAPTION THAT HOLLY WAS
WE ARE JOINED TONIGHT BY A LAWYER
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING TO WIN THE LUCAS FOR MOST RIDICULOUS BRITISH LAW
IT'S TIME TO SAY
BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT ACTUALLY WAS A LAW
WHO'S PRESUMABLY OFF DOING SOMETHING ROYAL
IF YOU SAW THEM
IF THEY WERE VAGUELY ALIVE
TIME FOR OUR FINAL LUCAS OF THE NIGHT
IT'S OUR HIDDEN TALENT AWARD
IT'S NOT REALLY A TALENT
EACH WEEK WE FIND OUT WHICH SPECIAL SKILLS OUR GUESTS NORMALLY KEEP HIDDEN
I'VE GOT A LOT OF VEGETARIANS IN MY FAMILY AND IT'S DIFFICULT
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SELF CONFIDENCE ABOUT MANY OF MY TALENTS
TIME TO SEE JUST WHAT HOLLY CAN DO WITH A PING PONG BALL
COUNTING LETTERS IN WORDS
WHAT IS YOUR VERDICT AND WHY IS THAT YOUR VERDICT
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH THE JURY
THE WINNER OF THE HIDDEN TALENT AWARD IS
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS AWARD THIS WEEK'S LUCAS OF LUCASES
THAT GOES TONIGHT TO THE CHIRIES GUEST
WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED
THEREFORE IN THIS TERRAIN
GO WITHOUT HAVING EVERYTHING SORT OF
SO WE'VE SHUT THE AIRCRAFT DOWN
PARTICULARLY OVER THE GLASGOW AREA
WHICH WAS THE AREA THAT THEY WANTED US TO TAKE THE CASUALTY
SO MY JOB AS THE AIRCRAFT COMMANDER
WAS TO TO WEIGH UP THE PROS AND CONS OF TRYING TO GET INTO GLASGOW BUT BUT ALSO
A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO AND THERE WAS A CAR SAT THERE WITH A GENTLEMAN IN IT
AND YOU JUST GO INTO
LET'S HOPE SOME OF THAT MAGIC RUBS OFF ON US AS WE GO TO THE AUCTIONS IN MALVERN
WHICH WAS KNOWN AS THE HOFNER VIOLIN BASE
AND THIS IS WHERE IT GETS EXCITING
ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN
AND HERE'S WHAT WE'RE TAKING WITH US
SO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED
GO TO AS MANY SALES AS YOU CAN
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
IF YOU LOOK AROUND YOU
IN WHICH CASE THE SERVANTS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY HAVE WHAT IS CALLED GIVING ROOM
BUT IN THE GEORGIAN DESIGN
YOU SIMPLY TURNED ROUND
BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE
GUARANTEEING YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS SECURITY IN LIFE
BUT AT LEAST YOU HAD A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD
I SAW YOU OUTSIDE
AND THEN HE BOUGHT THE COMPANY FROM THEM
IT'S BEEN A FUN DAY FULL OF MAGIC
MAYHEM AND MARVELLOUS ANTIQUES
WE'VE GOT SOME JEWELRY
I DON'T FANCY YOU
ADULTERY ISN'T A CRIME
WHERE YOU SLEPT WITH OTHER MEN
GET ME QUESTIONED
CAN THEY STAY AHEAD AND BEAT THE PACK
YOU CAN WIN UP TO TWELVE
BEAT THE PACK AND EARNED THE RIGHT TO RETURN AS OUR CONTROL PLAYER ON TODAY'S SHOW
IN SOUTH AMERICA
SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT
POLICE SUPPORT STAFF
APPRENTICE CARPENTER FROM HAMPSHIRE
RETIRED SENIOR FINANCIAL ANALYST
MURDER MYSTERY THEATRE COMPANY OWNER
BUT IF HE GETS A QUESTION WRONG AT ANY TIME
I'LL JUST REPLACE IT WITH AN EASIER ONE BUT IT WILL COST HIM
THE MONEY HALVES EVERY TIME SEAN PASSES
A DOUBLE ANSWER
HENCE MY ANSWER
NOT SO BRILLIANT
HIS GAME OVER IN A FLASH
THE MONEY HE'S BANKED GOES WITH HIM
THANKS FOR BEING HERE
BUT SADLY SHE'S NOW GONE AND SO IS THE MONEY THAT SHE MANAGED TO BANK
LIKE ALL THE OTHER CATEGORIES
THIS ONE'S WORTH UP TO TWO THOUSAND POUNDS FOR YOU
WE'RE IN THE FINAL
AND WIN UP TO TWELVE
SEE YOU NEXT TIME
ARE WE GOING TO BE INTERFERING
AND THEY WERE SPLIT
AND OF COURSE THEY'RE HERE TO ASK OUR EXPERTS THAT ALL IMPORTANT QUESTION
AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THEIR SLEEPING QUARTERS
IT'S A VERY LIGHT GAUGE FRAME
THE COASTGUARD HAD A SECONDARY ROLE
WHO THE PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED
WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE LIKE
TO THE VOLUNTEERS
THE COASTGUARD RESCUE TEAMS
I'VE GOT MY MOBILE PHONE WITH ME
I'VE CALLED NINE NINE NINE
THEY'RE SENDING A TEAM OUT
I'VE GOT A VAGUE IDEA OF WHERE I AM
BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE SO
PAUL ALWAYS SAYS ABOUT QUALITY AND
A RUSSIAN SILVER CIGARETTE BOX BELONGING TO JOHN
AN UMBRELLA ORGANISATION THAT UNITES FOURTEEN UK HUMANITARIAN AID AGENCIES
BUT TO HELP THE VAST NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AFFECTED
THEY NEED YOUR DONATION
PLEASE HELP IF YOU CAN
HOW DO YOU THINK SHE'S GOING TO REACT
HOW WOULD ANYONE REACT
HOWEVER IF SHE DOESN'T LIKE A QUESTION
BUT IT WILL COST HER
BUT IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR THE PACK BECAUSE SOMEONE IS ABOUT TO GAIN CONTROL
BUT DIDN'T FOLLOW HER GUT INSTINCT
WAS THAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO
MAKING THE WRONG DECISION AT THE WRONG TIME
DESPITE BEING SUCH A GOOD PLAYER
I THOUGHT HE HAS TO GO
CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO GO FOR IT
GOING DOWN THERE
THAT'S THE BEST PLACE FOR HIM
IT'S ALL DONE WHEN I GET THERE
THAT THERE MUST REALLY BE AS MANY PASSOVER MEALS AS THERE ARE JEWS
VEGETABLEY THINGS WHICH WHICH WE NEVER HAD
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO EAT BREAD
AND I REMEMBER THAT VERY VIVIDLY AS A CHILD AND
WE DON'T HAVE ANY GRAINS
WE DON'T HAVE ANY PULSES
UM RUNNING AROUND THE KITCHEN AND
THE STORY OF POVERTY
THE STORY OF HOPE
IT'S ALL IN THERE
IT'S ALWAYS CHICKEN
SO HOWEVER OLD I AM
HOSTING MY FIRST SEDER
ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN
WE DRINK FOUR CUPS OF WINE
IT'S SPREAD OUT OVER THREE OR FOUR HOURS
DOING THE THING OUT OF DUTY
SORT OF FEELING IT A LITTLE BIT
YOU KNOW WAS ALL THIS ESCAPE FROM EGYPT
THE FIRST THING WE DID
I REMEMBER THE OLD HABIT CAME
EVEN NOW I'M QUITE EMOTIONAL ABOUT THAT AND
I REMEMBER MY GRANDMOTHER SAYING
JUST SHOWING THAT THERE ARE AS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF JUDAISM AS THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF JEW
WHY ARE WE BEHAVING LIKE THIS
MY FATHER WAS BROUGHT UP IN EGYPT
AND MY MOTHER IS AN ASHKENAZI SWISS JEW
SO I WAS BROUGHT UP WITH THIS ODD CONUNDRUM THAT IT WAS BOTH VERY IMPORTANT THAT I WAS JEWISH
I WAS QUITE READY TO BELIEVE THAT ELIJAH MIGHT ACTUALLY SHOW UP
SO A LOT OF THE TRADITIONAL DISHES THAT YOU MAKE ARE NOT THINGS THAT WE WOULD HAVE
WE CAN PROBABLY SWITCH BACK TO WHITE LIGHT
HANGING ONTO THE WALL WITH THESE BACK LEGS
THE LARGEST SPECIES OF CENTIPEDE FOUND ON EARTH
YOU'LL BE INVITED TO GO ON TO THE NEXT STAGE
I WON'T LET ANYONE DOWN
I RECKON IF I REALLY
REALLY TRIED MY HARDEST
SIR WILL SUFFICE
I AM YOUR MOTHER
I WANT TO GO ON THE TRIP
TOOK FULL IMPACT OF THE BLAST
THE TYPHOID VACCINATION AND
IF YOU'RE REALLY THAT DETERMINED TO GET TO NEPAL
ALL WITH A CHANCE TO WIN THOUSANDS OF POUNDS
CAN THEY STAY AHEAD AND BEAT THE PACK
THE SHOW WHERE IF YOU CAN STAY AHEAD OF YOUR OPPONENTS
YOU CAN WIN UP TO TWELVE
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THE MONEY
I'D DEFINITELY SPEND IT ON A BIG FAMILY HOLIDAY
BUILDER FROM NORWICH
SALES CONSULTANT FROM LEICESTERSHIRE
FUN CASINO OWNER FROMLINT
AND THAT'S NOT ALL
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT
PO QUESTION ON CARRY ON FILMS
MY MUM USED TO REALLY ENJOY THEM
BECAUSE BEING AN ACTOR
MAYBE SHE KNOWS A BIT ABOUT THE OTHER CATEGORIES
YOU WERE A VULNERABLE MEMBER OF THE PACK
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN
IT'S KNOWING WHEN TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS AS WELL
ALL THE MONEY SHE BANKED HAS GONE AS WELL BUT IT MEANS THAT I HAVE A VACANCY NEXT TO ME
JUST EXPLAIN THIS TO ME
TO SEE SOME FAMILY OUT THERE
SHE COULD WALK AWAY WITH FOUR THOUSAND
THAT WAS SHORT AND SWEET WASN'T IT
KATE'S GAME IS OVER JUST LIKE THAT SO ONCE AGAIN WE TURN BACK TO THE PACK
SO PASSING AT THIS STAGE IS REALLY RISKY
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO GO FOR IT
I DON'T SEE IT AS GETTING KICKED OUT
AND HERE WE ARE IN THE FINAL
OUR VERY THOUGHTFUL
THANKS FOR WATCHING
WHAT IF IT'S NOT WORKING
I'VE BEEN IN THAT LIMBO EVER SINCE
KEITH HAD A HEART CONDITION
AND WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT
AND I UNDERSTAND THE SIGNS
CUT OFF FROM THE WORLD
THE RULES ARE VERY SIMPLE
AT THE END OF THE SERIES
HE WAS A REALLY GOOD SINGER
AND THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
ALL WITH A CHANCE TO WIN THOUSANDS OF POUNDS
ONLY ONE WILL START IN CONTROL
YOU CAN WIN UP TO TWELVE
I'M NOW RETIRED
BUT THEN THAT CAN BE REALLY EMBARRASSING
AND ALSO I HAVE ONE SON WHO'S IN GLASGOW
HES DONE JUST GRADUATED FROM GLASGOW SCHOOL ABOUT
HEATING COMPANY DIRECTOR
SHE LOSES CONTROL
BUT IF SHE GETS A QUESTION WRONG AT ANY TIME
UM BUT I WASN'T SURE IF IT WAS THE ONLY ONE
NOT A PIECE OF TISSUE PAPER BETWEEN THEM
NOT WITH THIS ONE
I'M NOT I'M NOT BEING CURRENT UP TO YOU KNOW STAGE MUSICALS AT THE MOMENT BUT
UM I THINK IF I WAS I WAS MORE DEFINITE ABOUT ONE THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO BE OR TWO THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO BE BUT
I THINK I KNOW THE RIGHT ANSWER
EVERY TIME I'VE GIVEN YOU A ONE
THAT TYPE OF THING
FLAUBERT WAS FAR TOO SERIOUS
GASTON LERU WAS MORE OF A SENSATIONAL NOVELIST
SO THAT'S THE ONE I'M GOING WITH
THEN I HAD TWINS
BAD NEWS FOR THE PACK
MICHAEL JACKSON WAS ALL OF IT
AH YOUVE MADE THE RIGHT DECISIONS AT THE RIGHT TIME
AND THE CHANCE TO WIN UP TO TWELVE
LOADS OF CORRECT ANSWERS
BUILDING UP THE MONEY
DAWN CAME AND WENT JUST LIKE THAT
AGAINST ALL THE ODDS
LET'S PLAY THE BEAT THE PACK FINAL
YOU'VE GOT FELON LOGS
MOUNTAIN BIKING ACCIDENTS
HE'S NOT GOT ANY NECK OR BACK PAIN
WHEN WE HAD ANOTHER OPTION OF THE HIGHLINE
FIRST OF ALL IS TO
AND THAT'S A FANTASTIC
WHY DO I HAVE TWO PAIRS OF GLASSES
WHAT'S IT WORTH
IT LOOKS LIKE THE WHOLE OF STOCKPORT HAS ARRIVED FOR OUR VALUATION DAY
AND I THOUGHT I'D HAVE A QUICK CHAT TO ADAM PARTRIDGE
STEPH CANNOT BE WITH ME
THIS COULD SUIT IT AND IT'S GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY
STEPH WILL BE SO PLEASED WITH THAT THAT
WHAT WHAT DO YOU FOCUS ON
WHERE DID YOU GO
THE DAY BEFORE THE BIG EVENT
SORRY ABOUT THAT
OVER THE CENTURIES
THIS REGION HAS GENERATED A LOT OF STRONG CHARACTERS
WHILE I WAS HERE IN THE AREA
BUT HE ALSO LIKED TO BREAK THE RULES
AS THE NAME SUGGESTS
THE GREAT ITALIAN ARTIST
I NEED THE MONEY
DRAGGING ANOTHER ONE OUT OF YOU
THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS IN NORTHERN ART
IF YOU'VE GOT SOME
ARE YOU EXCITED
HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE SHOW THAT GIVES THE AWARDS OTHER SHOWS DON'T GIVE
HENRY THE EIGHTH HAD THE RIGHT IDEA
FOR THE LUCAS
YOU SORT OF HATE THIS SUBJECT MORE THAN ME
I LOVE A NICE BIG JUICY PEAR
LIKE JULIAN AND SANDY
SOMEONE ASKED ME IF I WAS ACTUALLY A MAN DRESSED AS A WOMAN
THE WINNER OF THE LUCAS FOR PEOPLE YOU'D KILL IF MURDER WERE LEGAL IS
SOME MEN DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THEY AREN'T BALD
THEY PUT ON WIGS
THEY LIE DOWN UNDERNEATH AN OSTRICH SO THAT PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE AN EGG
WATCHING HIM ON TELEVISION
FROM ARDMAN PRODUCTIONS
AND I TOLD HIM THAT WHEN I WAS A CHILD I WROTE TO MORPH AND MORPH DIDN'T WRITE BACK
DID YOU WRITE INTO ANY TV PROGRAMS EVER
BUT WHEN THEY SAID
SECURITY GUARD I STARTED TO MOVE IN BECAUSE NOT MANY PEOPLE KNEW WHO I WAS ANYWAY AN IRISH GUY
SHOULD DROP SOME LEGS
I SHOULD SLAM ALL OF THE LONDON YOUTH
CALLED MR MCQUEEN
AT MY PRIMARY SCHOOL
I CAN APPLY MY METHODS TO THIS KIND OF CRISIS
EVERYBODY'S JUST GOING
AND THEN THAT WOULD MAKE ME LAUGH
AND TO HIDE THE LAUGHTER FROM THE TEACHER I USED TO HOLD MY NOSE
I'D NEVER DONE IT IN MY WHOLE LIFE AT ALL
WHAT IS YOUR VERDICT AND WHY
I LIVE IN ASHFORD IN MIDDLESEX
STAYING THERE TWELVE FOURTEEN HOURS A DAY
TERMS BUT NOT IN LIFE
KNIGHTSBRIDGE WOULD CERTAINLY DO US BOTH PROUD I
WHOEVER ANSWERS THE MOST CORRECTLY WINS ITS A SIMPLE
HOW COULD YOU RISK EVERYTHING WE HAD
SOMETHING FAIRLY MUNDANE
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PROFOUND
THAT WAS AN INVITATION
FAVOUR I NEED TO ASK
THE GOOD THINGS
ALL WITH A CHANCE TO WIN THOUSANDS OF POUNDS
ONLY ONE WILL START IN CONTROL
YOU CAN WIN UP TO TWELVE
OUR ONLINE SELLER FROM COVENTRY MANAGED TO BEAT THE PACK AND EARN THE RIGHT TO RETURN AS OUR CONTROL PLAYER ON
SHE JUST FLUFFED IT
I NEED BEN TO MAKE A MISTAKE
I'LL SIMPLY REPLACE IT WITH AN EASIER ONE
BUT THAT WILL COST HIM
THIS TO I JUST LIVED IN MELBOURNE
YOU CAN GIVE ME TWO ANSWERS TO ANY OF THE QUESTIONS
IF HE DOESN'T LIKE A QUESTION
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT
BUT WHAT DID THEY CALL IT
SO JEAN WAS NOT ONE OF THE TWO MEMBERS TO GET THAT RIGHT
AND OF ALL THE REMAINING CATEGORIES
BUT I REALLY DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT BEN SAID
I KNEW IT LAST TIME AND I WASN'T BRAVE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PLAYING
IF YOU GO FOR IT AND YOU GET IT WRONG AT ANY TIME IN THIS GAME
THAT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY
YOU LEAVE WITH NOTHING
THOUSAND POUNDS GOES WITH HIM
AND BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER
I'M A WOMAN WITH A TRANS HISTORY
AND TELL US WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING
I'M SECRETARY OF NORTHERN PRIDE EVENTS LIMITED
YOU ARE BOTH AT RISK
YOU'RE SAFE AGAIN
GO TO THE SAFE AREA
AND THE BEST PLAYER UNTIL THIS POINT TAKES SUE'S PLACE
IT WAS JUST THE LUCK OF THE DRAW
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE ONE YOU WITH
SILVER FOR CHINA
BUT ONLY IF THEY CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT PHILIP HAS JUST MANAGED
AND BEAT THE PACK
BUT I THINK THE FLAVOUR'S BETTER
AND SO NAVIGATION ISN'T EASY AT THE BEST OF TIMES
ONE FIRST THING
IF THERE'S ANY WAX IN THERE
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN PLASTER CASTS OF HUMAN BODIES LIKE THE ONES THEY HAVE HERE
IS PRIMARILY A FUNCTION OF HOW MUCH GAS IS IN THE MAGMA
THEY'RE ALL BITS AND PIECES OF THE MAGMA
CHIPPING AWAY THAT ROCK TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD FIND
WE'VE GOT A SERIES OF X-RAYS THAT RICHARD CAN WORK FROM
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOT THEM LEFT ANYWHERE ELSE BUT
IT'S PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE AS THE STUFF OF COMEDY AND THE STUFF OF DRAMA
IT'S OPEN SEASON AND PEOPLE ARE MAKING UP FOR FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OF CHRISTIANS TELLING THEM WHAT TO THINK AND
IT'S OPEN SEASON AND THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING UP FOR FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OF CHRISTIANS TELLING THEM WHAT TO
THOUSAND YEAR OLD STORY
THOSE THINGS OFFEND ME
AND THAT MUST BE
IT ISN'T SPECIAL AND DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING ELSE
AND TIME PLAYS A BIG PART IN THAT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT'S PASSED BETWEEN A THING HAPPENING AND
IT WAS NOT ONE STEP TOO FAR
THEY MEET EACH OTHER OUTSIDE THE CHURCH
IN ORDER TO VIEW IT
WHY COULDN'T YOU SEE THAT
I WISH I HADN'T SEEN IT
AND THAT IS VERY SACRED
THAT IS THE PERSON OF JESUS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
NOW I THINK THAT YOU WOULD NOT
WHO DIED FOR US
WE ARE COMMEMORATING THAT DEATH
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE
NOT THE CONTENT OF BELIEF ITSELF
BLESSED ARE THE CHEESEMAKERS
WILL ACTUALLY NOW FIND THEMSELVES THINKING
I CERTAINLY COULDN'T GET WORKED UP ABOUT IT
I THOUGHT IT WAS AMUSING
I WAS A TEENAGER AT THE TIME
UM I'VE SEEN IT SINCE
I STILL LIKE IT
AND AGAIN IT'S BRIAN BEING CRUCIFIED
SO AGAIN YOU IT'S A DIFFERENT PERSON
WELL IF THEY'RE SAYING THAT BRIAN IS THE IS THE GUY JUST A FEW
YEAH WE'VE GOT JESUS ON THAT CROSS THERE
AND HAD ONLY APPEARED ONCE IN THE FILM
AND NOW IT SEEMS TO BE MUCH MORE
IT'S EASY TO PICK ON THE COMEDY AND SAY
IN FACT MOST COMEDIANS THINK WELL THERE CAN'T BE ANY CHRISTIANS HERE
THEY WOULDN'T BE AT COMEDY
BELIEVING IN A THING THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO US
THERE WAS A MEMORANDUM CIRCULATED WITHIN THE FOREIGN OFFICE
AND THIS WASN'T JUST A JOKE EMAIL BETWEEN A COUPLE OF COLLEAGUES
THAT MEMORANDUM WAS ACTUALLY CIRCULATED WITHIN THE FOREIGN OFFICE
I CAN'T KIND OF SPEAK FOR WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH AN INDIVIDUAL'S MIND WHEN THEY WROTE A PIECE BUT
WAS TO SAY THAT EVERYBODY WILL FEEL COMFORTABLE IF YOU DOWNGRADE THE MAJORITY
SO IF WE ALL STOP BEING
SOMEHOW MUSLIMS AND HINDUS AND JEWS WOULD FEEL MUCH MORE WELCOME
AS A BRITISH MUSLIM
IT HAPPENED IN THE LAST GOVERNMENT AND I THINK IT WAS RIGHT FOR THE FOREIGN OFFICE TO COME OUT AND
IN THE ACT OF PRAYER
IN COMEDY IS PEOPLE SAYING
YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT ABOUT MUSLIMS
AND IF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT RELIGION
WHICH CAN BE I THINK THE WAY THAT ISLAM MAY BE IN SOME WAYS IN THE COMEDY CIRCUIT
WELL FOR ME AS A BRITISH MUSLIM
A COUNTRY WITH A STRONG CHRISTIAN HERITAGE WITH VALUES BASED UPON THOSE CHRISTIAN VALUES MAKES IT
I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE TO REVERT TO A FANTASTIC QUOTE BY THE LAST ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
AND WHAT CAN BE QUITE HURTFUL
AND HE SEES AT THE HARDEST TIMES IN HIS LIFE
THERE'S ONLY ONE SET OF FOOTPRINTS AND HE IS VERY TROUBLED AND HE SAYS TO GOD
AND GOD SMILES AND HE LOOKS AT HIM HE SAYS
BRITAIN WAS PRODUCING MORE OF THIS THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
HE HAD NO CHOICE
IT WAS A MASSIVE
YOU HAD A REALLY REALLY HUGE
PEOPLE WERE APPALLED
THEY THOUGHT THEY'D SUFFOCATE
BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT
BUT NOW WE ARE ON THE COURSE AGAIN
FAR LESS THE REACH
WHICH FOR HIM WAS VALHALLA
THEIR BLOOD MIXED WITH OUR BLOOD
PLAYING TENNIS SHE SAYS
WHICH IS JUST AS WELL
I'LL NEVER LIVE THIS DOWN
EACH OF OUR FOUR CONTENDERS TONIGHT HAS WON AROUND ALREADY
SO THE PRESSURE IS ON
AND QUITE OFTEN
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
LIFE IN OUR COUNTRY CHANGED FOREVER
WORLD WAR II HAD BEGUN
IT WAS A TRULY HORRENDOUS EVENT
TO GET OUT IF THEY COULD
TRAINS WERE ARRANGED
GIVEN THESE TRAUMATIC EVENTS EARLY IN THEIR LIVES
REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL AT BUILDING NEW LIVES AND MAKING A TREMENDOUS CONTRIBUTION TO BRITISH
IT WAS JUST UNDER TEN THOUSAND
NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN
AND IF YOU NEEDED BACK UP
WHEN YOU FINISHED I LET YOU SLIDE DOWN THE POLE
THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE HEROES WITH GRIMY FACES
WELL OVER A YEAR WHEN AFS PERSONNEL WEREN'T REALLY DOING A LOT
ARMY DAUGHTERS BEING ONE OF THEM
THAT FIRE WAS SO ENORMOUS
IF I WOULD COMPARE THAT FOR YOU A TEN PUMP FIRE
WOULD MAKE THE NATIONAL NEWS TODAY
IT WOULD BE QUITE EERIE
I COULDN'T GET OUT
BECAUSE THE GIRL SITTING NEXT TO ME
YOU CAN'T BE SHOT
I HAVE BEEN SHOT
AND IT WAS THEN I REALISED WE WEREN'T FIRING AT METAL
UM TWO CHAPS GOT OUT OF IT
ALL WITH A CHANCE TO WIN THOUSANDS OF POUNDS
YOU CAN WIN UP TO TWELVE
THAT PLAYER IS REBECCA
FROM SOUTH YORKSHIRE
I THINK I NEED SOME CONFIDENCE
PLAY WITH SOME BOARD GAMES
IF SHE GETS JUST ONE QUESTION WRONG
IT'S HER DECISION
I'M AFRAID TO SAY
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
THE CONGO CROCODILE
I THOUGHT TE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN AMPHIBIAN
IS SHE HALFWAY TOWARDS THE FINAL WITH ANOTHER THOUSAND
ONE WRONG ANSWER
SO'S ALL THE MONEY SHE'S BANKED
I HAVE SEEN THAT
YOU THREW TO THE NEXT CATEGORY INTO THE SAFE AREA
I'VE ENJOYED YOUR SMILE THROUGHOUT THE GAME
THEN THIS CAUTIOUS APPROACH BY LIBBY REALLY HAS NOT PAID OFF
TIME TO FIND OUT
AND WHEN SOMEONE ELSE WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO WIN UP TO TWELVE
BUT ONLY IF THEY CAN DO WHAT LIBBY HAS DONE AND BEAT THE PACK
THANKS FOR WATCHING
WHICH THEY HAVEN'T DONE
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS WE DON'T KNOW
TWELVE MILLION OF US VISIT THEM EACH YEAR
IT'S BECOME A NATIONAL PASTIME
FOR ONE DAY ONLY
BUT I'VE I'VE NEVER WORN IT
ONCE THE MAN OF THE HOUSE
YOU CAN'T WITHDRAW IT RIGHT NOW
WE'RE LOOKING AT THREE TO FIVE HUNDRED POUND
FOURTH IT EVENTUALLY BECAME YOU'VE GUESSED IT BUCKINGHAM PALACE
WE HAVE FOUND SOME REAL GEMS
AND I'VE GOT MY FAVOURITES
YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT YOURS
WE' GOING TO SET OFF TO AUCTION FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME AND PUT THOSE VALUATIONS TO THE TEST
THERE WERE ONLY SEVEN
THOUSAND HOSPITAL BEDS AVAILABLE FOR SICK AND INJURED PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
SO BARCLEY SHEFFIELD AND HIS WIFE
KNEW THEY HAD TO ACT AND ACT FAST
SO THEY VOLUNTEERED NORMBY HALL AND THE ESTATE OVER TO THE WAR EFFORT
AT THE START OF THE GREAT WAR
SO WE'VE GOT SOME EXAMPLES HERE
MANY HAD TO PERFORM MINOR OPERATIONS AS WELL
THEY WERE ALL WELL LOVED BY THE MEN THEY WERE TREATING
WHEN THE GOOD LORD HANDED OUT BODIES
AND I'M PROBABLY BEING MEAN
SOMEBODY MIGHT LOVE THEM EVEN MORE THAN THAT
INSIDE THE HOUSE
AND THIS FINE PIECE OF KIT IS A HUNTING TABLE
ONE WITH PORT AND ONE WITH BRANDY
AND I HAD TO PARK THE COACH
AND THE OLDER I GET
BE THE LAST TO PUT IT UP
AND WE KEEP SAYING IT ON THIS SHOW
ONLY ONE WILL STARTING CONTROL
CAN THEY STAY AHEAD AND BEAT THE PACK
I TRY AND GET A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO THE COUNTRIES THAT I STUDY
WHETHER THAT'S IN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION OR IN AFRICA
YOU CAN WIN UP TO TWELVE
YOU ARE STARTING IN CONTROL
YOU COULD WALK AWAY WITH UP TO TWELVE
MENTAL HEALTH SOCIAL WORKER FROM MANCHESTER
IT IS THE BEST JOB
IF HE DOESN'T LIKE A QUESTION
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT
CHARLES DICKENS IS OUR FIRST CATEGORY AND THIS IS THE TWO
THERE ARE NO SECOND CHANCES
LET'S LOCK THAT IN
I KNOW WHO HE IS
I KNOW HE'S VERY TALL
YOUR MONEY IS GETTING BIGGER AND WE ARE NOW FOUR CATEGORIES AWAY FROM TODAY'S FINAL
THE BBC CLASSIC
SO I'M GOING TO GET RID OF SARAH
BUT GENERAL FOOD
I'M NOT TOO BAD
MY KNOWLEDGE IS VERY SPECIFIC IN MUSIC AND THERE'S NO MUSIC CATEGORIES UP THERE
SO I THINK I'M GOING TO KNOCK OUT KNOCK OUT MATT
I'M REALLY SORRY
PLEASE LEAVE THE
MAKES THINGS EASIER FOR YOU
BUT MAKES IT EASIER FOR THE PACK
AND YOU'RE AWARE THAT BY PASSING
THE QUESTIONS GET EASIER
I THINK THE ACTUAL PAVLOVA HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME
AND THE EQUATOR STILL RUNS THROUGH KENYA
YOU MUST LEAVE THE PACK
DISNEY THEME PARKS
THOSE TYPES OF PLACES
AND MAKE SURE YOU JOIN ME NEXT TIME
WHEN SOMEONE ELSE WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO WIN UP TO TWELVE
SHOW THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND BEAT THE PACK
SPITTING AT THINGS
THEN INTO INTO AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING JOB
AS WELL AS THAT
THE OTHER THING IS
THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT THIS
ONE IS SELLING IT ALL TOGETHER
THAT'S THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND THAT SEEMS A SHAME
THAT'S THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
WILL OUR EXPERTS BE ON THE MONEY
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT IN JUST A MOMENT
HERE'S A QUICK RECAP
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME HERE STANFORD
THE LARKIN FAMILY
MISERABLE SPRING LIKE THIS
WHICH GIVES US THAT PRECIOUS EXTRA OUT WHEN WE WANT IT
AND THEN IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN
IF YOU CAN ADD LOTS OF CARBON
WHICH YOU GET IN THE DRIED OUT STEMS OF GRASSES
PUT DOWN THE SOIL FOR A FEW
VISIT SOMEONE ELSE'S GARDEN AND GET SOME INSPIRATION
YOU MAY WELL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE END OF APRIL
ALL THE CONNECTIONS
WE USE THEM HERE ALL THE TIME
BUT WIND IS IMPORTANT TOO
SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COAL FRAME OR A GREENHOUSE
MANY MANY HOURS OF SEARCHING
LOOKING THROUGH ALL KINDS OF OLD DOCUMENTS
ALTHOUGH THERE'S SOMETHING OF A CHANCE THAT IT COULD HAVE DIED IN THE SIXTEENTH
TO WITNESS HIS AGONY
AND THEY WENT THEIR WAY
BLESSED BE THE KINGDOM OF OUR FATHER DAVID
ONE OF YOU WHICH EATETH WITH ME SHALL BETRAY ME
THEY WENT OUT INTO THE MOUNT OF OLIVES
AND BEGAN TO BE SORE AMAZED
AND WHEN THEY HAD CRUCIFIED HIM
AND STOOPING DOWN
COULD REASONABLY MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT SOMEBODY WOULD BE THAT FANATICAL ENOUGH AND ABLE TO PERSUADE HIS
AND AT THE TIME HE HADN'T LONG BEEN MARRIED TO ANNIE AND
IN FRONT OF HIM WAS A COPY OF TIME OUT
I'VE GOT MONEY IN THE BANK
SO I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY
THAT'S JUST HIS NATURE
AND WE USED TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF COMEDY TO BE DERIVED FROM THE OBLIGATIONS OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND THE FACT
BECAUSE I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING
AND THEN ON SUNDAY EVENING
WE HAVE A CAR CRASH
AND POSSIBLY EVEN IN MARTIN'S CASE YOUR BRAIN
THEY NOW CALL THE WATER COOLER MOMENT WHEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE LAST EPISODE
IT IS STILL TERRIBLY FUNNY
AND IF YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THE PREDICAMENT OF THE PEOPLE
BUT IT CAME STRAIGHT DOWN AGAIN WHEN I SAW IT
BECAUSE THEY MAKE IT LOOK EASY
DOES HE WANT ME TO SWEAR
MY WIFE MYRA WOULD ALSO SAY TO ME
HED NEVER DO IT
THEY PUT PARAFFIN ON IT
SO I' I SORT OF GO BACK TO MY LINES
RICHARD AND HE WERE VERY CLOSE
MAY REIGN WITH HIM IN GLORY
TWO THOUSAND YEARS LATER
AS WE ARE FED WITH THE BREAD OF HEAVEN
BLESSED ARE YOU
LET US DRAW NEAR TO GOD AND OFFER HIM OUR PRAYER AND THANKSGIVING
BLESSED ARE YOU
ON THE NIGHT OF HIS ARREST
BY THIS TIME OF YEAR
IT'S BEEN LOVELY HAVING IT TO OURSELVES
IF YOU'VE BEEN AWAY AND YOU COME BACK
WHAT DO YOU REALLY RELISH
WE DO DEPEND ON THE ELEMENTS AND SOMETIMES
IN STRAIGHT ROWS
WE DO WHAT WE CALL DEEP CLEANING
THAT'S IN THE CASTLE
SO PEOPLE CAN COME OUT AND BUY IT
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS
SO WITH THE HIVES STARTING TO BECOME ACTIVE AGAIN
AND AS THIS IS EASTER SUNDAY
TO BE BORN BRITISH WAS TO WIN THE FIRST PRIZE IN LIFE
YOU'VE GOT TO REALLY GET AS MUCH OUT OF THE WATER AS POSSIBLE
AND WE YOU WE JUST DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WAS GOING TO WORK
IT REALLY IS SENSUOUS
SKIPPER WANTS ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE FAMILY JEWELS ARE OK
FRANKLY IT'S INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME
IT'S EASY TO SAY WHEN YOU JUDGE SOMETHING FROM FOURTEEN
SITTING IN THE COMFORT OF A PLUSH OFFICE
HIM KIND OF UPSET BECAUSE I HAD BROKEN THE RECORD
SLAP ON THE BACK
YOUR WORLD RECORD BREAKER
LOOK AFTER YOURSELF
IT WAS THE REWARD
AS IT TURNED OUT
BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF ANY SOUND
EVEN TO THIS DAY
AND A GENUINE HERO
ON THE OTHER HAND
HE WASN'T A POMPOUS GIT
IT HAS BEEN KNOWN
AS A MODERN MAN
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
I HAVE READ THIS STORY ACTUALLY
A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY IT
AS YOU'VE JUST SAID
SO THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND WHICH
THUNDER IN THE MOUNTAINS
THOUSAND POUND SAYS THEY DON'T
HE NEEDED THAT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS ATTEMPT TO BEAT POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ TEAM IN
I'M SIXTY THREE AND I'M A RETIRED OIL INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE
SO IS MONTE CARLO
BUT I'VE REALLY GOT NOTHING TO BASE THIS ON
SO I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO PRETTY MUCH TAKE A GUESS
MY FRENCH ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE EPOISSES
SO THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS IT'S TIME FOR OUR FINAL ROUND
I WOULD GUESS RUSSIA
MY NAME'SQUI
I'M SIXTY FOUR YEARS OLD AND I'M AINA
I SHOULD THINK IT'S PROBABLY EMMERDALE
I AUTOMATICALLY ASSOCIATE MANDRILLS WITH AFRICA
I'M GOING TO SAY SCRUM HALF
AND WON THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN AGAIN
WHAT GOES WITHDO
YOU PUT THE PIE DISH ONTO A HOT OVEN TRAY
BOTTOM GETS HOT
A LARGE PART OF THE RELIGION LOST
COMBINE THOSE TWO
THEY ARE VERY HARD
IF YOU CUT THEM UP AND BOIL THEM
THESE ARE REALLY ROBUST POTATOES
OUR PET OR COBBLER
AND I TELL YOU SOMETHING
ONCE YOU HAVE TASTEED IT
YOUR BAROMETER OF COMFORT FOOD IS GOING TO NEED TO BE RESET
SO WHAT WE DO NOW IS
WE PUT IT INTO A PREHEATED OVEN
ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES CELSIUS FOR A FAN OVEN FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES
BUT A CHOCOLATE
IT WOULD JUST LOOK HEAVIER
BUT IN ACTUAL FACT
VERY WAFER THIN
IS HOW CRISPS WERE BORN
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NICE
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS ATTEMPT TO BEAT POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ TEAM IN
PLEASE COME BACK
THE WAR SITUATION HAS TURNED
WHAT MADE YOU REMEMBER THAT
IS THAT UNUSUAL
HITCHCOCK USED ONE PARTICULAR PERSON SEVERAL TIMES
BUT ALREADY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHICH WAS WHICH
COMPOSED OF THOUSANDS OF MINIATURE CLAY FIGURES
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND WHICH
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS
THIS WEEK JUST ELEVEN BAKERS REMAIN
YOU'RE HALFWAY THROUGH YOUR QUICHE CHALLENGE
WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE HIS SUITS OF ARMOUR
DON'T COME HOME
AS THEY SAY IN FRANCE
COURSE WHEN THESE FAMOUS PEOPLE ENDORSED THIS PUDDING
ABOVE ALL OTHERS
AND THEY WERE VERY VERY KEEN ON THE IDEA
SPICY AND IT'S SWEET
AND DUSTED IT OFF
IS ONE OF THE TASTIEST DISHES TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET
AND YOU KNOW CNN DID A SURVEY AND THIRTY FIVE
I MUST HAVE TO GO MASTERMIND
KEEP AN EYE IT DOESN'T BOIL DRY
IT IS WORTH REMEMBERING A SENSE OF OCCASION
AS IN THAT CNN POLL
SO MUCH SO THAT
WHERE EVERYBODY WAS FAMILIAR WITH IDEAS LIKE THE BLACK MARKET BECAUSE OF THEIR WARTIME EXPERIENCES
SHORTLY AFTER HE WAS BORN
IN THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE
AND THAT LED TO A CHAIN OF HAIRDRESSING SALONS
AND HAD SID REMAINED FAITHFUL TO HIS WIFE
SO IT WAS QUITE LATE ON
THAT REALLY WAS HIM BUT
BUT HE IT WAS AN ACT
UM AND A DAMN GOOD ONE
THE BRITISH FILM INDUSTRY WAS VERY MUCH SUPPORTED
IT WAS THE HEYDAY OF THE THE RANK ORGANISATION
THE CARRY ON FILMS
THERE WERE LOTS OF BRITISH FILMS BEING MADE
I THINK BRITISH FILMS THAT PERHAPS WEREN'T AS GRANDIOSE AS THEY HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY
HIS PARENTS WERE IN TIRE
THEY WERE A BIT MORE DOWN TO EARTH
A BIT MORE LIGHT
FAMILY COMEDY TYPE MOVIES
WHICH IS PERFECT FOR SOMEONE LIKE SID
SO IT WAS A VERY EARLY HORROR FILM
HE'S A VARIATION ON THOSE SPIV CHARACTERS THAT WE'VE SEEN BEFORE
BUT THIS IS A REAL LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION
SO GREAT QUOTE
IF YOU PLAY TENNIS WITH A BUNNY RABBIT
DO YOU KNOW THAT QUOTE
AGAIN VERY CANNY MAN
HE KNEW HANCOCK WAS A COMEDIAN
SO THERE WAS A GREAT PARTNERSHIP
OF HANCOCK RUNNING RINGS AROUND HIM
HE NEEDED A SCRIPT TO WORK FROM
BUT AS THOSE SHOWS WENT ON
TAKE ON ALL COMERS
SO HE SO HE BECAME HIS CREATION
IN THE FURNITURE
THAT YOU DON'T MIND ACTUALLY BECOMING
BUT IF ANYONE ANNOYED HIM
HE NEVER TURNED DOWN ANY JOB
BUT HANCOCK WAS THE MAIN TURNING POINT FOR HIM
HE ALSO WANTED TO BE A MOVIE STAR
HE WAS VERY SHY WHEN HE FIRST DID THE HANCOCK RADIO SHOW
AND I THINK IT WAS A PREMIERE
I'VE ONLY JUST HEARD THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE IN THE NEXT HANCOCK'S
AND HE WAS NEARLY IN TEARS
HE DIDN'T REALISE IT WAS ACTUALLY FILMED IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE
VERY VERY UPSET BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN CLOSE FRIENDS
YOU COULDN'T SEE HIS FACE AT ALL AND HE WOULDN'T LOOK AT THE AUDIENCE
BEING TAXI DRIVERS
THAT WAS THE KIND OF IRONY OF IT
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY A BIT AWKWARD WITH THE PUBLIC
BUT THE PUBLIC SAW HIM AS ONE OF THEM
HE MORE OR LESS PLAYS HIMSELF EVERY TIME HE APPEARS
HE WAS ALMOST AS FAMOUS AS HANCOCK
CONSTABLE TO TO PLAY
NOT SO MUCH OF THE THE BAWDY CHARACTER HE LATER WENT ON TO PORTRAY IN THE FILMS BUT
AND THAT MIGHT SEEM A SLIGHTLY ODD THING TO SAY BECAUSE YOU HE WASN'T A CRIMINAL
AND THEN AFTER HE'D COMPLETED HIS
HE WASN'T A COWBOY
THEY JUST SEEMED TO HIT IT OFF TOGETHER
CONSTABLE IS IS QUITE UNUSUAL BECAUSE HE'S HE'S SORT OF IN CHARGE
THEY DID START OFF PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE THE EIAN COMEDIES
HE SORT OF BROUGHT THAT BAWDINESS TO THEM THAT WE REALLY ASSOCIATE WITH CARRY ON FILMS
THAT WAS THE THE STYLE THAT WE REALLY ASSOCIATE WITH THEM NOW
AND IT'S IT'S ODD TO SEE HIM IN THAT POSITION OF AUTHORITY BECAUSE WE KNEW HIM LATER ON
THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT WAS
THERE IS NO AUDIENCE BUT IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S VERY AWARE THAT PEOPLE WILL BE LAUGHING OUT LOUD
AND THERE IS ALMOST THAT
THEY WERE THE SAME BASIC CHARACTER WITH
BUT THERE'S HORRIBLE INTENT BEHIND IT
TO SAY IT IN THE RIGHT WAY AND HAVE THE RIGHT FACE
HE'S SURROUNDED BY WOMEN IN MINIIRTS
YOU NEED ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE IN IT
IT JUST WASN'T QUITE THE SAME
THEY WERE NEVER QUITE THE SAME WITHOUT HIM BECAUSE THE LEEINESS OF THE CARRY ON FILMS
THE CARRY ON FILMS WERE WERE ROLLED OUT AT THE RATE OF A COUPLE A YEAR
HE WAS VERY PROTECTIVE OF THE FEMALE MEMBERS OF THE CAST
HE WAS ACTUALLY QUITE RESPECTFUL
HE WAS A GENTLEMAN
AS SOON AS I MENTION YOUR NAME
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THE CARRY ON FILMS
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID
WHO WEREN'T REALLY PART OF IT
SID WAS NO LONGER THE LECH
SHE WAS NO LONGER CHASING AFTER THE WOMEN
HE HAD RESPONSIBILITY
HE HAD A FAMILY
HE STILL LIKED A GOOD DRINK
HE STILL LIKED A GOOD LAUGH
WHEN THEY WATCH A SOAP
AND IT JUST SEEMED TO WORK FOR HIM
IT WAS BELIEVABLE
A VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTER TO WHAT HE PLAYED IN THE CARRY ON FILMS
SID ABBOTT WAS VERY MUCH A FAMILY MAN
THERE WAS A VERY SOPHISTICATED MAN SITTING THERE WITH A GENTLE VOICE
THEY WERE NEVER LET DOWN
AND HE CAME ON AND HE WAS SO FRIENDLY
AND WE HAD TO WAIT FOR THE CLAPPING AND THE CHEERING TO STOP
IN PUBLIC SOMETIMES
IF THERE WAS AN AUDIENCE AS HE WAS COMING OUT OF THE STAGE DOOR OR SOMETHING
WE WERE NEARLY ALWAYS UP THERE
EIGHT O'CLOCK ON A MONDAY NIGHT
AND HE NEVER EVER COMPLAINED ABOUT FEELING UNWELL
EVEN THOUGH I KNEW THAT HE'D HAD A TINY TREMOR OR SOMETHING
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS
HE WAS BRILLIANT
SIX HUNDRED SQUARE METRES AT A GUIDE PRICE OF NINETY FIVE
AND RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE AS I SAID
THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT IS BY EITHER DROPPING THE HEIGHT OF THIS WALL TO ONE
THOSE THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE
THE OTHER THING IS
THE PLAN THAT WAS ADVERTISED
THAT'S A MAJOR RESULT
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT AND YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW HE GETS ON LATER IN THE SHOW
NOT LEAST MOVING THAT WALL AND THE SHARED DRIVEWAY
AND DECENT TRANSPORT LINKS
IT'S CERTAINLY GOT A LOT GOING FOR IT AND RATHER EXCITINGLY IT SEEMS TO HAVE SOME REALLY
OH DEAR IT'S QUITE SMALL IN HERE
THERE'S THE KITCHEN
THERE'S THE BEDROOM
THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE
FIRST AND FOREMOST THE PROPERTY IS CURRENTLY UNMORTGAGEABLE
IT'S UNLIKELY ANYBODY WILL LEND TO YOU WITH THAT LEASE LENGTH
IT'S GOING TO COST A LOT OF MONEY TO EXTEND AND I MEAN A LOT OF MONEY
SO IF YOU BUY THIS PLACE YOU HAVE TO PAY CASH AND THAT CASH WILL BE TIED UP IN THIS PLACE UNTIL YOU
THIS PROPERTY IS NOT A BAD INVESTMENT AT THE RIGHT PRICE BUT PAYING THE RIGHT PRICE IS CRUCIAL
NOW THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DOING IT
ONE WOULD NEED TO GET TWO THINGS DONE
THEN THEY NEED TO SPEAK TO A SPECIALIST IN LEASES TO LOOK AT GOING TO THE LVT
MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND OR SO THEY SAY
THOUSAND POUNDS AND I WOULD EXPECT AN OFFER BETWEEN FOUR FOUR FIFTY FOUR SEVEN FIVE
SOMETHING A WE BIT OUT OF THE WAY
APART FROM THE OCCASIONAL WHIFF FROM THE NEARBY LANDFILL SITE
SO DID OUR BUYER'S PLANS GET OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
I THOUGHT I WOULD DO BETWEEN FIVE
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY'S SHOW BUT WE'LL HAVE MORE TALES FROM THE FRONT LINE OF PROPERTY DEVELOPING
OR KILLER WHALES
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS ATTEMPT TO BEAT POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ TEAM IN
I'M THIRTY SEVEN AND I'M A MAJOR IN THE PARACHUTE REGIMENT
I'M THIRTY ONE AND I'M A LANCE CORPORAL
I'M THIRTY FIVE AND I'M ALSO A CORPORAL
WHAT WE NORMALLY DO IS WE PRA SOMETHING THE GROUND FIRST
WE CAN'T HEAR EACH OTHER IN THE AIR BECAUSE OF THE WIND RUSHING
THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE HAS BEEN PRIMARILY INVOLVED IN RESEARCHING
IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER
ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION YEARS AGO
WHEN THE DINOSAURS SO SUDDENLY AND DRAMATICALLY DISAPPEARED
SOLVED THAT PROBLEM BY BROADENING THEIR DIET
SO THE GIANT ANTA HAS TO DO ALL IT CAN TO CONSERVE ENERGY
FLIGHT AND THE ABILITY TO CATCH INSECTS ON THE WING IS AN EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENT
THAT IS A FEEDING BUZZ
HOW DO THEY SURVIVE DURING THE WINTER
WHEN THERE ARE NO FLYING INSECTS
AND A PHD STUDENT IN CHECK STUDIES
AND I'M DOING A PHD IN RUSSIAN
I THINK IT'S LEAD
JACKSON POLLOCK REJOICED IN THE WONDERFUL NICKNAME OF JACK THE DRIPPER
VERY GOOD QUESTION
WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
IT'S NOT THATCHER
BIG DOLLS' HOUSE IN WINDSOR
JULIUS WAS GROUCHING
SO WE HOPE IT'S CHICO
A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOU FANCY DOES YOU GOOD
BEEF AND PEPPER
BECAUSE IT ALWAYS IS DONE IN AN OVEN NOW
WELL LOOKED AFTER ANIMALS
BUT THE REALITY IS
WHAT HAPPENS IS
TIME OF GREAT POVERTY
WITH ME OXTAIL SOUP
WHITE VEAL IS THE VEAL THAT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO EAT
FOR ETHICAL REASONS
REALLY TOUGH GOING
I'M I'M QUITE A FAN OF A RENDANG
SO I MIGHT RULE THAT OUT
IT'S NOT GOING TO GO GREEN
I REALLY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS
BUT I WILL GO FOR THE STAPLE
I'D ALSO ELIMINATE FOR THE SAME BREEZE
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER
I'LL HAVE TO GO FOR BALLOONS
THOUSAND PAN SAYS THEY DON'T
VERY GOOD EATING
SO IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
WHEN IT'S COOLER
WHAT A BIT IN AWE OF OUR FOODY FRENCH NEIGHBOURS
WE CAN DO THIS AND ACTUALLY
WITH THE PRODUCE THAT WE HAVE IN THE UK
WHEN THEY GROW SLOWLY
IT'S A LOVELY PLACE
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE DELICATE WITH THIS
THIS GARLIC HAS THE SAME MAKEUP AS AS GARLIC WOULD HAVE HAD BACK IN THE EGYPTIAN
THE MORE SUN THE GARLIC GETS
YOU DON'T GET THAT
YOU'VE GOT A LOVELY FLAVOR FROM IT
YOU DON'T GET BAD BREATH
IT GIVES YOU ALL THE BENEFITS OF NOT HAVING GARLIC BUT HAVING GARLIC
IT WAS REALLY SCORNED ON AND THE UPPER CLASSES WOULDN'T DREAM OF EATING GARLIC
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
THEY BUILT ARTIFICIAL RIVERS CANALS
UP TO TWENTY OF THEM A YEAR
IT WAS FAMOUS FOR COAL
AND BY THE TIME OF HIS DEATH IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE
HAVING ALREADY MAPPED THE ROADS AND THE CANALS
HE PASSED HIS BUSINESS ON TO HIS THREE SONS
SHE'S BEEN OUT OF THE WATER FOR A FEW MONTHS BUT
BY THE END OF THE PROGRAMME
BECAUSE THAT'S THE VERY BEST TIME OF YEAR TO SEE BOXING HARES
AND THAT'S WHAT I' WILL BE INVESTIGATING LATER
MOST POPULAR BOOK
MAKE THEIR OWN MISTAKES
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TURNING OUR GREEN FINGERED SKILLS INTO A PROFESSION
WE'RE IN DANGER OF LOSING SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FEATURES OF OUR COUNTRYSIDE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL BE INVESTIGATING LATER
IT'S SEEN AS DIRTY
NOT ABOUT WHAT WE DO HERE
WHICH LEADS TO MAYBE A RECYCLING OF FIVE IDEAS
THE SECOND THING IS WE DON'T GET THAT NEW BLOOD COMING THROUGH
IF YOU COMPARE IT TO DUTCH ELM DISEASE
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE OF TACK
IF THEY WANT TO GROW THEIR ECONOMY
WE KNOW WE HAVE THE JOBS OUT THERE TO BRING PEOPLE IN
AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED FROM GOVERNMENT IS A CHANGE OF LANGUAGE
ALONGSIDE THE INDUSTRY
BUT THIS IS JUST A HANDFUL
I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF THOUSAND ANIMALS TO LOOK AT
SO LOTS TO CHOOSE FROM
BUT FIRST OF ALL
SADLY FOR GAINSBOROUGH
HE SOLD VERY FEW LANDSCAPE PAINTINGS DURING HIS LIFETIME
ON THE OTHER HAND
ACCORDING TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS
THIS WAS THE SORT OF THING THAT GAINSBOROUGH DID
WHEN HE LEFT SUFFOLK
SO I'VE GOT BROCCOLI FOR A TREE
WE HAD AN ISSUE WITH ACTUAL MOVEMENT ON THAT CEILING
SO WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THE STRUCTURE OF THE CEILING IS A BIT SUSPECT
WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW BIG A PROBLEM IT IS
SHE'S LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT
WHICH REDUCES THE BLOOD PRESSURE SO THAT SHE CAN ABSORB MORE OF A PROTEIN OUT OF A BLOODSTREAM
POSSIBLY THINGS COULD GO WRONG
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I THINK IS PROBABLY A KIDNEYS BUT
IF IT WAS A LONG PROCEDURE
AND SCATTERED IT FAR AND WIDE IT COULD TAKE THEM MAYBE AN HOUR
THAT'S WHEN THEY REALLY GET KEEN ON THE BANANA
AND THE WHOLE ISSUE OF WHETHER THE PLASTERWORK HAS REACHED THE END OF ITS SHELF LIFE
WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THE WHOLE CEILING TO BITS AND BASICALLY PUT IT BACK TOGETHER
MALES WILL USE THAT
THAT'S THE METHOD THEY USE TO FIGHT FOR THE FEMALES AND THEY WILL REALLY SLAM INTO EACH OTHER
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BLOWING THE WHISTLE
ANYTHING MAJOR WITH THE HOUSE
ALL THE HOUSE IS INCREDIBLY OLD
THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THE MOMENT
BEFORE WE DO THE REPAIR
WHY HAS IT HAPPENED AND
AND THAT'S WHAT THE ARCHITECTS AND SURVEYORS ARE LOOKING AT
THEY'LL REPORT TO US AND BEFORE WE DO ANY REPAIRS
THIS IS MY TERRITORY
PEOPLE WALKING AROUND IS HELPING ME
I NEEDED THEM TO KNOW THAT AT ANY TIME IF I NEED THEM IN AN EMERGENCY
I NEED TO GET HOLD OF ONE OF THEM
I NEED TO GIVE THEM A SIGNAL WITH SOMETHING
I'M FIFTY FOUR YEARS OLD
I'M SIXTY SEVEN YEARS OF AGE AND I'M A RETIRED FIELD DATA TECHNICIAN
WE HAVE SAM SMITH
I THINK SHAKESPEARE WROTE SONNET SO
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND WHICH IS
THOUSAND POUNDS SAYS THEY DON'T
A SINGLE ONE IS WORTH ABOUT A MILLION POUNDS
FAMOUSLY FUSSY IN THEIR FEEDING
THE CASE THAT IF YOU WANT TO SEE ONE
YOU CAN BE A GENERALIST
IT HAD A LARGE HAIRY CREST RUNNING DOWN ITS SPINE
SIX MONTHS AGO IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER
NO ONE DISH REMAINS AVAILABLE FOR VERY LONG
AND THE FOXES ARE ONLY TOO GLAD TO TAKE IT
IF STATISTICS ARE ANYTHING TO GO BY
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT
LEARNED SOME NEW THINGS AS WELL
WHATEVER THE PAY IS
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT
IF THEY WANT TO EMIGRATE
THIS BASICALLY MEANS THAT WE START HOME WITH OUR OLD FRIENDS
TINA AND ROBIN ARE STILL UNDECIDED ABOUT THEIR MOVE DOWN UNDER
LET'S HOPE IT WORKS OUT FOR THEM
BUT FOR SOME MAMMALS
TO HELP WITH BALANCE
IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK OF AS A REAL FOREST THE TROPICAL RAINFOREST
THERE'S A GREATER VARIETY OF FOOD UP HERE THAN THERE IS ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE NATURAL WORLD
THE MOST OBVIOUS SOURCE OF FOOD UP HERE
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER
BUT TO SEE HOW IT DOES IT
IT IS AN EMERGENT
THE VIEW IS STUNNING
NOT JUST ANY OLD MAMMALS PRIMATES
HE LIVED AND HE WORKED IN THE CAPITAL
SHE'S SEEN OTHERS DOING IT AND SHE'S COPYING
THAT ABILITY TO IMITATE
SOMETIMES AFTER YEARS OF SEPARATION
BUT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ARGUMENTS
MANKIND'S ANCESTORS WERE WALKING ON TWO FEET
AND THEY HAVE FOSSILISED BEHAVIOUR AND REVEALED FAMILY LIFE IN A WAY THAT IS
THAT CRUCIAL MOMENT
THE LATEST INSCRIPTION TO BE FOUND IN THE RUINS OF THE CITY CAN BE DATED TO
THE MAYA RECORDED THEIR HISTORY IN GREAT DETAIL ON STONES LIKE THIS
TRYING TO CULTIVATE ANYTHING WOULD SEEM TO BE FUTILE
TWENTY THAT OUR SPECIES MAY LAUNCH ITS MOST AMBITIOUS PROJECT YET TO SETTLE
MOST COMPLEX ACHIEVEMENTS AND HIGHEST HOPES
AND IT'S FROM HERE
WORK ON SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF LIVING ON MARS IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW
BUT I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE
BUT BASED ON THAT I'M GOING TO GO DOWN THE MIDDLE
I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT IT'S PAYPHONE
WHICH IS HEY YA
I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA
I'LL GO FOR RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN
TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND WHICH
WHAT INFORMAL NAME IS GIVEN TO A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF ASSETS USED AS
THOUSAND PO SAYS THEY DON'T
I'M THIRTY TWO AND I' A CALL CENTRE WORKER
FOOTBALL IS A BIT LIKE HOCKEY
WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY FROM THE EGGHEADS
SO I'LL GO FOR TRACE ELEMENT
I SUPPOSE THE FOOD PRESERVATIVE THING COULD BE
I'LL SAY BARBARA WINDSOR
NICOLAS SARKOZY BECAME LEADER OF WHICH POLITICAL PARTY
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE
ALTHOUGH THAT WAS A BIT EARLIER
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
WHICH IS ALWAYS
THOUSAND POUND SAYS THEY DON'T
THEY'VE TAKEN THE IDEA OF LOCAL FOOD TO THE EXTREME AND ARE AIMING TO BECOME A SELF SUSTAINING
THEY'VE PUT FREE HERBS OUTSIDE OF THE RAILWAY STATION BUT
AND I'LL BE FINDING OUT HOW
SO HE CLEARLY HAD A REAL
GROWS INTO A PLANT TALLER THAN ME AND ABOUT THIS WIDE
IN REAL FIELD SITUATION
WE HAD TO COME THROUGH VERY SOON AFTER PLANTING
RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD
THERE WAS THIRTY FORTY
INCLUDING THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE LANDSCAPE
IT'S ALL BASED ON THIS FIFTY EIGHT PAGE REPORT PREPARED FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
AS WE'RE IN A WATERY CLASSROOM
THEY GET LOST ON THE WAY HOME
THEY'RE NOT SO GOOD AT GATHERING FOOD
IT'S SOMETHING THAT BUGLIFE HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR RIGHT FROM THE START
THAT WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO PUT A BAN IN BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT IT
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK INSIDE
FARMERS WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S ON THE SHELVES AND IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING FOR THEM AT THE MOMENT WITH
AND I HOPE WE NEVER SEE THAT AGAIN
YOU'LL WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER HAS IN STORE
HERE'S THE COUNTRY FAR FORECAST
NOW THAT'S A SURPRISE
I'LL BE LOOKING BACK AT SOME OF THE BEST LOVED COUNTRY FILE STORIES INVOLVING RURAL ARCHITECTURE
HE OVERCAME THESE OBSTACLES
THOUSAND NEW SPECIES
AND DARWIN WAS LANDED GENTRY
RUNNING IN FEAR OF THEIR LIVES
HE WROTE TO HIS FRIEND HENRY BATES
BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE
COULDN'T WAIT TO TELL EVERYONE
ON THE OTHER HAND
AND IT'S STILL A FAVOURITE GAME TODAY
IT WAS UTTERLY SURREAL FOR WALLACE
THEY SHOULDN'T BE THERE
SOMETHING WAS VERY STRANGE
YET THRILLING AT THE SAME TIME
IT SEEMED TO DEFY ALL HIS ASSUMPTIONS
IT PROVOKED WALLACE TO ASK DEEPER
MORE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS
MY NAME'S ANTHONY
FILMS NOT AS MUCH BUT
THIS WAS THE ONE STARRING THE TWO FAMILIES
NONE OF THOSE TEMPERATURES MEAN ANYTHING TO ME
I'M GOING TO SAY NINE SIX
THERE ARE OTHERS
HE'S WON FIVE OLYMPIC GOLDS
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND WHICH
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
SO I GUESS IT'S A HORSE
SO THAT WOULD BE MY ANSWER
I'M TWENTY FOUR AND I'M A CREDIT CONTROL TEAM LEADER
I'M TWENTY SEVEN AND I'M ALSO A CREDIT CONTROL TEAM LEADER
WELCOME TO EHEADS
I THOUGHT IT WAS ST PAUL'S CATHEDRAL
HELD IN RIO DE JANEIRO
I WILL TAKE BARRY ON MUSIC
I DON'T THINK IT'S DANNY BY
IF YOU LOSE THIS ONE
I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST
LOOK IF YOU IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT
SO WITH THAT IN MIND
THOUSAND POUNDS SAYS THEY DON'T
I'M THIRTY TWO AND I'M A REGIONAL DIRECTOR
SOMETHING TO DO WITH CAVALRY
HAVING PREVIOUSLY BORNE EIGHT CHILDREN TO HER FIRST HUSBAND
AND I'M I'M SURE HE WAS PLAYING ALREADY IN EIGHTY NINE
I LOVE THE WAY YOU SHARE YOUR INTERNAL DIALOGUE WITH US
FLAVOUR AND TRADITION
I'M NOT RAKING BACK INTO MY MEMORIES FROM MY CHILDHOOD
AND IT WORKS AND IT'S BRILLIANT
AND WE DON'T CARE IF WE GET IT WRONG
WITH CABBAGE LEAVES
IT WAS THE THERMAL QUALITY OF CABBAGE ON THE MOTORARBIKE
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE
I'M FORTY EIGHT AND I'M THE EVENTS COORDINATOR
I'M THE CANON MISSIONER
I'LL GO FOR THE THE LONGEST TRADITION
AND THEN I WAS GIVEN THE THE HONOUR OF HANDING IT TO THE INJURED SOLDIER IN
SO THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND WHICH
IT'S ROD STEWART
THOUSAND BAND SAYS THEY DON'T
WELCOME TO E HEAD THE SHOW AND A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE
MY NAME IS BARBARA
I'M SIXTY TWO AND I'M A COMPANY DIRECTOR
MY NAME IS RICHARD
I'M FIFTY EIGHT I'M AN EQUIPMENT RESOURCES MANAGER
WRITING AND DIRECTING
I'LL GO FOR CHINA
IT'S THE CENTRAL ONE IN BRUSSELS
I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM
BUT TIM BURTON HAS ALWAYS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HELENA BONHAM CARTER
I THINK YOU CAN RULE NATO OUT
WHERE IT LOOKED LIKE LABOUR WAS WINNING IN THE OPINION POLLS
AND THEN I THINK THE SUN PUT SOMETHING ABOUT TURNING THE LIGHTS OUT
INFLUENTIAL AS A
THOUSAND PAN NOW SAYS THEY DON'T
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE MARKET'S DOING
WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT AND I'VE NEVER HAD ENOUGH TIME
UM THEY'VE PUT SOME OF THEIR SAVINGS INTO IT
COME ON MAJOR MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED
I'M THINKING TWELVE
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET ON
HAVING BATHROOMS DOWNSTAIRS CAN BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT
DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF THE REFURB
THE OUTSIDE BATHROOM IS A REAL NO NO AND ALTHOUGH YOU'LL LOSE A BEDROOM
SO WHO WAS READY TO TAKE ON THIS CAMBERWELL COTTAGE
AND I CAN BE MY OWN CLIENT
AND THE KITCHEN
VALUATION OF SIXTY NINE
VERY CLEAN AND FRESH
FIRST AND FOREMOST
I THINK IT'S BUYER BEWARE ON THIS
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IT ENDED UP COSTING MORE
THEY GAVE US THREE OPTIONS ONE WHICH WAS TO REBUILD IT
I SUGGEST THE TOP VALUATION COULD BE IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY
I'D UP THAT VALUATION TO SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE
SO HE OBVIOUSLY DID FLEE IN A BIT OF A HURRY
THE LOCALS WERE BATTENING DOWN THE HATCHES ON A FORTRESS OF A DIFFERENT KIND
IN A PLACE CALLED TARSET
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
YEAH THE WHOLE RANGE OF FAMILY NAMES STILL AROUND HERE
AND I'M STARTING MY JOURNEY HERE IN THE NORTHUMBERLAND NATIONAL PARK
I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE I GO
WHAT ARE THEY LAUGHING ABOUT
AND I FINALLY ASKED THE GUY
WHAT'S SO FUNNY WHEN THEY'RE COMING DOWN THE STAIRCASE
AND AS IT HAPPENS
I LIKE TO SLEEP WITH MY PAINTINGS
YOU REALISE THAT
AM NOT ON MAINS WATER HERE
AND I REALISED THAT IF I DIDN'T DO IT THEN
AND ONLY A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER
AND IT'S AIMED AT THE MASS MARKET
BUT THAT SOLD ZERO COPIES
BUT THE POPE AT THE TIME SAID NO
I HOPE WE DON'T HAVE A SUMMER LIKE LAST SUMMER
SO WHILE I DO ALL THIS LAST MINUTE CRAMMING
THAT'S IT FOR THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF COUNTRYFI AND
THE HOME OF RACING
AND JOHN WILL BE FINDING OUT ABOUT JOHN CLARE
ENGLAND'S FIRST GREEN POET
I THOUGHT YOU DID A REALLY FANTASTIC JOB
EVERYBODY AROUND ME
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY
I CAN REALLY SEE WHY
THE PILES OF CONTAINERS GO ON FOR KILOMETRES
AND WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK
WHILE WOMEN BELLOW ANCIENT HYMNS AND THE CROWD SHOUTS
HAVING THEIR SECRET MEETING
FOR MANY IT'S BEEN WHEN THEY'VE TOUCHED OBJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH GREAT MOMENTS IN HISTORY
A VERY BIG SALE
SO EVERY FACT I CAME OUT WITH
AND IT WAS ALWAYS MY BALL THAT ENDED UP IN THE NET IT
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT HE WAS WRONG
OTHERWISE ACTUALLY WHAT WAS I DOING THERE
AND FOR ANYBODY LISTENING
AND HE COULD SAY THAT HE COULD HOLD IN HIS HAND AN OBJECT WHICH HIS ANCESTOR
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE GETTING A TASTE FORTIS WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG
AND THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE FOR MANY OF OUR EXPERTS
WHO LEARNED THEIR TRADE BY STARTING RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LADDER
SO WE TOOK ONE OF OUR BEST LOVED SPECIALISTS
MY THANKS TO OUR TEAM OF EXPERTS FOR BRINGING BACK SUCH GREAT MEMORIES AND WE'VE ONE FINAL QUESTION
AFTER GETTING ON FOR FIVE HUNDRED ROADSHOWS WHAT IS IT THEY LOVE ABOUT THE SHOW
AS THE EXPERTS DIDN'T ON THE RECORDING DAY
ONE IS DESERT ISLAND DISCS AND THE OTHER IS THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW
I STOOD A PROGRAMME THAT NO ONE ENVISAGED WOULD GO ON FOREVER
IT'S QUITE INCREDIBLE
I'M STOOD HERE AND I'VE GOT ME CUE AND THAT'S ALL I NEED
GOT HIM NICELY DRESSED
THE MORE FAMOUS YOU BECOME
IF IT MEANT THAT HIM TAKING A CHANCE OR TAKING A RISK
YEAH AND HE WEREN'T FIGHTING JOE FRAZIER
THAT'S WHAT MADE IT SO EXCITING
I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M PLAYING SO WELL
I KNOCKED A BEER ALL OVER ME
I FELT LIKE IT WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON
HE LOST EVERY SINGLE TIME
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
AND THE DEMON INSIDE HIM
THE JEKYLL AND HYDE CHARACTER THAT WAS ALEX HIGGINS WHEN HE WAS FUELLED BY ALCOHOL
WAS THE BIGGEST PAIN YOU'VE EVER MET
ONCE AH HE'D HAD A FEW BATTERING FROM DAVIS
WE'RE FIGHTING BACK THE MOMENT
SOMETHING TRIGGERED SOMETHING IN ALEX
HAVE ONE OF THOSE
ANYTHING AFTERWARDS
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM
AND BECAUSE HE COULDN'T ENTERTAIN
BUT YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE THINGS SOMETIMES WITH A PINCH OF SALT THAT ALEX USED TO SAY BUT
THERE'S NO RIGHT TO APPEAL
WE HAD AN ARGUMENT LAST YEAR
IT'S WHEN YOU'VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE IN AH IN A VULNERABLE SITUATION
LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
THE BAD NEWS IS THE VALUE'S JUST GONE DOWN
THINGS ARE CLOSE TODAY
WHICH MAKES A TOTAL
WITH THE TWO LOTS
I THINK A VENUE LIKE THIS CAN PROVIDE A REAL FOCAL POINT
JOHN WEBBER AND A GROUP OF LIKE MINDED PEOPLE BASICALLY FORMED A REGISTERED CHARITY WITH THE AIM OF
IS THAT A POLICY THAT YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN
WE CERTAINLY TRY TO KEEP A FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE AND TO GIVE PEOPLE A WARM WELCOME
PEOPLE HAVE THIS FEELING THAT THEY'RE SLIGHTLY IMPERSONAL PLACES
AND AND IT'S A TRIP INTO NOSTALGIA AS WELL
SO WE'RE NEARLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD
THE EMBOSSED METAL PANELS ARE A BIG PART OF THE REASON WHY WE GAINED LISTED BUILDING
HOW DOES THE FILM ARRIVE
IT WAS REALLY A PERFECTLY SENSIBLE ECONOMIC DECISION
NINETY THREE OR SOMETHING
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
IT WAS BASICALLY THE FACT YOU COULD WALK ON WATER
THIS WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
THREE YEARS LATER
BUT IT WAS A REAL
I'VE COME TO TALK TO A CHAP CALLED MIKE DAVIES
PROGRAMME WAS BEING FILMED
IT'S VERY DESIRABLE
I SEE THIS MAKING FIVE HUNDRED
WATCH THIS WATCH FLY
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY
IT WAS LEFT TO HIS WIFE
AND NOW WE'VE JUST GOT TO FIND OUT WHETHER YOU'LL GET THE THIRTY OR THE FIFTY
AS WE APPROACH THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH
AS MORE OF US FLOCK TO THE COUNTRYSIDE
JUST A FEW DAYS OLD
AND WHAT BABY LAMBS NEED IS LOTS OF MILK
WEVE GOT EVERY GRASS GALLOP YOU CAN IMAGINE
DOING WHAT WE DO
AH WHILE WE'RE EXPLORING CAMBRIDGE
EVERY BIT OF NATURE
EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY
WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM
BUT ALSO THAT DEDICATED TO THIS ALMOST CREEPILY LEVEL OF METHODICAL DETAIL OF WHICH HE
BUT IT'S THAT DETAIL AND IT'S THAT DEDICATION THAT MEANS THAT INFORMATION IS SO USEFUL AND SO
AND A MAN WE'VE ALL HEARD OF
AND THE OTHER ONE IS A HOUSEHOLD NAME
AND I'M HERE TO FIND OUT WHY
A GENTLEMAN CALLED JOHN GULLY
IT WOULD BE TRICKY
BUT I DO THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO BE MORE AWARE OF PEOPLE WALKING
WE LAMB THE MAJORITY OF OUR FLOCK INDOORS
BUT BEFORE I TAKE MY SHEEP OVER THERE
AND I'M HERE TODAY TO WATCH AND TO LISTEN TO A REMARKABLE EXPERIMENT INVOLVING ITS
THE SEVEN DAYS OF THE WEEK
THE CATHEDRAL HAS DOMINATED THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE
BUT IT'S AN INTERESTING THEORY BUT
THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON WHY THE CHORISTERS HAVE JUST BEEN SINGING ABOUT HEDGEHOGS
IF YOU FIND IT AT NIGHT
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM
THAT SHOULD BE A NORMAL
THEY'RE UP SUPER EARLY
WILL BE IN HAMPSHIRE WHERE MATT WILL BE TAKING A TRIP ALONG THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED SHIPWRIGHTS WAY
AND IT CAN BE TOUGH AND THEY DO GET HOMESICK
AND WE OFTEN GET A LOT OF TEARS IN THOSE FIRST FEW WEEKS
WHERE THEY'RE MISSING HOME AND THEY'RE FINDING IT HARD
FRIENDS FOR LIFE
AND JUST DOING MY HORSES ON THE SIDE
JOHN BLY AND CHRISTOPHER PAYNE WILL BE FINDING OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S INVOLVED AS THEY TRY TO LEARN THE TRICKS OF THE
SHOULD I UNPACK IT
IMMEDIATELY YOU GO BACK TO WHEN YOU FIRST HEARD
OR SIGNED BY THEIR IDOL
TO CATCH THE MAN
THIS RING WAS WORN BY JIMI HENDRIX AND NOT ONLY THAT
SEVERAL OF SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES PUT IT ON AS WELL BECAUSE YOU KNOW PUTTING ON AN OBJECT LIKE THAT
AND SO IT WAS PARTICULARLY EVOCATIVE TO ME AND I REMEMBER THAT MEETING VERY WELL
SHOULD YOU ARE A CRADLE TO GRAVER
UM THAT MIXED IN WITH FAIRLY PRECOCIOUS CHILD WHO LIKED GOING ON STAGE AND
A DAY HE REMEMBERS WELL
THE PHONE'S GOING
YOU'RE ON YEAH
WE FORGET ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT
AND WHAT A GREAT DAY
EVERY NOW AND THEN
IT WAS ABOUT COMMUNISTS
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THE TEMPERATURE UP TO THIRTY
JOIN US TOMORROW
WE TURN THE CLOCK BACK TO OUR VISIT TO MOUNT STEWART IN NORTHERN IRELAND
WHEN WE TRY TO ANSWER THE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE QUESTION OF WHAT'S BEEN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ITEM EVER
SO WE'RE GOING TO BRING YOU THE STRANGEST STORIES OUR WORLD HAS TO OFFER
WITH THE HELP OF SCIENTISTS
THE NUMBER THIRTEEN MUST BE PRETTY IMPORTANT
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES
WHETHER YOU LOVE OR LOATHE CICADAS
WE'RE NOT EXEMPT FROM THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOUR RIGHT HERE IN THE UK
BELIEVE IT OR NOT
JUST A FEW MILLIMETRES ACROSS
IN THE END THOUGH
IT'S THE ANTS' KEY STRENGTH THEIR ABILITY TO ACT AS ONE
THE WIND PICKS UP AGAIN
I ALSO HAD A FASCINATION WITH THOSE ATOMIC BOMB CLOUDS
ALTHOUGH I MUST CONFESS
TAKE THE AVERAGE FLUFFY CUMULUS CLOUD
USING THE VOLUME
THE AIR DENSITY AND THE CONCENTRATION OF WATER DROPLETS
THAT'S THE SAME AS TWO HUNDRED
THOUSAND AFRICAN BULL ELEPHANTS OR SIX THOUSAND
SO WHETHER WE'RE JUST TRYING TO LIVE ALONGSIDE IT
SIX HUNDRED YACHTS TAKING PART
AND THE DECISION IS GOING TO BE DOWN TO EACH INDIVIDUAL SKIPPER TO GET THAT RIGHT
WHAT WAS GOING ON TO THE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE
ALL HIS MEN WAITING FOR HIS ORDERS
YEAH BUT IT WASN'T EXACTLY THAT SAFE
THE BOW WAVE PUSHES THE MINE OUT OF THE WAY
THE SKILLS THAT THEY NEED
THE WAY OF DRIVING A BOAT IS EXACTLY THE SAME
BECAUSE I DIDN'TLA THERE WERE SO MANY
MOST OF THE PEOPLE HAVE GONE SHALLOW
SHORTLY AFTER THE VERDICT
WHEN IT GOES ON
FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT AND THINGS LIKE THAT
MAYBE BE TRAVELLING IN ASIA OR TRAVELLING IN AMERICA
I CAN NEVER REALLY TELL
IF THAT BECOMES UNBEARABLE
BECAUSE THE PUBLIC WANT US TO BE ABLE TO CARRY ON INVESTING AND IT'S TOP OF THEIR
DID ANYTHING REALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THIS SUDDENLY HAPPENING
THAT'S A CHALLENGE
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
WELCOME TO DECADES
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
I'M SIXTY THREE AND I'M A MASTERPOINT ADMINISTRATOR
AND THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED GRAND MASTERS
SO I THINK THE ANSWER TO THIS ONE IS POVERTY
THAT BEGIN WITH THE SAME LETTER
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
IT'S THE LARGEST CITY AND
WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS ONE
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE MILL WHEEL RUNNING AGAIN
AND AND THEY THEY CONSTANTLY ASK THAT
BUT THAT'S THAT'S ON THE UNDERSIDE
TO DO EVERYTHING WE WANT TO DO
WHEN THIS TURNS AGAIN
THE MILL COMES TO LIFE
THE LAST MILLER WHO WORKED THERE
IT WAS A COMMUNITY THAT HAD BEEN THERE FOR CENTURIES
PUSHING THE EDUCATION SIDE OF IT WHERE I DO WANT TO HAVE SCHOOL VISITS AND I DO WANT TO DO QUITE A
THEY WERE EXTREMELY EFFICIENT BECAUSE THEY USED GRAVITY AS WELL AS THE MOMENTUM OF THE WATER
WHICH IN THE WILD NEST IN HOLES IN TREES
THEY NEST OUT IN THE OPEN
THERE'S NO CENTRAL CONTROLLING INTELLIGENCE AS SUCH
LOTS OF ANIMALS AMPHIBIANS
AND IT'S GOT THE HELI GIMBLE ATTACHED TO IT AS WELL
THERE'S A PLACE IN THE SEMIFIN AT STAKE
SO THE JUDGES AREN'T GOING TO MAKE IT EASY
TWO DAYS OF PRECISION SEWING LIE AHEAD
SO I'M WASTING TIME
SO FOR THAT REASON
BUT NOW IT'S ONTO CHALLENGE TWO
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A HOW TO GUIDE
WHICH SEEMS RATHER APPROPRIATE
YEAH JUST USING THE POINT
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
I'M SIXTY AND I'M A SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPIST
EVERYDAY THERE'S ONE
I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE ROLLING STONES
MY WIFE ABSOLUTELY ADORES CELEBRITY SHOWS
AND I HAD TO SIT THROUGH COUNTLESS VERSIONS OF THE SEARCH FOR THE NEXT NANCY
AND THIS SONG SEEMED TO COME UP EVERY TIME
MICHAEL JOHNSON HAS A VERY UPRIGHT RUNNING STYLE
I BELIEVE HE DRANK VERY HEAVILY
THIS IS OUR LAST HEAD TO HEAD BEFORE THE FINAL ROUND
WHICH STAND UP TO TWO METRES TALL AT THE SHOULDER AND CAN WEIGH OVER ONE THOUSAND
AND I JUST CANNOT
NOTHING IS REALLY LEAPING OUT AT ME
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
I'LL ASK EACH TEAM THREE QUESTIONS IN TURN
I THINK OLIVIA NEWTON JOHN IS MISSING A BIT OF A TRICK
JOIN US NEXT TIME TO SEE IF A NEW TEAM OF CHALLENGERS HAVE THE BRAINS TO DEFEAT THE EGGHEADS
THOUSAND POUND SAYS THEY DON'T
UNDER THE MARINE POLLUTION CONVENTION
A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SUBSTANCES ARE BANNED
HE SHOT HIS MISTRESS'S HUSBAND
THE COUNT OF SHREWSBURY
PAID OVER A MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE HOUSE AND THE ESTATE
GEORGE BERON SHAW
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE WORLD AND HIS VERY FAMOUS RICH WIFE OR MISTRESS CAME HERE
AND IT ALL STARTED HERE BY THE POOL
SORT COME BACK EVERY DAY AND YOU SORT OF
THERE IS STILL NOT ONE PROTECTED AREA FOR SEABIRDS AT SEA
FOR THEIR FEEDING AREAS OUT AT SEA
UK WIDE ANNUAL SURVEY TO TRY TO PAINT A PICTURE OF JUST HOW FIT OR UNFIT
YOU HELPED ME NAME ERIC'S FIRST CROP OF CALVES
WE HAD TO USE THE LETTER M
EVEN THOUGH HE'S YOUNGER
WANDERING THROUGH A FOREST
AS I AM MAKING A BIT OF A HABIT OF TALKING TO MULTIPLE OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST
THAT'S IT FROM THE THAMES VALLEY
WE'VE DEFINITELY SEEN IT AT ITS VERY BEST
NEXT WEEK WE'RE ON THE HUMBER
IT REALLY IS A QUEST
I GUESS IT'S CAMELS ONE
THEIR SUPREME LONG DISTANCE TRAVELLERS
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
HOME TO WRITE POETRY
WHICH IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY
IF THE VASES MAKE THREE HUNDRED POUNDS
FAMED FOR BEING HOME OF THE ROYAL WELSH SHOW
SO THAT WAS A NICE SURPRISE
BUT HOWEVER YOU FEEL
AND THEY WANTED TO CAPTURE THE BEAUTY OF THE PLACE IN A PAINTING
AND HE LIKED TO PLASTER THE PAINT ON
ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY WORKED OUT BY LOWRY
AND I WAS AWAY FOR SEVEN MONTHS
SO WHEN I EVENTUALLY WAS FREED
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS
BUT IN CASE ALL ELSE FAILS
I AREN'T BOTHERED
WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR CONTESTANTS
ALL OF WHOM WANT TO STITCH THEIR WAY TO VICTORY AND BE CROWNED BRITAIN'S BEST AMATEUR SEWER
THEY GET A CROWN
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE ALTERATION CHALLENGE
DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR
BED TROUSERS WERE OXFORD BAGS
EVERYBODY AROUND ME
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY
WHERE THERE'S NO LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET CRAMMED WITH ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES
WHICH MEANS OUR TEAMS TODAY ARE GOING TO BE RUSHED OFF THEIR FEET FINDING THE MOST PROFITABLE
IT'S A NICE THING
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF TWENTY FOUR YEARS' STANDING
IT'S YOUR LAST CHANCE
ITS TIME TO STOP SHOPPING
WHAT DID HE BUY
FOR THE AUDIENCE
YOU ARE PLUS NINETY
WE MET WHEN I WAS ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD AND I WENT DOWN TO GILLIAN'S BIRTHDAY PARTY WHEN SHE WAS NINE
THAT COULD BE A DUMMY
HE WAS QUITE YOUNGMAN
YOU OWN THIS PLACE
FIVE ONE TEN I'M LOOKING FOR
ARE YOU RELIEVED
POUND I'M ASKING FOR THAT
THE BIGGEST WAS THE WEAKEST
THIS FLANNEL IS SIX YEARS OLD
EVERYBODY'S USED TO HAVING A WASHING MACHINE
THAT IS A DESIGN CLASSIC
IT WAS MADE IN ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE
YOU NEED A STOCKING FILLER
HE IS MASSIVELY IN THE LEAD
COULD YOU DO IT FOR THIRTY
WHAT AN AMAZING BUY
HE REALLY IS PLAYING THE GAME AND HE HAS TO BE ADMIRED FOR THAT
I WILL GIVE YOU FIFTY
I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE
ESPECIALLY IN A FIELD KITCHEN
BACK IN THE YEAR
IT COULD BE A JUG WORTH MAYBE EIGHT HUNDRED PO
IT MIGHT MAKE MORE THAN A HUNDRED POUNDS
I'M REALLY EXCITED
THAT IN THE AUCTION ROOM IS JUST A MAGNET
IF IT'S IN THE CABINET
LOTS OF GOODIES IN IT
I PREDICT THAT WILL MAKE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
ALL I FOR TWENTY TWO AND I SELL
WHEN I WAS IN MY TWENTY S
PRETTY MUCH IN THIS SPOT
SO THAT'S HOW YOU SUCCEEDED AT SCHOOL
PLEASE DO IT THROUGH ME
I'M GOING TO BE UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF ANOTHER DRIVER
BUT IF WE HAD IT
LET ME JUST SAY
BECAUSE YOU CAN HARDLY HEAR OVER THE FAN
AND THE TRAFFIC
AND NOT ONLY IS IT ENORMOUS
AND THEN ALONG COMES THIS INVITATION FROM THE BRITISH EMPIRE EXHIBITION TO PUT ON A BIG DISPLAY
BUT IT'S GOT THE NAME ON THE SIDE
AH FOR THE FIRST TIME
LOCOMOTIVES WITH THE POWER AND THE STAMINA TO RUN ALL THE WAY NONSTOP FROM LONDON TO EDINBURGH
AND THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT QUICKLY REALISED THIS AND DECIDED THEY WANTED TO MAKE USE OF THAT
AND ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS DISCOVERS HIM SORT OF SQUEEZING ALONG BECAUSE HE'S QUITE A BIG BLOKE SQUEEZING
AND ON MAY THE FIRST
THERE'S OVER TWO HUNDRED SIGNAL BOXES EN ROUTE
AS ONE OF HIS FRIENDS DESCRIBED HIM
AND BY THE TIME THAT EL WERE COMMISSIONING GILL
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE TYPE LOOKS LIKE
CURLY OR STRAIGHT
THE FLYING SCOTSMAN
I'D LIKE TO BE ON BOARD THAT TRAIN
FLYING SCOTSMAN RINGS A BELL
I'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT
NOBODY HAD EVER DONE IT BEFORE
IT WOULD BE LIKE GOING TO BRITISH AIRWAYS TODAY AND ASKING TO BUY A JUMBO JET OFF THEM
WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS OF HIS OWNERSHIP OF IT
WELL IT'S THE END OF THESE OLD TIMERS AND THE NEW WORLD HAS TO COME
PRETTY POLLLY TIGHTS
THE BUSINESSES HAD ALL TAKEN BIG ORDERS AND
THAT WAS WHAT HE'D DONE
HE'D LIVED HIS PASSION
IF THERE IS A PROBLEM
IS THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH OLD MACHINES AND WITH
UNTIL YOU TAKE THE BOILER OFF
UNTIL YOU STRIP EVERYTHING DOWN TO ITS COMPONENTS
YOU SIMPLY CAN'T TELL WHAT CONDITION THEY'RE IN AND
WITH THE BOILER IN PARTICULAR
YOU HAVE THIS WONDERFUL NAME WHICH
EPITOMISES THE STEAM AGE IN A WAY THAT NOTHING ELSE EVER
THE FIRST STEAM LOCOMOTIVE
LORD SEFTON WAS APPALLED AT THE IDEA OF BEING FORCED TO ALLOW THE HOI POLLOI TO CROSS
IT WAS A DANGEROUS ASSAULT ON THE PRIVILEGED CLASS
HE HAD NO CHOICE
THIS BOG USED BE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE SQUARE KILOMETRES
IT WAS A MASSIVE
WORKING LIKE BEASTS
AND IF YOU TREAT PEOPLE LIKE ANIMALS
THEY'LL BECOME ONE
AND FOUR DAYS LATER
SO WHEN THE TRAIN CAME TO A STOP
WE STARTED WITH EIGHT SEWERS
WE INTRODUCE OUR SEWERS TO THEIR MODELS WHO THEY'VE WORKED WITH FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS
BUT BECAUSE IT'S THE FINAL
REALLY BEAUTIFUL WORK AND EVERY TIME WE'VE GIVEN HER A CHALLENGE
MY BRADSHAW'S GUIDE HAS HELPED ME TO UNDERSTAND THE ENGINEERING
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHANGES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
HERE WE ARE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE
I HAVE A FEELING THAT I WILL UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW ALL THIS WORKS IF WE WERE TO TAKE TO THE WATER
WHICH IS HELD IN OCTOBER
WONDERFUL INDIVIDUAL OF HIS TIME
BUT IT CAUGHT THE IMAGINATION OF THE NATION
A PORT IN THE WEST OF IRELAND
WHEN THE RAILWAY STATION WASD HERE IN AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE
AND THAT TREND HAS BEEN REINFORCED RECENTLY
FESTIVALS AND YACHT RACES
THEIR MARKET BEING CLOSE TO AN OLD TOWER AND GATE
IF YOU ASKED THEM WHERE THEY CAME FROM
NEVER GOING OUT TO FISH NOR ALLOWING OTHERS TO GO OUT EXCEPT ON LUCKY DAYS
TODAY MUST BE AN AUSPICIOUS DAY
BECAUSE THAT COULD CAUSE FAULTS AND PROBLEMS
SPACE IS GOING COMMERCIAL
ENGINEERING IS GREAT
AND THAT'S EXCITING ON ANY LEVEL
BUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S AN INTERNATIONAL RACE TO BE THE FIRST TO PROVIDE SPACE TOURISM
FLY INTO SPACE AND RETURN IN ONE PIECE
IN THE EARLY PART OF THE TRAJECTORY
ALL THAT KINETIC ENERGY
IS THEN AT THAT POINT TRANSFORMED INTO PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE
ROCKET SCIENTIST I THINK THAT'S REALLY COOL
WE ARE FASCINATED BY THE RESTAURANTS
ONCE I'VE PUT THAT GENE IN
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM
WOULD YOU SAY GO DOWN THE CREATIVE PATH
OR GO DOWN THE SCIENCE PATH
IT'S A COMPETITIVE BUSINESS THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO STAY STILL
AND I HEAR THEY DON'T JUST WEAR A LAB COAT
BUT NOW I'VE GOT TO TEST THAT IT WORKS
BUT WHAT I WAS QUICK AT WAS UNDERSTANDING THINGS AND SEEING THINGS IN MORE OF A PICTORIAL SENSE
BECAUSE IT'S LIVE AND LIVING
BUT WHEN WE PROJECT SOMETHING AT THE BACK THROUGH A MONITOR
THAT IS WHAT THE FUTURE WILL BE
IT'S A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS SOLVING
BY USING AN IMPLANT OF THIS TYPE
COULD WE DO THIS
IT'S COMPOSED MAINLY OF QUICKSAND THEY HAD TERRIBLE PROBLEMS WITH FLOODING
NO WONDER THAT AFTER IT WAS BUILT
THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA
THE ROMAN ROAD NETWORK
IT'S MILES AWAY
YOU CAN'T SEE IT
INTO WHICH HE'D INVESTED TEN
YOU WOULD SELL LARGE NUMBERS OF THEM
TO ATTEND A TEMPERANCE CONFERENCE
YOU ARE RUSHING TO DESTRUCTION IN CONSEQUENCE OF YOUR BLINDNESS
THAT WOULD NEVER GET BUILT
DEPRIVED ALMOST OF THEIR DAILY BREAD
WAS FOUND DEAD IN HYDE PARK HAVING SHOT HIMSELF
AS THE TIMES NEWSPAPER WROTE
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE TRACKS STILL SURVIVE AND FORM THE BACKBONE OF OUR MODERN RAIL NETWORK
IF WE INCLUDE MY GRANDSON
HIS SKULL HAD BEEN SMASHED IN AND HE WAS MUMBLING AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH
THE DEVOUR OF OF HIERARCHIES
THE PACE OF CHANGE WAS SO FAST
WHAT'S THE PRICE THAT'S GOT TO BE PAID FOR ALL OF THIS PROGRESS
FILLED WITH AN EVANGELICAL ZEAL
ONE MORE DISASTROUS INVESTMENT BACK HERE IN THE UK
THE LONDON CHATHAM DOVER LINE
SEVEN HOURS AND HALF IN THREE
BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE A LITTLE KID AGAIN
THEY CLAMBERED ABOARD SPECIALLY MODIFIED LANCASTER BOMBERS
TAXIED OUT TO THE RUNWAY AND TOOK OFF
BUT THEY LACKED THE TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER A PRECISION STRIKE AGAINST THEM
ALTHOUGH SOME WERE MARRIED
BUT HE WAS ONLY TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD
BUT BY THE STANDARDS OF THE PEOPLE HE FLEW WITH
AS THEY PREPARED TO TAKE OFF INTO THE GATHERING DUSK
YOU'VE TRAVELLED TWELVE
OF COURSE I WAS EXCITED
IT WAS A HIGHLIGHT
I'M SO IMPRESSED
I THINK IT'S WORTH IT
EVERY MINUTE OF IT
BEING JOSTLED AROUND INSIDE
I HAPPEN TO HAVE HIS LOGBOOK
WHICH WAS HANDED TO MY MOTHER BY HARRY HUMPHRIES
WE THINK THE LANCASTER IS ON ITS WAY
YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING THE SAME JOB
PRECISION STRIKE IS WHAT THE DAMBUES ARE ABOUT IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE AND THAT'S VERY MUCH THE SAME TODAY
AND ALSO SQUADRON LEADER MARK JACKSON
WHICH WERE POINTED TOWARDS EACH OTHER
AND THEY CREATED A FIGURE EIGHT ON THE GROUND
WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO KNOW THEY WERE SIXTY FEET ABOVE ABOVE THE DAMS
AND THEN YOU THINK ABOUT TODAY
WITH THE SORT OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE
SORT OF STORM SHADOW MISSILES AND THE SORT OF PRECISION STRIKE THAT WE HAVE
UNDER A FULL MOON
THE MAGNIFICENT DAMBUSTERS OF SIX HUNDRED SEVEN SQUADRON
AND THE DEDICATION
THE PRINCE OF PEACE
WHO DIED THAT ALL MIGHT BE FREE
HENRY HAD ALREADY CHANGED THE COURSE OF ENGLISH HISTORY
WITH THE FALLOUT FROM A STRING OF FAILED MARRIAGES
AND A RELIGIOUS REVOLUTION
WHEN HENRY KNELT TO MAKE HIS WEDDING VOWS TO ANNE BOLEYN IN JANUARY FIFTEEN THIRTY THREE
HE KNEW HE WAS HEADED FOR TROUBLE
AND IN TANDEM THE EUROPEAN CATHOLIC NATIONS
SCULPTURE AND PAINTINGS
NO LONGER WOULD HENRY NEED THE POPE OR EVEN THE SAINTS THAT THE POPE HAD RATIFIED
LESS STILL THE CARDINALS WHO REPRESENTED HIM
BETWEEN THOMAS CROMWELL
REALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME
IT SAYS VOLUMES THAT A MAN LIKE CROMWELL
WHO ESSENTIALLY RAN THE COUNTRY
HAD TIME TO CULTIVATE DRAMA
WITH ONE VOICE AGREEABLE
BUT I'M ONLY TAKING THEM BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO
OVER TWO HUNDRED OF THEM
MAINTAINING BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS
THE RULERS OF SPAIN AND FRANCE HAVE MADE PEACE SENSATIONALLY
FOR ABOUT THE FIRST TIME IN GENERATIONS
THE MONASTERIES ARE HOUSES OF GOD AND THE ART HEREERS DIRECT PEOPLE'S ATTENTION TO GOD
THAT'S IN THE BIBLE
TO THE FAKE GOD
WHO'S IN MATERIAL THINGS
THEN WE'D PROBABLY STILL HAVE MONASTERIES IN SOME FORM TODAY
HENRY'S REFORMATION IS NOT PROTESTANT
IT'S OFFICIALLY FOR A NEW
AND THE BIBLE DEFINITELY COMES DOWN HARD ON THAT
AND YOU KEEP THE OTHER IMAGES
NOT AS SACRED THINGS THEMSELVES
BUT A LOT OF THEM WERE UPSET ABOUT IT
A LOT OF THEM ARE CONNECTED TO FOREIGN ORDERS ABROAD
BURNED THE FURNITURE INSIDE THEM
AND THE PAINTED AND GRAVEN IMAGE WHICH SUPPORTED THEIR BELIEFS
THIS WAS ENOUGH TO CAUSE AN UPRISING LED BY ONE ROBERT ASKE
A LONDON BARRISTER
BUT HE DIDN'T KEEP TO HIS WORD
UM HE'S LOST HIS TWO PREVIOUS WIVES
CATHERINE OF ARAGON HAS DIED
SO WHILE THE MURAL WAS ONLY SEEN BY A FEW PEOPLE THOSE PEOPLE WERE VERY INFLUENTIAL
UM AND MANY OF THE EARLY COPIES SEEM TO ORIGINATE WITH ARTISTS AROUND HOLBEIN
PORTRAITS TENDED TO BE HEAD AND SHOULDERS YOU COULD CHOOSE WHICH WAY YOU LOOKED TO GET YOUR BEST
IT'S A MUCH HARDER GAME TO PAINT SOMEONE FULL HEIGHT
IT'S IN YOUR FACE
IN OCTOBER FIFTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
JANE SEYMOUR GAVE HIM A SON
GIVEN HENRY'S NOTORIOUS TRACK RECORD FOR MISTREATING FAMILY MEMBERS
IT WAS PRINCE EDWARD
HENRY WAS OVERJOYED
WE'RE USING THE LATEST DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY TO MEASURE
WHEN HE COMMISSIONS THESE
HENRY IS A NEW FATHER
HE BLUSHED A LITTLE AND LAUGHED
BUT BEYOND THE LADISH JOKES THERE HAD TO BE A SOLUTION
AT SIXTEEN CHRISTINA WAS ALREADY A WIDOW
THAT STUCCO WAS IN HIGH RELIEF
WELCOME TO A
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
I'M FIFTY SIX AND I'M A BUILDER
I'M TWENTY SIX AND I'M A MUSICIAN
AND IT'S MY BROTHER
THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF IS SIMPLE MINDS
DO YOU BY ANY CHANCE KNOW
THE FAMILY OF RATS
SO THEY COULD HAVE CRAWLED UP
A FEW MORE COULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED
SIXTH CENTURY FOR GALEN
SO THAT WOULD PUT HIM IN THE SECOND
SO I'M SAY GEORGE'S MARVELLOUS MEDICINE
THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT CAME TO MIND
WAS WHICH AMERICAN AUTHOR'S SECOND NOVEL
GO WITH THE FAVOURITE
SO THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
WHICH IS JEREMY RENNER
MY ANSWER IS NICOBAR
WE'RE INCLINED TO SAY IT WAS AN AMERICANER
IS TYPICALLY DESCRIBED AS HAVING WHAT OVERALL SHAPE
I'M NOT REALLY INSPIRED
THAT WAS EXCLUSIVELY THE PRESERVE OF THE VICTORIAN SCIENTIFIC ELITE
HE OVERCAME THESE OBSTACLES
ROBERT CHAMBERS WAS THE AUTHOR ON THIS EDITION
IT WAS UTTERLY SURREAL FOR WALLACE
THEY SHOULDN'T BE THERE
SOMETHING WAS VERY STRANGE
MORE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS
MISSING OUT ON TIME TO REST
I DO WANT TO IMPROVE
AND WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED
I DON'T THINK THERE'S THAT MUCH TIME LEFT NOW
NONE OF US HAD EVER SEEN A WHOLE CORONATION BEFORE
THE ORGAN WAS BOXED IN
AND WHEN SHE GOT BACK TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE
SHE HAD TO DIP IT IN A BASIN OF ICE TO GET IT OFF
IT WAS VERY PAINFUL
NOT LEAST BECAUSE ONE OF THE BISHOPS TOLD HER IT WAS OVER WHEN IT WASN'T AND SHE HAD TO COME BACK
AND IN QUEEN VICTORIA'S WORDS
ON THE DAY OF THE CORONATION
THEY DECIDED THAT THE MOST SACRED MOMENTS
THEN THE QUEEN HERSELF HAD TO INTERVENE ON BEHALF OF HER PEOPLE AND SAY
MY CORONATION SHOULD BE SEEN BY EVERYBODY
WOULDN'T GET IN THE WAY OF THE CEREMONY
BUT TO ALL SENSIBLE PEOPLE
TELLING US NOT WHAT THE NEWSPAPERS THOUGHT
WHAT THE BROADCASTERS THOUGHT
THIS IS THE EXTRAORDINARY ARCHIVE OF MASS OBSERVATION
WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO DO
AND FINALLY THE WHOLE SUBJECT IS DEBATED HERE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
BUT WE WILL ALLOW THEM TO ROAST OX
AS LONG AS THEY CAN PROVE AND SO BRITISH
THIS THAT THEY HAVE A TRADITION OF OX ROASTING
I GOT ON MY HANDS AND KNEES AND I CREPT BETWEEN THE PEOPLE IN THE CROWD
LOOK WHAT I'VE GOT
BANG ON THE SIDE
I WAS FOURTEEN AT THE TIME OF THE CORONATION
AND I LOOKED AHEAD AND THEY WERE CHEERING SOMEBODY WHO WAS SWEEPING THE ROADS
ANOTHER CHEER WENT UP
YOU WALKING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD
SO I JUST LEARNT IT ON THAT MORNING
AND THEN I DID THE ACTUAL OPENING
THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF TELEVISION
BUT I WAS THAT DAY
BUT IN THOSE DAYS I COULD LEARN VERY
YOU YOU SUPPOSED TO BE STANDING THERE
I'M A FAMOUS PHOTOGRAPHER IN FLEET STREET
DID SHE REALLY SAY THAT
A BRITISH SUBMARINE
WHICH YOU COULD HAVE SEEN ALMOST ANYWHERE IN BRITAIN
BUT THE AMERICANS TRIED TO REASSURE US
AND DO THEY HAVE CORONATIONS WHERE YOU COME FROM
AND ON THE DAY ITSELF
IT WAS TELEVISION THAT WON THE DAY
IN THE RUN UP TO THE CORONATION A MILLION SETS WERE SOLD
AND WHEN IT CAME TO THE FIRST BIG DECISION OF THE RAIN
POPULARITY WON OUT
IT HAD BEEN DECIDED THAT THIS SHOULD BE
EVEN OUR CHILDREN
IN THE WAKE OF THE TWENTY TWELVE CRISIS
THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN THE UNPRECEDENTED STEP OF MAKING PLANT HEALTH AS IMPORTANT AS ANIMAL HEALTH
WHERE THEY WILL COLLECT SAND GRAINS FROM AROUND THEM
FROM THE WATER COLUMN
AND THEN THEY WILL EXCRETE THIS CEMENT AND STICK THEM TOGETHER
ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT IN SIZE
IT CAN GROW VERY VERY QUICKLY
DOES IT MEAN IT WILL GO THE SAME WAY AS ELM IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY S AND BECOME A RURAL RARITY
AND BECAUSE I'VE GOT SO MANY DIFFERENT BREEDS AND SPECIES ON THE FARM
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL
UNTIL THEY STARTED TO BE INCUBATED
TO START OFF WITH
IT WAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
YOU ARE ACTUALLY IN THE CALENDAR
TRY SHOOTING A FEW THINGS
IT COULD BE ANYTHING
AND THAT THEY WEREN'T BEING LISTENED TO
THEN THEY THREW STONES AND TO SMASH WINDOWS
BECAUSE EMILY WILDING DAVISON AND ALL OF THE SUFFRAGETTES BELIEVED THAT A WOMAN'S PLACE WAS IN THE HOUSE OF
IT IS BOTH MIND BENDING AND FASCINATING TO THINK OF ALL THE DIFFERENT TACTICS USED AS ACTS OF
BUT THE STRUGGLE DIDN'T STOP THERE
WHICH ISN'T QUITE FAIR
AS MEN COULD DO IT FROM TWENTY ONE
WHEN THEY HUNGER STRUCK IN PRISON
I MIGHT ALREADY HAVE FIVE
THERE IS SO MUCH CONTRACEPTIVE CHOICE AVAILABLE TO US THAT IT JUST SEEMS NUTS TO IMAGINE HAVING
THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT FEAR OF PREGNANCY HANGING OVER THEM
THE PILL IS NINETY NINE PERCENT RELIABLE
I'M TALKING ABOUT ABORTION
ABORTION HAS BEEN AROUND FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS BUT ONLY BECAME LEGAL IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE
SO CALLED BACKTREET ABORTIONS WERE AVAILABLE
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN MOST WOMEN HAD NO CONTROL OVER WHEN THEY STARTED THEIR FAMILIES OR HOW BIG
I'VE BEEN HERE AT THE BBC FOR FOUR YEARS NOW AND I GET CHALLENGED EVERY SINGLE DAY
I CONTINUE TO LEARN THINGS
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
I FELT LIKE I COULD PRETTY MUCH DO ANYTHING
IF THEY HAD TO WORK
IT WAS STILL LEGAL TO PAY WOMEN MUCH LESS THAN MEN FOR DOING THE SAME JOB
THAT'S NOW ILLEGAL
THE LAW HAS CHANGED
WE STILL KNOW THERE'S A BIG PAY GAP
I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFERENT THE WORLD MUST HAVE BEEN BACK THEN FOR WOMEN
IT WAS SUNDAY NIGHT VIEWING
AND UNDER THIS ACT
WHETHER THAT BE A DISPLAY OF LAS MAGS IN SUPERMARKETS OR THE ADVERTISEMENTS THAT WE SEE IN
MEN IN THE VICTORIAN TIMES WANTED WOMEN TO BE PASSIVE AND NOW THEY WANT US TO BE SEX OBJECTS
IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE WE HAVEN'T COME VERY FAR AT ALL AND THE THREAT OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IS NEVER
BACK IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
TWO COUSINS COMPETED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN ORDER TO GAIN THE UPPER HAND IN THE PROPERTY STAKES
THAT LEGACY CREATED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT GARDENS IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND
THAT'S THE PRIORITY
SO THE AREA IS NOT DESPERATELY IMPORTANT
REALLY NICE MINIMALIST
I WANT YOU KNOW OPEN FIRES
MANCHESTER AND SHEFFIELD ALL CLOSE BY
RURAL PROPERTY IS IN HIGH DEMAND
LET'S MEET TODAY'S BUYERS
AND WE'VE HAD THEM IN LIVERY FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS
COMMANDEER THIS SPACE
IT'S THE ROOMS ARE SMALL
I LOVE THE HOUSE
THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR
THE GROUNDS GREAT
BECAUSE FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL
YESTERDAY WE FOUND OUT THAT PAMELA'S HORSES ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS MOVE
SO IN THAT RESPECT
I'D SAY THAT LAND IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE HOUSE
A BIT MORE SPACE AND A BIT MORE FEELING OF SPACE
I FEEL REALLY BAD ABOUT THIS
THIS IS A TWELVE BORE SHOTGUN
WHATEVER YOU DID THEN
IT'S TIME FOR THE MYSTERY PROPERTY
AND I'M QUIETLY CONFIDENT THAT THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY GONNA LOVE THIS HOUSE
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING THAT THEY'VE ASKED FOR
POTENTIAL GAMES ROOM
AND THREE STABLES
SO WHY IS IT THE MYSTERY PROPERTY
I WOULD SAY PERHAPS NINE HUNDRED
THAT IS GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY
THE PRIORITIES PAAR HORSES
IT SAYS WILLIAMS
YU AND I HOPE HE DOESN'T TAKE THAT THE WRONG WAY
YOU NEED A LOT OF IMAGINATION FOR THIS
MONEY DOESN'T MAKE YOU HAPPY
THIS IS TIMSON HOUSE
BECAUSE IT WAS A SHOE SHOP BUSINESS
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP CHANGING
PUTTING YOUR OWN
BUT SAN PAY WAS DIFFERENT
I WOULD DO AN HOUR'S PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE
SO WHEN THE CUSTOMER CAME IN THE NEXT MORNING
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
I USED TO HAVE ONE WHITE LEG AND ONE BROWN LEG IN THOSE DAYS BECAUSE IF I HAD TWO BROWN LEGS
PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS REAL
AND SO IT WAS INCREDIBLE
AND I'D DONE NOTHING
OBVIOUSLY AFTER THAT
IT WAS PHENOMENAL
YOU BUY A PRODUCT
AND THE GUY SHOWING ME AROUND WAS REALLY GOOD
SO I SLIPPED IN MY BUSINESS CARD AND SAID
NOT MANY BUSINESS BOSSES WOULD STAND HERE IN FRONT OF A PRISON SAYING
AND DAD ALWAYS SAID THAT
WHICH WAS RICH COMING FROM HIM
THERE'S NO SUCH WORD AS CANANT
THERE MUST BE A WAY ROUND
AND I THINK IF YOU HAVE THAT ATTITUDE
ABOUT SERVING CUSTOMERS
THEY'RE THE BRIGHTEST
AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT MAKE GREAT COBBLERS
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I INTERVIEW THEM A LOOK AT THEM IN THE EYE IS TO WORK OUT WHETHER I
TO HAVE AH HAVE ANOTHER GO AT SOMETHING
I LEARNED ALL THAT FROM DAD
GOING BACK TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BOARDROOM
WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY GREAT GRANDFATHER
IT MEANT THAT THAT ETHICS WERE VERY IMPORTANT
SO THEY COULDN'T SCREW ANYONE OVER ON BUSINESS IN BUSINESS
WHICH WAS VERY FAIR
WHAT'S GRADE FIVE
I DON'T THINK THAT
LAST YEAR IS A MUCH BETTER MEASURE
WE LEAVE OUR FINANCE DEPARTMENT
WE HAVE A BUDGET
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT
PROBABLY MORE THAN ANYTHING
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO BE AVAILABLE TO HELP PEOPLE
I'VE NEVER GOT THAT FAR
WE NEED TO HAVE MORE GIVERS
BECAUSE I'VE DONE THAT
IF I'M NOT DOING BUSINESS
WHAT WILL I BE DOING
NOT ALL THE TIME
AND WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH DISAPPEARING ON THE HIGH STREET RECENTLY
BUT PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHANGE THAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR BUSINESS AT THE MOMENT IS THAT MOST OF OUR
YOU WOULDN'T DO IT THAT WAY
WHEN VISITORS ARRIVE
I MUST SIT DOWN
SO TELL ME ABOUT IT
I'M VERY FOND OF QUEEN ALEXANDRA
I'M NOT ACTUALLY SURE
THIS IS A WONDERFUL BIT HERE WHICH I THINK
SO IN TERMS OF DATE
I FIND EVEN NATIONALITY VERY
YOU'D NEED PROBABLY AROUND ONE THOUSAND
WHERE DID SHE BUY IT FROM
YOU GET ONE LOT OF PLEASURE FROM A TOY
THEN ON THE FLIP SIDE
THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DOG RACE AND THE PRIZE WAS A SILVER CUP AND THE IDEA
UNLIKE SOME TOWNS IN THIS AREA
BUT I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL EVOCATION OF THE HARD TIMES IN NINETEEN FORTY
IMPRESSED WITH THAT
I RECALL IT FROM BEING A YOUNG CHILD AND MY DAD WOULD GET IT OUT OF HIS SECRET HIDDEN PLACE IN THE
EITHER MY RICH PEOPLE
TO GROW IN THE GREENHOUSE HERE
A FEW YEARS LATER
CAN OFINOIDS ON THE OTHER HAND
THAT YOU MIGHT SAY THESE ARE THE MOST ORDINARY OF CRIMES
THIS THURSDAY LAST
WHAT ELSE DID YOU TAKE FOR MRS COLLINS
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER IT
YOU ARE HEREBY ACQUITTED OF THE CHARGE AGAINST YOU
TOGETHER WITH ONE THOMAS COLEMAN
WHEREUPON THE NEXT MORNING
AND AN HOUR OR TWO AFTER
VALUE ONE SHILLING
THE GOODS OF BRIAN AMBLER
AS I WAS IN THE BACK ROOM OF MY SHOP
ONE OR TWO SPECIES OF MOTS OCCUR IN THESE LATITUDES BUT
THE ANSWER I WAS LOOKING FOR WAS LABOUR'S LEAD IS SLIPPING
ONCE THE SAYING
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG YOU'RE A SOCIALIST
BUT YOU PROMISED US
WHAT BURGER WAS IT
WHO WE EVERY WEEK SP OFF
HE MET KING ARTHUR
THEY GIVE YOU SOME BOOKS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOUR BODY
WHEN I FIND OUT NOWADAYS IF ANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE A CHILD
HE TALKS QUITE A LOT HE RABBITS ON A LOT
THE OTHER DAY HE WAS GOING
HE PLAYS COUNTY LEVEL RUGBY
HE'S ACTUALLY STRONGER THAN ME
I ACTUALLY CAN'T PHYSICALLY HURT THIS BOY
SO I SAT THERE AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND IT WAS AT THAT POINT I REALISED
WE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT
IF THAT TALKED ANYTHING LIKE US
VERY LARGE AMERICANS
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING
WHENEVER THEY BRING OUT A NEW THICKNESS OF GOOP
WHAT IS THE QUESTION
FOR HOW LONG COULD NEWLY DISCOVERED SHALE GAS RESERVES POWER THE UK
CONSIDERED TO BE MUCH HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT
OIL AND NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS
AND FOR WHAT COST
THE NORTH OF ENGLAND
HAPPENED TO ONE WOMAN'S TAP IN PENNSYLVANIA
IF THEY DO DO FRACKING ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE PENNINES
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE EU
YOU'RE SPYING ON ON RUSSIA
IN GRATITUDE FOR HIM REVEALING TO US THAT THE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN SPYING ON US
IT'S LOOKING A BIT DESPERATE
AND I'M TRAPPED IN THIS AIRPORT
YEAH JEREMY CAR HAS JUST GOT THE DNA RESULTS BACK
AH THE BRITISH REMAKE
IF YOU STRIKE ME DOWN NOW I SHALL BECOME MORE POWERFUL
SINCE YOU HAVE GOT YOUR LASER GUN TRAINED ON ME
HERE ARE THE SCI FI FOOTBALL RESULTS
YOU WILL ALMOST DEFINITELY DIE
I AM YOUR FATHER
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE
I COULD BE THE MAN OF YOUR DREAMS
KATIE PRICE SEEKS NEW HUSBAND
AH YOU WANTED TO BE A PRIEST
I'M LOOKING FOR A DOMINANT WOMAN
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS ATTEMPT TO BEAT POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ TEAM IN
I'M FIFTY THREE AND I'M A FINANCE MANAGER
YOU SAY NEITHER
IT'S QUITE CHALLENGING AT TIMES BUT
IF YOU'RE A ROCK STAR
I WOULD SAY I'M GOING TO GO
I THINK IT'S NOT NAMED AFTER AN INDIVIDUAL
I REMEMBER A BIG HARBOUR AND I KNOW
IF IT'S NOT ON THE C OF FINLAND
THE AMERICAN VERSION
THERE ARE RUMOURS THAT DR WILDE HAS
THESE DAYS I USE OTHER RESOURCES TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD
WE DON'T WANT TO RISK ANY DELAY
IF THAT HAPPENS
NOT ONLY WILL YOU BE UNABLE TO COMPETE
HE WORKED HARDER
I'M STOPPING NOW
I'M NOT SAYING IT
IT'S THE FACT THAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT WATER UNDER THE GROUND
I'M NOT DOING THAT YOU
I'M NOT DOING THIS AND
AS A COUNTRY YOU'RE MAKING SUCH A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY OFF YOUR RESOURCES BOOM
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD CHARACTERISE IT BUT
AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT
THE NEW EMERGING ASIAN SUPERPOWERS
BEFORE COMING HERE
I RATHER OUTRAGEOUSLY THOUGHT OF AUSTRALIA AS BEING A BIT OF EUROPE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET
WHEN YOU COME HERE
STILL QUITE A LONG WAY DOWN
AND THE REASON WHY IS TO WARM AN AREA WHEN THE AIR IS MIXING IS ACTUALLY HARD TO DO AND
SOMETHING LIKE HALF THE SIZE OF LONDON
IT WAS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER'S
SO THAT SOMEBODY AT NIGHT COULD HAVE JUST STRETCHED OUT
REALLY BECAUSE HE WAS TOLD TO DESTROY EVERYTHING
ONE OF THE GREAT NAMES OF THAT PERIOD
IT'S ALL FULL OF MOVEMENT AND GREAT FUN
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER HIM
I REMEMBER HIS WIFE
SO I REMEMBER HER AND NOT HIM
AND THERE IS A BUST OF MONEYS BY TRENT
IF THEY'RE POLISHED
MOST PEOPLE FIND HOSPITAL AN EASIER PLACE TO DEAL WITH
THE WAY I SEE IT
TANGLED AND CONFUSED AS IT IS
I HAD A FRIEND WHO LIVED UP THERE AND I'VE BEEN INVITED UP A COUPLE
THE MAN IN BLACK
KNOW THE ANSWER
DJS ARE THE MOST
WE ARE NOT LIKE ROCK STARS
ONE OF THE OLD WORDS TO DESCRIBE DJS IS A SELECTOR
I THINK IT WAS AH I THINK IT WAS A GREAT SCRIPT AND I THINK IT WAS AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THE RIGHT PLACE
WHEN YOU MEET A STAND UP COMEDIAN
PEOPLE ASK ALL THE MOST IRRELEVANT QUESTIONS
THE FIRST ONE MOST PEOPLE ASK
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION
THAT'S THE ONE THAT DOES KEEP US AWAKE
WHICH IS A VERY WELL KNOWN
ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED SEAT VENUE
STADIUM FILLING STARS WILL COME ON AND JUST DO A WARM UP GIG THERE THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY PLAY THE APOLLO
THAT'S NOT BEEN A MAJOR ISSUE IN MY CAREER
YOU THINK THAT THEY WILL HOLD THE AUDIENCE
BUT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO LIVE ON THEIR W
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
DO JOIN US AGAIN FOR MORE CELEBRITY MASTERMIND
EVEN THEIR VILLAGE IN THE VALLEY IS VERY REMOTE
WHEN WE ALL TURN UP THEY JUST THINK
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW
THE WHOLE VILLAGE IS GOING TO MOVE AND WE'LL GET A SENSE OF THE TRUE SCALE OF THE
AND YOU JUST WANT TO GO
SO LET ME GET ON AND DO IT
IN A WORLD THAT IS UPSIDE DOWN AND SOMETIMES
AND THAT IT WAS A VERY SEXY
THE BIGGER THAN MOST PONDS
I'VE BEEN HERE TWICE BEFORE
THAT'S THE WRONG WORD
GARDENS HAVE DIFFERENT STYLES
SO WE DECIDE ON THE STYLE WE WANT AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
DOESN'T JUST MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S REAL AND COLD
AND HOW TO MIX THEM AND HOW TO USE THEM
THAT I COULD GO IN AND WALK AROUND
NEARLY FORTY YEARS LATER
JUST JUST FOR A SECOND
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT
WHICH IS NOT A WORD YOU WOULD ASSOCIATE
COME AND JOIN US
JUST WORKS SUPERBLY WELL
THINGS MAKE SENSE
LINES GOT COMPLICATED
THIS IS A HUGE CITY
IN THIS COUNTRY
THIS MIGHT LOOK BEAUTIFUL
BECAUSE OF POLLUTION
OUR FOUR CELEBRITY CONTENDERS WILL FACE TELEVISION'S ULTIMATE TEST OF NERVE AND KNOWLEDGE
THEY WILL HAVE TO ANSWER ONE AND HALF MINUTES ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND TWO MINUTES ON GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
IF FOOD IS AN INTEREST AND I AM VERY INTERESTED IN IT
AND WE TALK OURSELVES DOWN RELENTLESSLY ALL THE TIME WHICH IS WRONG
YOU KNOW LATER ON IN LIFE
IF YOU GET BIGGER ROLES AND THINGS
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS ATTEMPT TO BEAT POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ TEAM IN
I'M FIFTY TWO AND I'M TEAM GB ARCHERY TEAM LEADER
I'M TWENTY EIGHT AND I'M A PROJECT MANAGER
I'M TWENTY FIVE AND I TRAIN FULL TIME AS AN OLYMPIC ARCHER
I'M FORTY EIGHT AND I'M AN INTERNATIONAL ARCHERY JUDGE
WHICH WON THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT MAN BOOKER PRIZE
IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE TRAPPED
DE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR
WHICH ARTIST PAINTED MERRY GO ROUND
BEFORE I GOT THE MEDAL
IT WAS QUITE FUNNY
WHAT DO YOU UM
I HAVEN'T GOT ROUND TO COUNTY SIDES
IT'S TIME FOR OUR FINAL ROUND
EVERY MONTH THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF LOTS ON OFFER
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE STARTING A BUSINESS
YOU'VE MANAGED TO GET YOUR FINANCES AVAILABLE
A FORMER LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSE AT A GUIDE PRICE OF SIXTY
SMALL THOUGH IT IS
THAT DOESN'T CONCERN ME
MORE THAN A WEEKEND'S WORK TO SORT THIS ONE OUT
BUT WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE INTRINSICALLY IS A SOLID HOUSE IN A GOOD AREA
OR GOOD RENTAL POTENTIAL
EVEN IN DIFFICULT TIMES BUT
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT NOW
AS IT'S A RATHER UNUSUAL LOCATION
HERE IN THE TOWN OF SUNBURY ON THAMES IS A SERIES OF LITTLE ISLANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER
WHEATLEY'S EIGHT IS THE ONE OUR LOT IS ON TODAY
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT IT'S NOT MADE OF BRICK OR STONE WALLS WITH A SLATE OR TILED ROOF
BUT WHOEVER BOUGHT THIS WOULD BE RUNNING A RISK OF BOTH THE HOUSE FLOODING AND PROBLEMS GETTING
CONSIDERING THE LOCATION AND TYPE OF PROPERTY THEY'VE NOT GONE OVERBOARD
YOU WOULD PUT THIS ON THE MARKET FOR AROUND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND
GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO JIGGLE THINGS AROUND WHICH I THINK IT REALLY NEEDS
APART FROM THAT
POSSIBLY AS IT IS AT THIS MOMENT
ANYTHING I CAN GET TOWARDS THE EIGHTY
SO THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME OUT AS WELL
WILL THERE BE BRICK DUST AND LADDERS ALL OVER THE PLACE
IT'S A BIT OF A DEAD SPACE OTHERWISE
SPECIAL WONDERFUL PLACE
YOU'D NEVER WANT TO SELL THIS
IT WAS WINTER TIME
WHICH IS ALSO AN ARCHITECTURAL DETAIL OF THE BUILDING AS WELL WHICH GIVES IT QUITE A DRAMATIC
EVERYTHING HE'S USED
I WELL UNDER THE EIGHT
EVER FORGIVE ME
AND THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF AUCTIONS HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
UM THE PLACE IS CHARMING
IT'S ALL JUST GREAT
LOOKING FOR HOUSES OVER THAT TIME
MUCH FASTER THAN WE ANTICIPATED
CHICKENS AND THAT SORT OF THING
YOU WOULDN'T WANT THAT
SO A GUIDE PRICE OF FIVE THOUSAND
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
THEY SAY THINGS COME IN THREES
HAVE A GO AT IT
IF IT COMES IN AT A GOOD PRICE
SO TO AVOID THAT
AND THE STREETS ARE FEATURED IN NUMEROUS FILMS
IT'S NO SURPRISE
IT IS NICE AND LIGHT
TEND TO BE EITHER CITY OR MEDIA BASED
IT IS A TINY PLACE
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE AROUND ME WHO WERE ALSO LOOKING
HALF WAY THROUGH
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO NOW
IT WAS MY DREAM HOUSE
COLIN HAS GOT SOME PRETTY AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR THIS PLACE
REPLACING THE ROOF
THE NEIGHBOURS ARE ONE STEP AHEAD AND THEY'VE ALREADY DONE SO
SO HOPEFULLY HE WON'T HAVE ANY PLANNING PROBLEMS
THE QUESTION IS
WILL THE EXTRA SPACE BRING IN THE EXTRA CASH
JOIN US LATER IN THE PROGRAMME AND FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS
WE HAD THE COLDEST WINTER IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS
A SUBSTANTIAL HOUSE FOR NOT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY
I'LL BE DOING THE BASIC WORK MYSELF
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT WHAT PARTNER CHERYL THINKS
AND WILL THAT AREA OF GRASS AT THE BACK PROVE TO BE A PROBLEM
THEY'VE BOUGHT THE PROPERTY
THE AUCTION WAS WHILE I WAS ON HOLIDAY
BUT FOR THE NEXT FIVE OR SIX YEARS
AND THE SHAPE OF SHAPE OF SOME OF THE BEDROOMS
IT'S BEEN A GREAT EXPERIENCE
PARTICULARLY THE HANGING BEING SO LOW LEVEL
THAT WASN'T REALLY THE MAIN AIM OF OF THE PROJECT
I'M A RETIRED CRAFT CENTRE OWNER
I'M SIXTY TWO AND I'M A RETIRED TEACHER AND CHILDMINDER
I THINK YOUR COLLAR BONE IS YOUR CLAVICLE
BATHES ALL THE TISSUES IN THE BODY
FOR THAT REASON
I MIGHT GO INTO BANKING OR SOMETHING SIMILAR
I THINK IT'S PRINCE
I ONLY KNOW ONE OF THEM BY NAME
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GET IT
WHICH FEATURED THE SONGS
SO THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
IT'S NOT JUST TWO UP
TWO DOWNS LYING EMPTY
JUST BEING DOWN IN THE ENGINE ROOM
I THINK THEY'VE GOT SOME INVALUABLE ADVICE WHICH WOULD BE BRILLIANT FOR YOU TO HEAR
THE SAME PRINCIPLES APPLY
WITH HARD GRAFT
IMAGINATION AND MOTIVATION
IT HAD BEEN USED AS A PRINT WORKSHOP
AND THAT GOT IN THE WAY OF FAMILY THINGS
GOT IN THE WAY OF BEING NICE TO MY WIFE
WELL IT'S GREAT TO HEAR ABOUT AN ORGANISATION DEDICATED NOT JUST TO REJUVENATING BUILDINGS BUT ALSO TEACHING
I'M JOHN HUMPHRIES AND WELCOME TO CELEBRITY MASTERMIND
THERE'S STILL A HUGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE FOR WHOM THE COMMON LANGUAGE IS WHAT THEY SAW ON TV AND
I STARTED OUT WITH MY PARTNER JOE CORNISH COMEDY PARTNER MAKING SORT RECREATIONS OF FILMS AND
AND I FIND THAT RATHER ROMANTIC
WHICH IS A TWELVE VOLUME THING
AND I WAS ON NUMBER ELEVEN
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THAT
BUT IT WAS THE LAST VOLUME IN THAT CYCLE
AND IT WAS SHINY AND GORGEOUS AND I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE A SUITABLY CEREMONIAL WAY TO FINISH
IT JUST SOUNDS REALLY STRANGE
I WENT IN AND ASKED HOW MUCH IT COST
BUT I BOUGHT IT
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
WELL TODAY WE'LL MEET PEOPLE HOPING TO HAVE FOUND THEIR PERFECT PROPERTY
IF WE COME IN UNDER BUDGET
SURVEY FEES AND SEARCHES
SO GOOD SCHOOLS IN THE AREA
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU
SO WE'VE SEEN THE BATHROOM
WITH A FLAT LIKE THIS
THREE SEVENTY ONE FOR THE FIRST
WITH TRANSPARENT BATHROOM DOORS
THREE SEVENTY ONE FOR THE SECOND
BARN CONVERSIONS AND STUFF
IF WE CAN RENT IT FOR THE RIGHT MONEY
WE AGAIN WE TOOK ALL THE PLASTER OFF THE WALLS
ALL TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST PROJECT
THOUSAND WOULD COVER WHAT WHAT WE'VE INVESTED IN IT
IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A GOOD EXPERIENCE
THAT'S WHAT THIS HOUSE NEEDS
SMALL SHOWER ROOM
AND CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE WIRING
WILL THE PROPERTY I'M HERE TO SEE BE A DREAM OR A BIT OF A NIGHTMARE
AN INVESTMENT PROPERTY
BUT APPARENTLY WITH THE EXTENSION
WILL FORMER COALFACE ELECTRICIAN TONY TURN THIS PLACE INTO A GOLD
VERY PLEASED WITH IT
AH BOTH MY PARENTS ARE LATVIAN
WHOEVER ANSWERS THE MOST QUESTIONS CORRECTLY IS THE WINNER
I'M NOT SURE IT'S WISE
BUT I'M GONNA GO SECOND
IMAGES STARTED FLITTING THROUGH MY MIND
JOHN REID DESCRIBED ELEMENTS OF WHICH GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT AS NOT FIT FOR
I DON'T THINK PAT CASH WON ELEVEN GRAND SLAMS
I CAN'T REMEMBER
IT'S BEEN LIKE THAT AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER
IT WAS THE FINEST TIME OF MY LIFE WORKING OUT DOORS
WHEN YOU FIRST READ THE QUESTION
SO I'M GOING TO GO FOR THAT
AND BUT I'M NOT SURE
THE EGGHEADS HAVE A RULE THAT IF IF ONE OF THE OPTIONS IS PACIFIC
SOME EIGHTY YEARS LATER
THIS WAS A STRATEGIC STRONGHOLD
THE MORE YOU LOOK AT THEM
HE WAS A MUCH MUCH LOVED UNCLE
BUT MY FATHER WAS VERY
VERY FOND OF HIM
THAT IS EXACTLY THE SAME
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT
BECAUSE YOU HAD LEISURE TIME
THAT YOU COULD SIT QUIETLY AND BE OCCUPIED
AND I'M GLAD THAT IT WILL BE
AFTER THE WEDDING SERVICE
COMPENSATION FOR THE COW
AND SO THERE WAS A FINANCIAL LOSS INVOLVED
FOUR YEARS LATER
ANYTHING TO DO WITH SORT OF FARMING AND THE OUTDOORS
WE NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO TURN UP
AND SOMETIMES THE MOST UNLIKELY THINGS ARE BROUGHT ALONG
PEOPLE THINK THAT BLACK SPOT IS PROBABLY TARNISH
IF YOU ASK ANYBODY IN SILVER
RIGHT AT A YOUNG AGE
HE'S REALLY FLYING HIGH
WHAT WOULD BE THEIR DREAM OBJECT IF IT TURNED UP ON THEIR TABLE
GOING INTO THE FAR
WHEN YOU SEE THEM LIKE THAT
SO WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH YOUR HE YOU
IF YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH
IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE HOUSE IS FINISHED OF WHICH OF THOSE MARKETS IT WOULD ADDRESS
THREE BEDROOMS AND AND A BATHROOM
I WOULD SEE THE SALE PRICE OF THIS HOUSE TO A PROFESSIONAL INVESTOR AT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
YOU DON'T NEED TO STUDY THE FIGURES TOO HARD OR HAVE A DEGREE IN DEVELOPMENT TO REALIZE IT'S A FIRST
TO DO THE WHOLE PROPERTY
WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING BUDGETING AROUND TWENTY THREE
JOHN CERTAINLY SEEMS TO HAVE CRACKED THE STUDENT MARKET
SIDE BUT THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY
WELL TODAY HOPEFULLY WE'LL MEET SOME BUYERS WHO DID JUST THAT
THIS WOULD MAKE A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY HOME
I DON'T THINK SO
YOU ARE IN THE HEART OF STUDENT LAND HERE
EASY ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITIES
ALL THE BARS AND CLUBS ON YOUR DOORSTEP
THE CHANCE OF HAVING YOUR OWN FRONT DOOR AND MAYBE A BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY
HELPING TO MAINTAIN PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN HOMES
BUT WILL SHE BE SO RELAXED ON MOVING DAY
APPLICATION NOW HAVING SAID THAT
FORTY I'M LOOKING FOR
THOUSAND POUNDS ON THE PROPERTY
GENERAL IN THE FIRST YEAR
BENEFITS OF THE GARDEN
COULD IT BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE POTENTIAL SUBSIDENCE
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN WELL LOOKED AFTER
IT'S HAD SOME MONEY SPENT FOR NEW WINDOWS
ONE IS TO PUT UP WITH IT
THATS GOING TO HIT DEMAND ON THE HOUSE
BUT THEY ARE LONG TERM MENTORS
THIS WAS RE PLASTERED AND THE CUPBOARDS PUT IN
WE REALISED THAT THE LEVEL OUT HERE WAS HIGHER AS WELL
QUIET BIT FOR A WHILE WITHOUT ANY DUST AND DIRT
SO THE GIRLS COME STRAIGHT IN TO US
BUT THE MAIN WORK WAS PROBABLY ABOUT SIX
WE'LL START NEXT WEEK GETTING QUOTES FOR THE CENTRAL HEATING
I'M TEMPTED TO REPLACE THE DOORS AS WELL
THAT SHOULD NEVER BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
AND THEY SHOULD MAKE SURE THEY GET A GOOD SURVEY BEFORE THEY START ANY MAJOR WORK
BUT APART FROM THAT
LOCATION AND PRICE
AND WE SAW THIS ONE
AND IT'S A GOOD PRICE AND
BUT I MEAN MY WIFE HAS BEEN DOING IT FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS
UM SO WE THOUGHT UM WE'LL COME OVER HERE
IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE I GOT A CALL UP TO SAY THAT WOULD I LIKE TO WORK IN CHINA FOR FOUR MONTHS
AND ALSO CHOREOGRAPHING AS WELL
WE STILL HAVE OUR OWN WORK
I NORMALLY GO TO
THEN WENT BACK INTO EDUCATION
WENT TO DRAMA SCHOOL AND GRADUATED IN NINETY THREE
THEN CONTINUED WITH THE ACTING
AND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO AUCTIONS IN CHINA
CAN THEY REALLY SORT THIS PLACE OUT FOR JUST SIX
IF YOU WERE TO TO DRIVE FROM HERE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
YOU REALLY ARE A BRISK TWENTY MINUTE WALK TO THE NEAREST OVERLAND STATION NOT UNTHINKABLE AS A
THIS FLAT IS A HOT
AND IT COULD MAKE SOMEBODY SOME DECENT CASH
I STARTED UP IN THIS AREA BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE
ONE AND A THREE BED FLAT
WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE
IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME ROUTINE ON EVERYTHING WE TOUCH AND
AND THE SAME FORMAT
YOU MAY NOT GET THE EXTRA UPLIFT IN THE VALUE THAT YOU SPEND ON THE EXTENSION
WHICH IS SOLID WOOD FLOORING
WITHOUT THE EXTENSION
WITH THE EXTENSION
ADD ANOTHER TEN
MANSUR IS A MAN WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING
SO RENTAL POTENTIAL
LET'S CHECK THE OTHER
CEILINGS AND THEN THERE WERE LITTLE BITS OF PROBLEMS WITH ALL THE OTHER CEILINGS
GET RID OF ALL THE CEILINGS
AND I THINK WE WOULD'VE STUCK TO THAT IF WE'D COME TO THE ORIGINAL PLANS OF KEEPING THE CHIMNEY
WE NEEDED TO DO ALL OF THESE EXTRA REPAIRS TO THE HOUSE
IT WAS STILL YOU KNOW GOOD VALUE FOR WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE
THEY'VE DONE A GREAT JOB
SOMETIMES YOU TRY TO FIND PROBLEMS IN PROPERTIES
VERY CLOSE TO TOWN
VERY QUIET AREA
SO A NICE NICE FEEL TO IT
NICE TOUCH TO IT
AND IT WOULD SELL
A REALLY NICE HOUSE IN A GOOD AREA
WHAT IS THERE NOT TO LIKE ABOUT THIS PLACE
LET'S SEE WHO FANCIED IT WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
I DO LIKE GARDENING
YOUR NORMAL LIFE
THIS IS AN IN BETWEEN
TIME HAS PASSED
ONE BEDROOM FLAT
AND WE DID RECEIVE A CLOSE TO ASKING PRICE OFFER YESTERDAY
THAT WHATEVER WORK WE HAD DONE UP TO THAT POINT WASN'T GOING TO BE UNDONE
WE TOOK EVERYTHING OUT ALL THE PLASTICWORK
SO YOUR BUDGET IS PRETTY MUCH SPOT ON
AND YEARS YOU CAN'T GET IT WRONG
AND THAT'S MAINLY BECAUSE WE'VE ADDED A WET ROOM AT THE REAR
SO WE'VE COME PRETTY MUCH CLOSE INTO THE PENNY
DONE ALL THE USUAL THINGS
WHICH IS WHITE WALLS
WHAT I HAD TO DO
BECAUSE EVERY EVERY TIME YOU COME ONTO A NEW PROJECT
YOU HAVE A SMALL OPPORTUNITY TO BE A BIT MORE CREATIVE
BUT IT IS A CHALLENGE
MAYBE IN THE FUTURE
AND WE HOPE WE'VE INSPIRED YOU AND GIVEN YOU AN INSIGHT INTO THE WORLD OF AUCTIONS HERE ON HOMES
AND TIME CONSUMING
IT'S NEATLY PRESENTED
I WOULD PUT THIS ON THE MARKET AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND
WOULD NOT BE THE SAME AS SITTING IN OUR OWN BACK GARDEN WITH FRIENDS
JOIN THE PRIVACY
OF THAT VERY TREE
IT'S BEEN GIVEN THE NICKNAME SON OF ROYAL OAK
CLOSE TO LOCAL AMENITIES
YOU'RE ONLY AN HOUR OR SO AWAY FROM BIRMINGHAM AND MANCHESTER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS
AND THEY JUST OPENED A DIRECT TRAIN LINK FROM SHREWSBURY DOWN TO LONDON
STILL PEOPLE DO MOVE HERE BECAUSE OF THE LOVELY COUNTRYSIDE AND
SHROPSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL ARE THE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY TO DEVELOP A BIODIVERSITY STRATEGY
NOW ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY
HOW'S THAT GOING TO BE
BUT HERE IN WONDERFUL SHROPSHIRE
I'M SAD TO SAY THAT YOU'RE CLOSER
IT'S GREAT BECAUSE IT BRINGS ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS INTO THE OPEN
I LOVE THIS PROPERTY
I'VE COME TO BASKETBALL HOUSE RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF SHROPSHIRE
WHICH IS HOME TO THE FAMOUS ROYAL OAK BUT ALSO TO SOME VERY INGENIOUS ROYAL HIDEY HOLES
BECAUSE WE LEARN QUITE A LOT ABOUT STEVE AND JACKIE'S PROPERTY PREFERENCES
MOST OF YOUR SLEEPING IS DOWNSTAIRS
SPACE WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE LITTLE BIT TOO MODERN FOR ME INSIDE
BUT ON A WHOLE
IS CEMENTED OUR MINDS THAT
THE SHOW AND A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
I'M SIXTY NINE YEARS OLD
I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK IF RED OCTOBER WAS STOLEN
TEN MORE STEPS ON THE ROAD OF LIFE
HIS ORIGINAL NAME WAS WOLFRAM
I LIKE TO OFFICIATE AT ATHLETICS
I THINK HE DID REALLY
A BOIL AND A HAYSTACK SOUNDS QUITE PLAUSIBLE
SO I SHALL GO FOR CANOEING
SO IT'LL BE A WILD GUESS
BRITANNIA SPRINGS OUT AT ME
I'LL TAKE THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE
SECURED THE RULE OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
BATTLE OF MANILA BAY
TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND WHICH AS ALWAYS
BECAUSE IT WAS BASED AROUND TIMBUKTU
BUT EVERY TIME HE POPS UP IN THE BOOK
IT'S SUDDENLY SO FULL OF FUN AND ENERGETIC
THEY'D BE RULING THE WORLD
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DR THREE
HOW DID YOU COME TO BELIEVE THAT YOU COULD ACT
I TELL YOU THAT
YOU PLAYING A DOCTOR
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE DOG THAT BIT YOU
SO IT WASN'T A WASTEED TRIP
IT'S LIKE ME AND THOSE MONKEYS' BOTTOMS
I DON'T HAVE RABIES
I'M NOT HAVING THAT
THEY'VE MADE A MISTAKE
LOOK HOW FAR I GOT
THE SHOW HAD A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
I'M THIRTY THREE AND I'M ALSO A MEMBERSHIP RECRUITER
I PICKED THE CATEGORIES FROM FROM THE SHOW
IT'S A KIND OF SOUND
IF I DO IT IN THE FORM OF THE TUNE
IN A FIT OF JEALOUSY
WATCHING THE SHOW
IT SEEMS LIKE THE TEAM THAT NORMALLY GOES FIRST LOSES
FOR SOME REASON
SO I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A LONG PERIOD OF TIME ISN'T
THERE'S A WHOLE AREA OF LONDON
CAPTAIN MATTHEW WEBB
PAN SAYS THEY DON'T
WELCOME TO E
THOSE RACES MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ME
THIS I WOULDN'T KNOW
IF I REMEMBER RIGHT
UM IT'S A BIT OF A GUESS
I'M GOING TO GO WITH LA FEED
I MIGHT HAVE GUESSED VAN MORRISON
IT IS THE FINAL ROUND
WHEN I HEARD THE THREE NAMES
UNTIL THEN FROM ALL OF US HERE
I'M FIFTY NINE AND I'M AN ACCOUNTS CLERK
I'M FIFTY SIX AND I AM A SCHOOL LIBRARIAN
BUT I DO LIKE THOSE KIND OF PROGRAMS
TEN IS TOO MANY
AND THE FILM WAS CALLED YENTL
I THINK HE PLAYED A PRIEST IN THAT FILM
AND I THINK IT'S BING CROSBY
SO I THINK IT PROBABLY IS THE GRANDFATHER PARADOX
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE
CAME BACK TO THE SPORT AFTER HE RETIRED FROM THE CHICAGO BULLS
AS FAR AS I'M AWARE
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
INCLUDING BEST VIDEO
JOIN US NEXT TIME TO SEE IF A NEW TEAM OF CHALLENGERS HAVE THE BRAINS TO DEFEAT THE EGGHEADS
THOUSAND POUNDS SAYS THEY DON'T
ONCE WE GOT OVER THAT
NOT ONLY OF MY FATHER'S WORK BUT OF OF THE ANCESTORS
MY GRANDPARENTS AND THE ANCESTORS BEFORE THAT WHO'VE REALLY SHAPED THE PLACE
I THINK TO BE HONEST
BUT YOU WON'T GET THE PEOPLE
YOU'VE LIVED HERE FOR OVER FORTY YEARS
THIS IS OPEN SPACE
BUT IT ENDURED A CONCENTRATED ATTACK SO VIOLENT IT BECAME THE MOST BOMBED PLACE ON EARTH
THIS MAY SEEM OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE ISLAND'S SIZE
BUT IT UNDERLINED ITS CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE
FOR THIS TINY PIECE OF ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA HELD THE KEY TO THE ENTIRE
JUST FIFTEEN MINUTES' FLYING TIME FROM MALTA
THERE WAS CARICATURE IN THE PAPER SAYING
BUT THEY'D FOUGHT ON
AH WITH EVERY WEEK
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE ISLAND QUICKLY HAD SLIPPED AWAY
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME I LOOKED UP
SEVENTY GERMANS BOMBING
YOU'RE ON A TINY ISLAND WITH NO CHANCE OF ESCAPE
BEING BOMBED TO HELL DAY IN
BUT IMAGINE BEING ON A SUBMARINE
THE RELIEF WAS HUGE
SO HITLER TURNED ONCE MORE TO THE WAR HERE IN THE SOUTH
UP TO THIS POINT
THE ITALIANS HAD FAILED TO INVADE WHEN MALTA HAD BEEN DEFENSIVELY VULNERABLE
AND THE GERMANS HAD NEVER FULLY FOCUSED ON DEALING WITH THE ISLAND
SO AXIS FORCES IN NORTH AFRICA BEGAN TO SUFFER
GERMANY REALISED THAT SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF MALTA WAS THE KEY TO WINNING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
DESPITE BETTER PLANES BEING AVAILABLE BACK IN BRITAIN
BUT BRITAIN HAD NOW WOKEN UP TO THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF THE ISLAND'S POSITION
WE WERE ALWAYS RIGHTS
WHAT HAD BEEN ADEQUATE BEFORE WAS NOW FOUND WANTING
AND DESPITE LOW CLOUD PREVENTING ENEMY RAIDS
FOR TWO WHOLE NIGHTS
SO WHEN THREE OUT OF FOUR SHIPS REACHED THE ISLAND SAFELY
THE RELIEF WAS IMMENSE
BUT GETTING HERE WAS ONLY HALF THE JOB
NO EXTRA HANDS WERE BROUGHT IN TO HELP WITH THE UNLOADING
NOT ONE SERVICEMAN
THEY SLEPT DOWN THERE
BUT IT WASN'T ANNOUNCED IN THE TIMES OF MALTA UNTIL THE SEVENTEENTH
OF ALL THE PEOPLE
AND I ALWAYS SAY
RIGHT FROM A GRANDPA
RIGHT DOWN TO A CHILD
WE ALL TOOK PART
WHERE HE AND TWO OTHER SPITFIRES TAKE OFF TO INTERCEPT MORE THAN FIFTY ENEMY AIRCRAFT
WHAT'S SO INCREDIBLE IS THE IMMEDIACY OF IT
BUT TO HELP THEM
NOW HAD TEN TWIN ENGINED BOMBERS WITH WHICH TO TAKE THE ATTACK TO THE ENEMY
COMPARED WITH WHAT THEY WERE UP AGAINST
NO WONDER DENNIS LEFT FEELING EVEN MORE TERRIFIED THAN EVER
UM THEN EXPLODED ALMOST ON TOP OF THEM
THE WHOLE BUILDING SHOOK
BUT AS THE DUST SETTLED
AS I WAS SAYING
THE GERMANS ARE COWARDS AND BULLIES
WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RESPITE CAME TO A DRAMATIC HALT WITH THE ARRIVAL OF YET MORE ENEMY
EVEN IN A TINY FIELD LIKE THIS
BUT IN ACTUAL FACT
AND WAS ABLE TO BAIL OUT BUT
YOU CAN'T BAKE BREAD
NOW TANTALIS ANY CLOSE
NO ONE ON BOARD
THE MOST IMPORTANT DATE IN MALTA'S CALENDAR THE FEAST DAY OF SANTA MARIA
THE ALLIES TURNED NORTH TO SICILY
LYING JUST SIXTY MILES AWAY
AND NOW SWARMING WITH AIRCRAFT
THE SIEGE HAD BEEN LIFTED AND THE CONVOYS WERE GETTING THROUGH
IN A MATTER OF MONTHS
THE RAF HAD REGAINED CONTROL OF THE SKIES
HER STRIKE FORCES WERE SINKING MORE ACTOR SHIPPING THAN EVER BEFORE AND SHE HAD IN PLACE THE
THE THE FIRST PART OF THAT JOB IS ABOUT TRYING TO UNPICK THE BEHAVIOUR
I WAS I WAS TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD AND THIS IS LIKE
FOR A WILDLIFE CAMERAMAN
FOR A YOUNG WILDLIFE CAMERAMAN
WHAT'S GOING ON
NO SHIPS HAD BEEN LOST IN THESE WATERS AND NOW THREE SHIPS HAVE BEEN SUNK IN NEARLY AS MANY DAYS
AFTER THE EXPLOSION
BY HIS RECKONING
WAS SURVEYED EVERYWHERE
NO SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO PINPOINT THE CRASH SITE OF THE SPITFIRE SO IT LOOKS LIKE EFFECTIVELY
LIKE CRUSHING AN ALUMINIUM DRINKS CAN
THIS IS ABOUT AS FAR WEST AS YOU CAN GET IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
IT WAS CLEARLY VITALLY IMPORTANT TO USE THIS AREA AS A BASE
THAT'S AN AIRCRAFT
ALANRO HAD TOM AND THEN MY FATHER
HE WAS FIT AND WELL
AND TWO DAYS AFTER LANDING
FORTY FIVE MINUTE FIGHT
HE TRIED TO FIRE IT FROM THE HIP
THERE IS A PROCEDURE FOR UNJAMMING A BRAIN
BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME
YOU KIND OF THINK
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THIS
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR DAD
QUITE A BIT HAS CHANGED
WE HAVE NEW DRAGONS
NEW DANGERS FOR ENTREPRENEURS
LOUISE FERGUSON AND KATE COTTON
IT WOULD BE MORE TRUE
MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF CASH AND THEN COME HERE
YOU CAN HAVE THAT IN THE UK MARKET
TO GIVE YOU THE DRIVE TO TO BE THE
IF I SELL IT WHOLESALE
WHERE'S THE BENEFIT IN THE FEEDBACK
YOU MIGHT FIND SOMEBODY THAT IS WILLING NOT JUST TO PUT IN EIGHTY
THERE'S A STAGGERING CHOICE OF FAST FOOD DINING OPTIONS ON OUR HIGH STREETS
WHEN YOU SPEND A HUNDRED HOURS IN THE BUSINESS EVERY WEEK
NEXT UP IS ROSS MENDHAM
POUND HE USED TO BE A PERSONAL TRAINER
DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
MARKETING AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
MANAGED TO CONVINCE PETER JONES HIS BRAND HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY FOR ROSS
BUT THE CONVERSATION ABOUT ALL OF TONIGHT'S PITCHES CONTINUES ON TWITTER
YOU HAVE TO DELIVER QUALITY DISHES
THE BEST OF THE SITUATION
THIS IS THE BEST I'M ABOUT TO GIVE YOU
CALLED APPLES AND PEARS
IT WAS AMBITIOUS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT IS BEAUTIFUL
IT WAS TERRIFYING
NO COOKING DISASTERS
ON THE SOUTH AMERICAN CONTINENT
ON THE BANKS OF THE RIO NEGRO
VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF AMAZONIA
IT WANTS TO MAKE ROOTS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS INCREDIBLY NOISY
AND WHEN HE CAME BACK
THE SITE IS SUPPOSED TO BE REALLY DRAMATIC
I PUT SOME PLANTS
AND YET WHAT IT DOES HAVE IS THAT INTENSE ENTHUSIASM AND CREATIVITY WHICH IS VERY
ADD ALL THESE FACTORS TOGETHER AND A BAD SUMMER CAN MEAN THE BEES WILL FAIL TO SURVIVE A MILD
THEY JUST WON'T LEAVE THE HIVE
THE NE TO OUTPUT OF FLOWERS IS ALSO TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT
SO IF IT'S COLDER
AND IF THE WEATHER'S BAD WHEN NEW VIRGIN QUEENS GO ON THEIR MATING FLIGHT
AND I THOUGHT I'D HAVE A
MAYBE THE OCCASIONAL BUMBLEBEE
WHO DOES THE REST
HERE IN BRITAIN
WHICH RAISES AN IMPORTANT QUESTION
SO TO THEM THIS CORRIDOR IS DARK
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FLY OUT HERE
WHICH ARE VERY EFFECTIVE INSECTICIDES
VERY LOW MAMMALIAN TOXICITY
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S BEEN SHOWN
WHICH RAISES THE RATHER TROUBLING QUESTION AS TO WHETHER WE'VE MISSED THE REAL ISSUE ALTOGETHER
VERY POLITE AND FRIENDLY BEES
WE'VE DEVELOPED PESTICIDES
WE'VE CHANGED AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES
THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING CALLED GREEN HAY SPREADING
NASH RETURNED TO THE LANDSCAPE THAT HAD ORIGINALLY INSPIRED HIM
HE WAS EMOTIONALLY SHATTERED BY WHAT HE'D SEEN AND HE WAS A DYING MAN
NOW OUR BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE WOULDN'T BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A FIELD FULL OF FARM ANIMALS
A GROWING NUMBER OF THIEVES ARE SEEING AN OPPORTUNITY
IT TOOK PUBLICITY IN THE FARMING PRESS
SHARP EYED MEMBERS OF THE RURAL COMMUNITY
CUTTING EDGE SCIENCE
BUT PERHAPS MOST OF ALL
WHERE SHE WOULD GO
SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO LEARN THE HABIT OF GOING TO WORK
IT'S BECOME A BYPRODUCT OF AGRICULTURE WITH A HUMAN VALUE SO HUGE
BUT THE TAGS DOESN'T MEAN A THING TO THEM
I'M AFRAID THERE ISN'T A FINAL PAGE TURN WHERE WE REVEAL WHO DONE IT
THERE ARE JUST TOO FEW PROSECUTIONS
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT MORE FARMERS ARE ON THEIR GUARD AND WE'RE ALL BEING ASKED TO BE CAREFUL
WITH THE LAMBS THAT ARE BORN
THE FEMALES WE KEEP IN THE FLOCK TO REPLACE THE OLD GIRLS THAT ARE GOING OUT AND THEN WE SELL A FEW
THEY ORIGINALLY CAME FROM YOUR FATHER ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO NOW
APART FROM THE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD ONES THAT ARE KEPT AND WE SELL THOSE FOR BREEDING
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
I'M TALKING ABOUT WILLIAM MORRIS
THE MORRIS EIGHT AND
WHATEVER IT WAS
OXFORDSHIRE STAKES GOOD CLAIM TO BEING THE MOST COMPETITIVE COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY
IT'S A SPORT THAT IS ALL THE RAGE IN OXFORDSHIRE AND VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN IN THE REST OF THE WORLD
THERE ARE A MILLION WAYS TO ENJOY OUR GLORIOUS COUNTRYSIDE AND JOHN IS LOOKING BACK AT SOME OF THE
THIRTY MINUTES ON YOUR FIRST COURSE
THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING
IT WASN'T A SMOOTH
IT'S A WILD AND ROMANTIC PLACE WHICH HAS ATTRACTED PEOPLE HERE FOR CENTURIES AND I'M GOING TO BE
RD BLACKMORE CAME HERE TO WRITE LORNA DOONE
HERE'S ELLIE OUT AND ABOUT ON THE SUNNY ISLE OF WIGHT
BUT THAT CAN BRING RISKS WITH IT
HE SHOT HIS MISTRESS'S HUSBAND
THE COUNT OF SHREWSBURY
PAID OVER A MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE HOUSE AND THE ESTATE
GEORGE BER SHAW
BUT SHE SHE REALLY TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN MAKING SURE THAT THE HOUSE WAS ALWAYS ALIVE
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE WORLD AND HIS VERY FAMOUS RICH WIFE OR MISTRESS CAME HERE BUT THERE WAS ONE
AND IT ALL STARTED HERE
CHRISTINE KEELER BECAME A HOUSEHOLD NAME AND CLIVEDEN SECURED ITS PLACE IN HISTORY AS THE
YOUR TEAM'S RECORD IS NOT ALL THAT GOOD
AND WE'LL BE REVEALING THE TWELVE PICTURES THAT WILL STAR IN NEXT YEAR'S COUNTRYFILE CALENDAR
AND PROPERTIES ARE BOUGHT ON A BUYA BEWARE BASIS
OR YOU COULD BE IN FOR SOME NASTY SURPRISES
DID TODAY'S BUYERS GET LUCKY
ITS RIP IT OUT AND START AGAIN BUT
ITS UPSTAIRS AND IT'S HALF DECENT SIZED
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD
IT IS TO DO WITH THE GEOLOGY OF AN AREA AND SOME AREAS HAVE MORE OF IT THAN OTHERS
IT'S EASY TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT
THOUSAND POUND GUIDE PRICE MAY SEEM A BIT OF A BARGAIN
I THINK IT COULD WELL BE
IT NEEDS A BIT OF WORK TO SORT IT OUT
BUT A GOOD SOLID LITTLE PROPERTY AND WE LIKE THAT
LET'S SEE WHO AGREED WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
PURELY FOR THE RETURNS YOU GET IN SOUTH WALES ON THE ON THE PROPERTY
KNOCKING PLASTER OFF THE WALLS
JOHNS CERTAINLY PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A SHREWD OPERATOR IN THE PAST
SELLING HIS PROPERTY PORTFOLIO JUST BEFORE THE CREDIT CRUNCH
HOW WILL HE GET ON SORTING IT OUT HAS HE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION THIS TIME
SO IT'S A HIT WITH STUDENTS TOO
NOW THE QUESTION IS
WILL TODAY'S PROPERTY BE FIRST CLASS OR THIRD RATE
I THINK THAT WOULD WORK WELL FOR MODERN LIVING
RENTING THIS PROPERTY TO THREE OR MORE PEOPLE WOULD MAKE THIS AN HMO
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO YOUR SUMS CAREFULLY REMEMBER THAT STUDENTS PAY ONLY FULL RENT FROM THE END OF
AN HMO REQUIRES FAR MORE IN TERMS OF MANAGEMENT
TIME AND EFFORT
AND THAT IS A BIG BONUS AND SELLING POINT
BUT I THINK THIS ONE COULD RECEIVE FAIRLY HIGH MARKS FROM ME TODAY
CLOSE TO THE UNIVERSITY
RIGHT NEXT TO THE MOTORWAY AS WELL
WE COULDN'T PHONE HIM
SO HE SENT A TEXT
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH HIM
AND BOTH AUDREY AND TIM
THEY'RE DELIGHTED THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO SECURE THIS PROPERTY FOR THEIR SON LUCKY HIM
WITH FIRM IDEAS
AND IN THIS PART OF MANCHESTER
IT'S A REAL HOT SPOT FOR INVESTORS
THIS HOUSE COULD WORK IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND THAT'S WHAT SETS IT APART
LET'S SEE WHO WANTED THIS WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
OFFERS A LOT OF POTENTIAL
DEFINITELY NEEDS SOME RENOVATION
IT'S GOT A NICE FITTED KITCHEN
LOTS OF WORKSPACE
I WOULD MARKET THE PROPERTY AT FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND
CONVERT IT INTO ONE HOUSE OR
I THINK OF COURSE
AT THE MOMENT IT'S DIVIDED INTO TWO FLATS
SO IT LOOKS LIKE OFFICIALLY MAYBE
I WOULD FEEL IF IT WAS LET OUT TO STUDENTS
THEN OBVIOUSLY THE DIFFICULTY IS GOING TO BE IS ITS HIGH MAINTENANCE AND ALSO YOU AGREEMENT LOOKING
WHAT WILL THEY DECIDE
WE COULDN'T PHONE HIM
THOUSAND POUND SO EVEN THE LOWER FIGURE WOULD GIVE YOU TEN
IT'S A NICE FINISH
I WOULD ASK IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE
IF IT WAS A GROWING FAMILY
ESPECIALLY WITH THE FIRST TIME BUYERS
SOME COSMETIC WORK NEEDED TO SORT THIS ONE OUT BUT INTRINSICALLY A GREAT LITTLE PROPERTY
AND A GREAT GUIDE PRICE
LET'S SEE WHO AGREED WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
PROPERTIES CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S FORTUNE FOR BETTER OR WORSE
WHAT INSPIRED THE BUYERS ON TODAY'S SHOW
YOU'VE GOT GOOD BUS ROUTES AND RAILWAY LINKS
IT'S A THREE BEDROOMED EX LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSE
NO STUD PARTITION THERE
AND I WAS WANTING TO BUY A PROPERTY
WHEN IT CAME UP
I DON'T THINK IT'S ADVISABLE TO EXTEND THE PROPERTY
WHAT I WOULD DO IS REFURBISH THE PROPERTY TO A NICE STANDARD
AND THEN RENT IT OUT FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT A YEAR
THEN LOOK AT MAYBE DOING SOME EXTENSIONS ONCE YOU'VE GOT SOME MONEY BACK
YOU SHOULD GET IN THE REGION OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY
THE ADVICE I WOULD GIVE IS TO SPEND AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AND WORK WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE
LET'S SEE WHO FANCIED THIS ONE AS WE GO TO AUCTION
ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT
THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH IN IT
AND A NEW KITCHEN AND A NEW BATHROOM AND THE NEW WINDOWS AND THE NEW BOILER
LEAVE IT AS IT IS
MAYBE JUST TAKE A WALL OUT
AND IT'S A QUESTION EVEN GRAHAM ISN'T PREPARED TO ANSWER
HE'S REALLY GOING TO BE CALLING IN SOME FAVOURS TO ACHIEVE THAT
BUT HE SEEMS CONFIDENT
THEN YOU'VE GOT YOURSELVES A REALLY NICE FAMILY SPACE
THE GUIDE PRICE WAS ONE HUNDRED AND TEN
WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT
SO NO NEED FOR PLANNING PERMISSION
WHICH IS GREAT NEWS
THERE ARE HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS
SO MY ADVICE IS CHECK WITH YOUR LOCAL COUNCIL TO MAKE DOUBLY SURE YOU ARE WITHIN YOUR PERMITTED
POUND SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT
I THINK THEY COULD ACHIEVE BETWEEN NINETY
SO ON THE FACE OF IT
IS THERE A DEMAND FOR IT
SO WE'VE GOT SOME COMMERCIAL THERE
OBVIOUSLY SUBJECT TO PLANNING PERMISSION
AH MOST OF THE ELECTRICS ARE OF TO REGS
AND GENERATING AN INCOME THAT WAS PROBABLY SOMETHING IN THE REGION OF ABOUT FIFTEEN
TIMING IS CRUCIAL
AND NOT LET TIME PASS YOU BY
LET'S SEE HOW TODAY'S BUYERS GOT ON
AND A NEW BATHROOM
IT SHOULD COMMAND A SALE PRICE OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
BUT WE'RE WE'RE SCRAPING AROUND THE SIXTEEN MARK AT THE MOMENT
WHICH WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH
KITCHENS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND
THERE'S NOT THE MONEY THERE FOR A CONSERVATORY
SO WE LEFT THAT
GOOD RANGE OF SOS
THE WAY THE MARKET IS AT THE MOMENT
AND I WOULD SUGGEST PROBABLY MARKETING JUST UNDER THE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY
SO WE'VE GOT SOME COMMERCIAL THERE
WE WANTED TO CREATE
THE GROUND FLOOR SHOP OBVIOUSLY STILL NEEDS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF WORK DOING BEFORE THAT'S GOING TO BE
WHICH IS THE TWO BEDROOM
THE LOCATION AND WHAT IT CAN BE USED FOR
WE'VE ENJOYED IT
BUT ALSO IT CAN BE QUITE STRESSFUL
IT ALL HAPPENS SO QUICK
SO IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON BUYING AT AUCTION
JUST MAKE SURE YOU'RE PREPARED
TODAY I'M IN THE NORTHEAST OF ENGLAND UNDERNEATH THE WINGS OF ANTONY GORMLEY'S FAMOUS SCULPTURE
ONCE A CONTROVERSIAL WORK OF ART
TWENTY METRES TALL WITH A WINGSPAN OF FIFTY FOUR METRES AND SEEN BY AN ESTIMATED
NOT A BAD START
SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT WE'LL FIND WHEN WE DO THAT
OR MAYBE BUILD UP A PORTFOLIO
A LESSON IN HOW NOT TO BUY PROPERTY
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO SMILE
IT'S CERTAINLY MOVED ON IN THE LAST ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE YEARS
ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE NICE AND I WOULD HAVE MADE A GRAND ENTRANCE TODAY
AND IT'S JUST TEN MINUTES FROM LONDON BRIDGE
ONE THING THIS HOUSE DOESN'T LACK IS SPACE
BIT DISAPPOINTING WITH THE STORAGE HEATERS
HERE HAVE A LITTLE ROOM HERE
I'D LIKE TO SEE THE ORIGINAL WINDOWS BE REINSTATED HERE BECAUSE THEN I THINK THE HOUSE WOULD HAVE
OPEN THIS SPACE UP
NOW THIS GARDEN IS NOT ANY OLD GARDEN
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY GRASS
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY THAT ATTRACTIVE AND IT'S QUITE SCRATCHY UNDERFOOT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SHOES
AND IT SHOULDN'T BE
A GARDEN CAN BE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE HOUSE WHEN IT COMES TO SECURING A BUYER OR A TENANT
THIS COULD BE THE DEAL MAKER
BUT LEAVE THINGS AS THEY ARE AND IT COULD BECOME A DEAL BREAKER
I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU MARKET THE PROPERTY AT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY
LET'S FIND OUT WHO WANTED THIS OPPORTUNITY WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
IT WAS QUITE CLOSE TO MY UPPER LIMIT
SO I DECIDED TO BUY ANOTHER PLACE AT AUCTION
AFTER MY EXPERIENCE FROM THE LAST ONE
DEVELOP A PROPERTY
GO OFF EXPLORING THE WORLD
WILL HE DO IT IN THREE MONTHS FOR TWENTY THOUSAND
I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT
INTRINSICALLY THIS IS A FANTASTIC HOUSE
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE RENTING IT OUT LESS THAN THE FOUR FIFTY
I STILL HAVEN'T COME TO THE DECISION WHETHER I WANT TO RENT OR SELL YET
IT WAS JUST GETTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN TO DO THE RIGHT JOBS IN THE TIMESCALE THAT I WANTED TO HAVE
SO I'M QUITE HAPPY WITH THAT
I'VE KEPT IT BELOW THE TEN
THE CHANGES ARE PHENOMENAL IN THIS HOUSE
SHOULD BUILT FIRST TIME BUYERS
BUT OBVIOUSLY SHE'S DONE WHAT SHE COULD WITH WHAT SHE HAS AND
I WOULD EXPECT TO ACHIEVE APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A PARTLY COMPLETED PROJECT
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THIS PLACE
EITHER A FLAT OR A HOUSE
REALLY CAREFUL WITH THE BUDGET
THERE'S NO DENYING THAT GUIDE PRICE IS INCREDIBLY LOW
BUT DOES IT MAKE THIS PROPERTY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY
BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS
SO I KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE OTHER PROPERTY
WE HADN'T EVEN LOOKED AT THE LEGAL PACK ON THIS
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT
MAKING THE CORRECT DECISIONS WHEN IT COMES TO DESIGN ISN'T JUST ABOUT SAY
LIVING WITH THE WRONG PAINT COLOUR FOR A FEW YEARS
BUT HAVE OUR BUYERS GOT IT RIGHT
LET'S SEE WHAT THEY'RE UP TO
I THINK IT WOULD ACHIEVE AROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND
THE MAIN REASON WAS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A SPACIOUS LOUNGE UPSTAIRS
I DIDN'T DO TOO MUCH
BEFORE THEIR SPEECH IS HAMPERED BY THE SNORKELS
I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY MY AH MY WIFE'S TEAM
KEEP THAT IN MIND AS I TELL YOU THAT TONIGHT
IN A VERY SPECIAL EPISODE OF ONLY CONNECT
WILL BE TAKING ON A TEAM OF ROARING KILLERS FROM THE WOODS OF MASTERMIND
I THINK THEY'RE THINGS THAT THEIR NAME CAME FROM LOSING THE FIRST LETTER
AND I THINK IT'S THE QUALITY OF CHESS MOVES IN COMMENTARY
EGYPT WAS BOUTROS BOUTROSALLI
HIARY AND TRINITY
I SHOULD KNOW THIS FOR DEFINITE
IF YOUR FINGERS ARE ITCHY AND YOU NEED TO BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME WELL
I WISH I WAS TWELVE BUT THE WALL IS GOING LIVE ONLINE AS THE TEAMS PLAY IT
THEY'VE NEVER PLAYED THIS BEFORE
LET'S HOPE THEY AREN'T TOO FLUMMOXED BY IT
RIGHT AT THE END OF THE TWO RONNIES
THAT IS THE END OF THE QUIZ
AND IN A VERY CHALLENGING SPECIAL
AS THE DAMP CORPSES OF THREE EVISCERATED BEARS BU GENTLY TOWARDS THE
I'M OFF FOR A PICNIC ON THE BEACH
I'VE GOT THE BEER
I'VE GOT THE WINE
THINK YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO BE NICE ABOUT
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO
HOW ARE THE BAKERS GOING TO SURVIVE THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE
THE BAKE WAS EVEN
MOST OF THE TIME
FOR THE GOVERNMENT
ACROSS THE WORLD OVER THE YEARS
EIGHT BILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VACCINATED AGAINST TB
WHO HAVE NOW SET OUT VERY CLEARLY THE KIND OF EXAM QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS BEFORE WE WILL
IF YOU VACCINATE A DAIRY COW
IS THE MILK SAFE TO DRINK
WHAT ABOUT THE SAFETY OF EATING THE MEAT
ON ITS OWN IT CAN'T RESOLVE THE PROBLEM
I THINK VACCINES WILL WORK A LOT BETTER ONCE WE GET DOWN TO A LOWER LEVEL OF
THE CHAIR OF OUR JUDGING PANEL
GOING BACK WELL OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS
WE DO PAY ATTENTION AND WE TAKE OUR JOBS VERY
AND WE'RE NOT EASILY FOOLED BY CHEAP SCAMS LIKE THIS
BUT BEFORE WE GO
FOR ALL OF YOU THAT ARE EAGER TO VOTE FOR THE WINNER OF THIS YEAR'S COUNTRYFILE PHOTOGRAPHIC
IN ARCHITECTURAL TERMS
DON'T FORGET ME
THESE ARE MY WORDS
BUT THEY SOON CAME TO DOMINATE GREAT SWATHES OF OUR NATION
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY ALIEN TO THE REST OF LONDON LONDON
LONDON WAS A MEDIEVAL CITY
DRAMATICALLY BACKLIGHTS THE PREACHER
AND PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE ON THIS SIDE OF THE CHAPEL
ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE STILL PRESENT
SECURING THE PREMISES
AND ALTHOUGH IT IS A LABOUR OF LOVE
BECAUSE WE DO LOVE THE PROPERTY
AND PEOPLE CAME FROM ALL OVER WALES
THEY GAVE MONEY TO IT BECAUSE THEY WANTED THE WORKERS TO GO TO CHAPEL
I DON'T THINK WE'D EVER QUIT
PARTLY A HANGOVER FROM WHEN THEY HAD TO WORSHIP IN SECRET
AND IT'S ALSO SO EVOCATIVE OF A TIME WHEN
I THINK NEBO HAS ENOUGH TO SUGGEST THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF THIS STUFF
IT'S A KIND OF HERALD
IT'S A STRANGE EFFECT
THERE'S ALMOST TWO FACES TO THIS BUILDING
BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS KIND OF THE BLUEPRINT
HE WAS SO POPULAR
THE REBUILT NEBO CHAPEL
THE MORE CHIMNEYS
AND HERE AT BURLEY
WHICH IS ALL KINDS OF WOODS THAT YOU CAN SORT OF WEAVE TOGETHER LIKE THAT
TO MAKE IT NICE AND STRONG ALL THE WAY ALONG
AND SENT BACK HOME
SCHOOLS WERE SET UP FOR THE POOR
AND AS LONG AS A FAMILY COULD AFFORD FOR THEM NOT TO WORK AT HOME
BOYS STARTED GOING TO SCHOOL
PARTLY BECAUSE THE POPULATION WASN'T GROWING SO FAST AND THE WORKERS COULD CHARGE MORE FOR THEIR
INTO THIS BIG HALL
IN THE GREAT ROOM
WHEN THE DEER WAS BROUGHT DOWN
AND IN HIS EXCITEMENT
SLIT THE DEER'S THROAT
CUT OPEN ITS BELLY AND CLIMBED INSIDE THE DEER
THE RELIGIOUS REVOLUTIONARIES WERE ON THE MARCH AGAIN THIS TIME
VOWING TO TURN THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN
BUT THAT REALLY IS GOOD
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MARY AND PAUL HAVE GOT IN STORE FOR THE BAKERS BUT
IT USED TO BE THE EXCLUSIVE PRESERVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
MANY OF US HAVE ENJOYED THE POWER OF THE SUN THIS SUMMER
I'LL BE INVESTIGATING THE STATE OF SOLAR
FARMERS ACROSS THE LAND HAVE STARTED TO HARVEST A NEW TYPE OF CROP SUNSHINE
BUT IS THE GROWTH OF THE SOLAR FARM A GOOD USE OF OUR LAND
IN RECENT YEARS
WE'RE QUITE NEAR THE COAST IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY
WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT RENT AND THAT SORT OF THING
TWO MILLION POUNDS PER MEGAWATT
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR
IT'LL BE ROUGHLY THREE TIMES THAT
ANOTHER WAY OF GENERATING LARGE AMOUNTS OF SOLAR POWER INSTEAD OF COVERING UP BITS OF OUR FIELDS
WHY NOT PUT THEM ON OUR ROOFS
MILLIONS OF THEM REMAIN VACANT
COUNTRYFI CHALLENGE THE NATURAL HISTORY CAMERAMAN RICHARD TAYLOR JONES TO FILM ONLY THE WILDLIFE
THERE ARE PERCHES EVERYWHERE
THERE ARE LAKES OVER THERE
THAT WAS JUST FANTASTIC
LAST YEAR JUST ONE THIRD OF ONE PERCENT OF OUR ELECTRICITY CAME FROM SOLAR
AND THESE PANELS WERE FITTED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
SINCE WHEN THEY'VE BEEN HAPPILY GENERATING ELECTRICITY
GUARANTEED FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS
BUT EVER SINCE THEN THE RATE'S BEEN DECREASING
WE FEEL REALLY CONFIDENT
BUT WE FEEL REALLY CONFIDENT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING AND
ESPECIALLY TOWARDS THE END OF THIS DECADE
REALLY WITHOUT SUBSIDY
IT'S PRETTY CRISP AND I'D GUESS IT'S READY TO GO
LIKE GRAVY AND SAUCES
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
AND IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT NOT JUST BRINGING IN THE WHEAT BUT
BUT FRUIT AND VEG
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO VOTE FOR THE WINNER OF THIS YEAR'S PHOTOGRAPHIC COMPETITION
YOU ONLY HAVE UNTIL MIDNIGHT
THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT TIME FOR FROM ST

THE SHOW AND A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
I'M FIFTY NINE AND I'M A COMMUNITY EDUCATION WORKER
BECAUSE IT'S SITUATED BETWEEN TWO GRAVEYARDS
THAT HAD A UK TOP TEN SINGLE IN NINETY NINETY FIVE WITH TURN ON
THE DATE IS RIGHT FOR JOHN CAGE
BUT IT MIGHT ALSO BE RIGHT FOR SAMUEL BARBER
BUT I'M GOING TO GO FOR JOHN CAGE BECAUSE I KNOW HE DID COMPOSE MUSIC FOR PIANO
ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO REVERSE MY LOGIC
MY GUESS WOULD BE RIGA
ON THE SOUTHERN BANK OF THE SEINE
SO IT MUST BE CANADA
I GUESS MY FAVORITES ARE OLD
VOICED BY SINGER LOUIS PRIMA IS A CHARACTER IN WHICH DISNEY
I REMEMBER THE SONG
USUALLY JOINED IN WITH BY THE STUDIO AUDIENCE
AND HE WAS CYRUS THE VIRUS
PLAYED BY ROBERT LINDSAY
WHAT PHRASE DID ED MILIBAND USE REPEATEDLY TO OUTLINE HIS VISION OF BRITAIN UNDER A LABOUR
AND YOU'VE GOT IT RIGHT
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
THOUSAND POUNDS SAYS THEY DON'T
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
I'M FIFTY ONE YEARS OLD AND I'M AN ELECTRONICS DESIGN ENGINEER
I'M FIFTY SIX YEARS OF AGE AND I'M A COMPANY DIRECTOR
COURSE SO YOU WON'T KNOW THIS
BUT WITH A FAMOUS STAR EGG
IN WHICH THE FORCES OF ADMIRAL NELSON DEFEATED THE FRENCH FLEET OFF THE COAST OF NORTH AFRICA
SO ENGLISH CHANNEL
IT'S IN SAUDI ARABIA
AND THE MARIANAS IN ITSELF IS A SPANISH NAME
RINGS SOME SORT OF BELL
I KNOW THIS ONE
AND I THINK I REMEMBER SEEING IT THERE
SO I'LL GO FOR THAT ONE
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND WHICH
TOURISM AND IMMIGRATION
USE VEGETABLE STOCK
AND THIS IS A FRESH BATCH
FRUITS AND BERRIES
WITH HIS BROTHER IN LAW
WAS TO BRING MORE OF THIS FAMILY ACROSS
AND AND WHO WERE TRAVELLING ON HOLIDAY TO ITALY
OR EVEN SOME SQUID
AND COMING BACK
IT WASN'T REALLY THE THE THE CHARACTER OF THE DISHES THAT CAME OUT
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
I THINK I'LL PLUMP FOR TURIN
MY INSTANT THOUGHT WAS CAPILLARY BUT
THIS LAST HEAD TO HEAD WILL DECIDE THAT
JUST BECAUSE OF OUR TEAM NAME
TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
AND IT JUST BECOMES THIS LOVELY
THEY DOUBLED A BIT WITH PASTRY
WHICH STILL EXISTS TODAY
BUT IT'S REALLY WORTH IT
IF YOU FANCY A WEEKEND IN THE KITCHEN
YOU CAN NEVER TELL IT
ALL DEPENDS ON THE WEATHER
IT'S ALL AS BRITISH WELL
AND THE WAY THAT WE DO THAT IS
WE'RE PROUD OF IT
WE'VE MADE PIES SINCE THE MIDDLE AGES
FOUR MORE CONTENDERS WILL PUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO THE TEST AND TAKE THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS THE GRAND
PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
THANKS FOR WATCHING
PREVIOUSLY IN MY LIFE
THE GIRLS ALWAYS UNDERESTIMATE ME
SO IF HE COMES BACK IN
A I WANT TO BE THE WOMAN WHO CAN MANAGE A TRICKY SOCIAL OCCASION
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
QUICKLY INTERRUPT THEM
NOT THAT I WAS AS LUCKY WITH MY WORKMEN
THIS IS NOW IN UNCOMFORTABLE TERRITORY
YOU KNEW THE ALLURE WASN'T WORKING
HE WAS ABOUT TO PICK ME
SINCE GARY WAS MAJESTIC IN THE PARK
I'VE DECIDED I'M GOING TO BRAVE IT
AND STOP HIM FROM LEAVING
SO I'M GOING TO PEN THE PERFECT ROMANTIC SPEECH
I'D MAKE A FOOL OF MYSELF BECAUSE I'D SAY THAT I' MISS COMING IN TO THE RESTAURANT EVERY MORNING
NOT BECAUSE OF THE CAKES
AND I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR ALL ABOUT IT
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
AND THE VISITORS
IT WHAT CARIBBEAN FOOD IS ABOUT
IT'S DELICIOUS AND MOST OF ALL
YOU WOULD THINK HE IS A VERY WITTY
THERE WAS NO BOMBAST ABOUT HIM NO
WE TAKE EXCEPTION MOST STRONGLY TO SOME OF THE DULAN AND SUGGESTIVE DIALOGUE IN BBC PLAYS
IT WAS DIFFERENT
AND IT WAS TOPICAL AS WELL
RONNIE CORBETT AMONGST OTHERS
THERE THAT IMAGE IS PROJECTED UP ON THE SCREEN
BECAUSE IT CAPTURES THAT IDEA OF SOCIAL MOBILITY
EVERY TIME YOU SEE A TV DOCUMENTARY THAT REFERS TO THE IDEA OF CLASS OR AH OR A NEWSNIGHT DISCUSSION
I RESPECTED WHY I DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE
GERALD WILEY BEGAN TO TAKE IDEAS FROM OTHER WRITERS AND USE THEM FOR HIMSELF
THE FAMOUS SKETCH WITH THE SPOONERISMS IN IT
NOT ORIGINATED BY RONNIE BARKER OR GERALD WILEY
THE FIRST ONE WAS NOT WRITTEN BY HIM
BUT ALL THE SUBSEQUENT OTHERS WERE
AND I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS
WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT
WELL IT'S DURING THE SCHOOL HOLIDAY
WHOM I DIDN'T LIKE VERY MUCH AS A PERSON
YOU CAN REHEARSE DURING THE DAY AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU THE WEEKEND OFF
BUT IT WAS ALL THERE
HE WOULD NOT USE CHARLIE CRICHTON
AND THE WORST OF THE LOT WAS YOU GOT TO HAVE A PUNCHLINE
AND IT HAD RONNIE BARKER
AND THEN AT THE VERY END NOBODY KNEW WE WERE ALL TAKING BETS WHO IT WAS
HE IS TOO GOOD AT WRITING
THERE WAS A LOT OF POLITICS LONDON WEEKEND DAVID FROST
AND THEY SIGNED THE TWO RONNIE SO
SO ITV HAD THE TWO RONIE
IN THE SAME WAY THE BBC HAD STANLEY BAXTER
APART FROM ANYTHING ELSE
AND THERE WAS SOME POLITICS THAT WENT ON
GUESSING PEOPLE'S NAMES
THE RHYTHM OF THEIR PERFORMANCES TOGETHER
THERES A SORT OF EASE ABOUT THE WAY THEY WORK WITH EACH OTHER WHEN THEY' ARE SITTING OUT AS
IN A VERY VERY STRAIGHT
ALWAYS MADE HIM FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE
UM AND YET IN CONVERSATION AND AS HIMSELF HE WAS JUST SUPREMELY FUNNY
MAYBE EVEN THE WORLD
WHICH WAS JUST MARVELLOUS TO BEHOLD
HE HAD SUCH A GOOD EAR FOR THESE THINGS
HE KNEW HOW TO KIND OF HOW TO KIND OF COPY THE RHYTHMS OF THE SERMON OR THE PUBLIC INFORMATION FILM
AND IT WAS VERY FUNNY
OH THAT WAS JUST A BIT OF FRIENDLY ADVICE
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD REALLY READ IT OUT
IT'S THE WEATHER
I HAVE THIS FROM JOHN LLOYD WHO PRODUCED THE SKETCH
IT IS HARD TO SEE YOURSELF AS OTHERS SEE YOU AND I'M SURE
I THINK HE REALISED LATER THAT IT WAS LEGITIMATE AND FUN BUT
BUT PROBABLY HE FELT THREATENED
I THINK EVERYBODY FEELS THREATENED IN SHOW BUSINESS
THERE'S RONNIE BARKER
AND I WAS WITH STEPHEN FRY AND WE SORT OF EDGED INTO HIS ORBIT BECAUSE WE WERE BOTH EXTREMELY STARSTRUCK
THERE REALLY WAS
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYBODY ELSE AS HE
BUT I'M GOING TO RETIRE
AND I JUST WANT TO PLAN THE NEXT YEAR
THIS IS WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO
CAN WE JUST PLAN IT NOW
THEN I'VE GOT THAT BANKED IN MY MIND AND THEN THAT'S IT
FAMILY CAME FIRST
THEATRE CAME NEXT
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WHEN HE EVENTUALLY RETIRED
I DON'T HONESTLY THINK IT WORRIED HIM
THE REST OF US OLD TROOPERS GO ON AS LONG AS WE POSSIBLY CAN BUT
BUT HE'D DONE EVERYTHING HE WANTED TO DO
BECAUSE IT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE IT'S MORE DIFFICULT
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HOT
AND YOU'VE GOT LIGHTS AS WELL AND
SHARING A SENSE OF HUMOUR
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO WAS AS GOOD AS HE WAS
WHEN HE WAS ROBBED OF REALLY GOOD WRITING
EITHER HIS WRITING OR SOMEBODY ELSE'S WRITING
ABOUT THOSE LATE SITCOM VEHICLES
UM EVERYBODY LOVED YOU
AND THEN COMES THE NEXT PHASE
AS DID HAPPEN WITH RONNIE BARKER
I WISH HE HADN'T RETIRED AND I THINK IF HE HAD DECIDED TO JUST REDUCE HIS WORKLOAD AND KEEP GOING
AND HE WAS DETERMINED THAT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM AND TOMMY COOPER HAD GONE AROUND THAT TIME
RONNIE HAD RETIRED
MANY I THINK FOUR OR FIVE AT LEAST
WHICH I'VE HEARD IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL GUN
I'VE STOPPED JUST TO TAKE AN OVERVIEW BECAUSE
I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT AND I SUSPECT OFTEN SAID THAT
BRINGING PLANTS AND ROCKS IN
THERE IS LITERALLY EVERYTHING TO PLAY FOR
WHEN PAUL AND MARY GET TRIGGER HAPPY ANYONE'S FAIR GAME
I'M GOING TO LEAVE BEFORE THEY FIRE ME
ITS ORIGINS ARE WAY MORE ILLUSTRIOUS
HIS RECIPE RECORDED FOR POSTERITY BY ROYAL CHEFS IN BRITAIN'S OLDEST COOKERY BOOK
I KNEW IF I GOT IT WRONG
AND I KNEW IF I DID ALL RIGHT
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN
ALL THAT CHANGED
THE EXPLOSION AND
BUT THEY ARE HERE
WHICH WAS JUST FANTASTIC
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS
THAT'S THE RULE OF THUMB
BUT IN A REAL LIFE ENVIRONMENT
PEOPLE JUST LOVE IT
BUT BEFORE THAT
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
AND AS FOR THE WRINKLES
HAVE BEEN APPOINTED RATHER THAN ELECTED TO GOVERN
I DON'T BELIEVE
AND SHE MUST BE THE RIGHT ONE
I MADE AN EFFORT NOT TO SEE THESE FILMS
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
AND I A FINANCIAL CRIME PREVENTION SENIOR MANAGER
ARE YOU READY FOR THE QUIZ
I DON'T THINK KIBERLY SANDE'S HADED SECOND ALBUM YET
I WENT TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME
WHILE I HAVE THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE AT HOME ON A BOOKSHELF
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY READ THEM
I'M GOING TO GO FOR ZADIE SMITH
MARRIED THE ACTRESS MILDRED DAVIS IN
THOUSAND PO SAYS THEY DON'T
THE POWER BROKERS OF THEIR AGE
AND THE POTS THEY MADE WERE FAIRLY CRUDE
THIS HORSEBACK BREAKER
A WORD USED BY SHAKESPEARE ONLY
AND IT WASN'T JUST TRADE
HE'S GOT THE MONEY
WERE FOUND IN DOORWAYS
LEFT ABANDONED BY THEIR MOTHERS
SO MUCH SO THAT IN THE EARLY DAYS
THEY DEVISED A BALLOT SYSTEM TO DECIDE WHICH CHILDREN TO TAKE
AND THIS WAS A DEVICE SO HE COULD EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF LIGHT
TO SHOW HIS FRIENDS
THE PRINCIPLE'S VERY SIMPLE
THE SHOW AND A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
PO ON OUR LOCAL RADIO SHOW
VANAI IS A SACRED CITY TO THE HINDUS
IT'S NOT A QUOTE THAT
NEVADA AND CALIFORNIA
THE NAME MR BENTON
I ASK EACH TEAM THREE QUESTIONS IN TURN
THEY HADN'T YET BEEN DISCOVERED
EVEN UNDER WILLIAM PENN
THAT'S TO SAY IT WAS REPRODUCED AND HUNG IN HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN HOMES
FOUGHT THEM ALL THE TIME
WHERE IT WAS PUT ON DISPLAY
IF WE DIDN'T WANT INDIA TO GO THE SAME WAY AS AMERICA
HE ACTUALLY THOUGHT OF THE INDIAN PEOPLE AS DEPRAVED
AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE JUST THE LEADER OF A GREAT TRADING COMPANY
HE ACTUALLY WANTED TO BE A RULER
THE BRITISH WERE WONDERING HOW TO DEVELOP THEIR EMPIRE
AND THEY CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
WITH THE MACHINE GUN JAMMED
THE COLONEL DEAD
THE LINE BROKEN
AND A VOICE IS HEARD RALLYING THE TROOPS WITH THAT SCHOOLBOY CRY
BY HENRY NEWBOLT A POEM THAT EVERY SCHOOLBOY WOULD HAVE LEARNT
IT BEGINS WITH THE CAPTAIN OF THE TEAM
PLAY UP AND PLAY THE GAME
AND THEN THE SCENE MOVES TO A BATTLEFIELD IN AFRICA
WITH THE DESERT SAND SODDEN WITH BLOOD
AH COVERING HIMSELF IN GREAT GLORY
MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE OF WALKING GORDON'S NOSE
WITH ALL THAT FORCE THAT CAME BACK FROM AH WHEN YOU FIRE A RIFLE
AND YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE A WHOLE
IN THE MAXIM GUN
IT'S CLEARLY QUEEN VICTORIA
SHE NEVER WENT ON A STATE VISIT TO AFRICA
WORLD WAR WAS LOOMING
AND WITHIN DECADES
THOSE COUNTRIES THAT BRITAIN HAD THOUGHT OF AS HER OVERSEAS POSSESSIONS WERE STARTING TO
REALISTICALLY WE COULDN'T STICK WITH THEM DURING THE WINTER UP HERE IN THE ARCTIC
THE TRAIN IS FAR TOO HARSH
UM BUT SHE LITERALLY POPPED UP
FROM THE BIG POLAR BEARS
BIG AND BEAUTIFUL POAN
IT WAS TWENTY FOUR HOUR DAYLIGHT
NIGHT HAS ARRIVED IN THE ARCTIC
THE SHOW AND A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
I'M SIXTY SIX YEARS OLD AND I'M A RETIRED CHEMICAL WORKS MANAGER
I'M THIRTY SIX YEARS OLD AND I'M A RETAIL MANAGER
LET'S HAVE A GO AT IT
I'M FIFTY SEVEN AND I'M A RETIRED PHARMACEUTICAL PLANT MANAGER
ALSO KNOWN AS THE MUSTA DOME
I'VE BEEN TO CYPRUS
BEGINS WITH THE CENTRAL CHARACTER
I'VE NO IDEA WHATSOEVER
CERTAINLY BEFORE MY CONSCIOUS TIME
SO THAT'S MY ANSWER
THOUSAND POUNDS SAYS THEY DON'T
AND BEYOND THAT YOU KNOW
TWO HUNDRED DEGREES CELSIUS
WE WERE SENDING ONE
WHITSTABLE WAS VERY
IN TIMES OF PLENTY
YOUR TASTE BUDS ARE INTENSE
WHAT A VERITABLE THRILL TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN
NOW LET ME GET YOU UP TO SPEED
PREVIOUSLY IN MY LIFE
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SLEEPING ON A LILO BECAUSE MY BED BROKE
MEAN WHO NEEDS THREE DORIS
I'M STARTING NOW
REALLY ENJOYING LIFE OUT HERE SO FAR
PLANS ALL A BIT UP IN THE AIR
AND ASKS A WOMAN OUT ON THEIR FIRST NIGHT
THEY MUST ACCEPT
WHERE EVERY WEEK BUDDING ENTREPRENEURS PITCH THEIR BUSINESS IDEAS TO FIVE SELFADE
WHO HAVE TO DECIDE WHERE TO INVEST THEIR MONEY
COMBINED WITH THE STRINGENT ENFORCEMENT OF THE DRINK DRIVING LAWS
MY NAME IS JOHN MCFARLANE
WITH ME TODAY IS MY BUSINESS PARTNER
VERY RARELY NOW
I THINK YOU WOULD BE
I'VE GOT TO SAY
BUT IF IT'S TRICKY TO COME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA IN THE YOUNG
THAT'S WHAT OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEURS ARE TRYING TO DO
THE PLAN YOU SHOULD BE CONSIDERING NOW IS
WHEN I PROPOSED TO MY GIRLFRIEND
I FOUND THE EXPERIENCE OF BUYING AN ENGAGEMENT RING VERY FRUSTRATING
SO WE OFFER THIS THING CALLED A PROPOSAL SERVICE
OR TO PROPOSE WITHOUT A RING AND THEN SAY
THEY ARE THIS AND THIS IS WHY I'M BETTER
BUT THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS AND THEY HAVE THE FACILITY TO DO IT
SOME OF THE BIG DESIGNER NAMES ON THE HIGH STREET STARTED LIFE ON A UNIVERSITY CAMPUS
AND OUR NEXT ON TREND ENTREPRENEURS
TOM CARSON AND CHRIS REA
WE THEN STARTED MAKING CUSTOM ONESIES FOR SPORTS GROUPS AND TEAMS
MY NAME'S CHRIS
THE JACK WILLS STYLE WAS VERY BIG ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES
YOUNG ONES IS A NEW CLOTHING BRAND THAT'S RAPIDLY EMERGING ACROSS UNIVERSITIES IN THE UK
I THINK THAT WE'VE WE'VE SEEN THEIR MODEL AND WE'VE SEEN IT WORK
WE WE WE'RE NOT DESIGNERS
YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR OWN BRAND IDENTITY
WE'VE HAD REVENUE OF SEVENTY SIX
BUT I DO WISH YOU LUCK
AFTER YOU GET YOUR INVESTMENT BACK
CHRIS AND TOM WON AN INVESTMENT FROM DUNCAN BANNNAINE
IF THEY CAN MAKE THEIR BUSINESS FLY
MAYBE THEY CAN SET A TREND AMONG STUDENTS
BUT THAT BRINGS PROCEEDINGS IN THE DEN TO A CLOSE FOR ANOTHER SERIES
OUR SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS NOW GET DOWN TO BUSINESS AND THE DEN WILL GET BACK TO BUSINESS BEFORE LONG
I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM TRY
I HAVE A LONG STANDING ARRANGEMENT WITH THE VICAR
AND HAVE IT BACK HERE IN TIME FOR THE AIR RAID PRACTICE ON SATURDAY
IT WAS A SORT OF KIND OF THEME PARK
REINFORCES TO ME
THEY COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND OUR LOVE FOR THE PAST
IS ACTUALLY NOT JUST TO DO WITH THE WHITE
IT'S GOING ON QUITE WELL
CUT WHAT THEY CAN AND THEN MOVE ON
THAT GARDEN WAS CREATED AS PART OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS TOWARDS PAINTING
IF THERE'S A GARDEN THAT YOU'VE BEEN DYING TO SEE FOR A LONG TIME
AND YOU UNDERSTAND IT AND YOU APPRECIATE IT
AND WHAT REALLY SEEMS TO BE SPECIAL ABOUT IT
WHAT YOU HAVE HERE AT HETLOW IS THE MOULD THAT FORTY YEARS LATER
THEY WANT TO TRY TO
PERPETUAL DARK IN THE WINTER
BUT THE MINUTE THEY STEP OUT OF THE DOOR
BUT NOT ANY MORE
IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
IT'S BEING SCARED AWAY BY A MORE DOMESTIC PREDATOR
THAT'S TWENTY MILLION ANIMALS AND BIRDS THAT ARE KILLED EACH AND EVERY YEAR
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THE POPULATION OF HOUSE SPARROWS IS PRODUCING AROUND ABOUT SIXTEEN MILLION
YOU CAN INTERPRET IT IN THAT WAY
I THINK OUR STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL MAKING THOSE KIND OF
BUT THIS STUFF IS REALLY QUITE SOMETHING
EXPENSIVE AND COMPLICATED
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE ON A BUDGET
AND THAT IS WHEN YOU'VE ENJOYED LOOKING OR PHOTOGRAPHING ANIMALS
AND YOU CAN DO THAT WITH ALL SORTS OF CAMERAS
THE OWNERS INFORMED
WHICH ARE VERY ACTIVE OVERNIGHT
BIRDS ARE MOST ACTIVE AT DAWN AND DUSK
SOME NESTING SITES
IF YOU HAVE A SYLVESTER NEARBY WITH AN UNQUENCHABLE APPETITE FOR THEWEY PIES IN
THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT THEM
I'VE GOT TO GO AND CATCH UP WITH MATT
AND I WILL BE CELEBRATING A SHEEP THAT IS BACK FROM THE BRINK
THE SHOW AT A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
MARRIED TONY BLAIR
AND I' GOING TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON
BUT IT'S JUST LIKE A SEA OF PEOPLE AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT BUT
I NEGOTIATE MILLION DOLLAR DEALS FOR BREAKFAST
AND WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO STAY IN A FIVE STAR HOTEL WHERE IT WAS LIKE ALL INCLUSIVE AND
GOLDEN CHANAU MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF FLOWER
WE DO GET A BIT OF THAT
AND WE TRAVEL IN A VAN ALL THE TIME
ESPECIALLY FOR ME
BUT I DO MY BEST TO BOTH AND THE GUYSANG LIKE THE PLAYERS
CROSSED THE LINE
HIGH INTO THE AIR
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND WHICH IS
WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ TEAM IN
WHO IN TWENTY TWELVE BECAME THE FIRST NATIVE AMERICAN WOMAN TO BE CANONISED
THE SHEFFIELD DAR
DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S KABUL
THAT'S OUR PERMIT
ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT ARE ARE HEAVILY THREATENED AND WE FEAR WILL BE GONE WITHIN THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS OR SO
IN MY EXPERIENCE
I DID I SAW IT ON THE STAGE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT
I WAS VERY LUCKY THAT
BECAUSE APART FROM THE MPS
I FOLLOW IT VERY VERY CLOSELY
I WOULD IMAGINE
ISN'T THAT RIGHT
MY POOR HUSBAND
WE'RE A LITTLE MORE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH IT
I THINK THAT'S ABOUT ALL WE CAN
AND WHEN THEY REMOVE SHARKS FROM THAT
WHATEVER THEY ARE
WE'VE BEEN QUIZZING FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS IN OUR LOCAL PUB
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMEWHERE
WE PLAY GOLF DOWN THERE QUITE A LOT
IT'S NOT THE TIBER
BUT COULD IT BE MISSISSIPPI
I'M SURE IT'S FOURTEEN
THE DOUBLE AXEL
WITH NOT MUCH CONFIDENCE
BY NORTH BY NORTHWEST
I'LL TRY A PUNT
I USED TO COME ALONG HERE WITH ME FATHER ON MY BICYCLE
IT WERE QUITE AN EXCITING WORLD
IN SEARCH OF OUR INDUSTRIAL PAST
PART OF THE CONTRACT WAS TO JACK THE THING UP AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE BOTTOM AND WHEN WE DID YOU KNOW DIDN'T NEED A BUT
AND THEY REPLACED BY TWO ELECTRIC PUMPS
AND PROTECT ALL THAT LIVE IN OUR GREAT CITY
THEN SOME OTHER POOR
WHAT IF WE WERE TO SNEAK INTO THE CAVES
LEAVE THE WEAPONS FOR JASON
IF WE'D HAVE LEFT THE CITY WHEN I SAID
AND HE COULD SEE THEM
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE PRETENDED IT WAS
EAT WE EAT ALL THE TIME
WHAT WE CAN'T GROW
WHICH LOOKS LIKE A BAD THEME PARK AND AND COULD EASILY PUT YOU OFF
THE FRIENDLY ANIMALS HID
YOU GOT THE MONEY RAISED
AND QUICKLY BECAME ESTABLISHED AS AN INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED GARDEN DESIGNER
I THINK YOU ALWAYS NEED TO HAVE CULTURAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE IN A GARDEN
IN OTHER PLACES
BUT ARE NONNATIVE PLANTS AND ANIMALS REALLY ALL THAT BAD
INVASIVE SPECIES BUT
AND THEY ARE CANNIBALS
IT'S THE FRUITION OF OF THE PROJECT
IT'S DYING BACK PRETTY WELL HERE
WHO WILL BE BATTLING IT OUT TO BECOME THE CHAMPION OF TWENTY THIRTEEN
I AM DELIGHTED THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO BE JOINED BY ANOTHER TV LEGEND
AND SCOTLAND AND WALES
WHAT'S THE ART IN GETTING A DOG TO DO THAT
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING
THAT IS IT FOR THIS WEEK
BUT YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT JULIA'S GOT IN STORE
SOME OF THEM ARE ABOUT FIVE OR SIX METRES
WHICH CAN'T BE CONTROLLED
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
YOU COULD SAY THAT
IT DOES A LITTLE BIT
I'M A SALES REP
SO I VISIT LOTS OF BOOKSHOPS AROUND THE COUNTRY
I DON'T THINK IT'S DAVID
AND THE QUESTIONS ARE ALL GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
AND YOU ARE ALLOWED TO CONFER
I'M TRYING TO THINK BACK BECAUSE I HAVE WATCHED THE CENTER FILM
WHICH IS A GREAT
I'VE HEARD OF THE FILM
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
I'M A WATER RESOURCES ENGINEER
AND I'M A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER
I'M SIXTY ONE YEARS OF AGE AND I'M A CHARTERED TOWN PLANNER
LOOSE IMPEDIMENTS SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE
I KNOW THE FILM WAS FAIRLY RECENT
I THINK I'LL GO
SO I THINK WE'LL STICK WITH GOING SECOND
WHERE I CAN TAKE A BRIEF
THE DIFFERENT USES OF LANGUAGE
I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING OVER ME
DIFFERENT WAYS OF PUTTING THINGS ACROSS
HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING WILL BE OK
I'M TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD
IN BETWEEN WITH RHYTHMS
BUT I'M ORIGINALLY FROM PORTSMOUTH
ELEVEN OR SOMETHING
IF YOU WANT TO HEAR WHERE THEY GOT THAT FROM
THEN THERE'S RELAXATION HERE
WHEREAS IF THEY'RE TIGHT
I THINK IT'S BEGINNING TO DAWN ON HER THAT SHE'S GOT SOMETHING QUITE SPECIAL
UM AND TO BE ABLE TO DO ALL KINDS OF MUSIC I THINK ISN'T SOMETHING THAT HAD PERHAPS OCCURRED TO HER
BALANCING AND KEEPING IT HEALTHY
ISN'T THE WORST WEATHER
BUT FOR WHAT WE'VE GOT IN MIND
CHAR AND CHMAN CHUM
WITH ALL OF OUR EFFORT
I'M SIXTY SIX AND I'M A CARE COMPANY OWNER
I'M SIXTY SEVEN AND I'M A RETIRED SENIOR LECTURER
THAT IS THE LOVELY BEN WISHAW WHO I THINK IS A TERRIBLY GOOD ACTOR
UM YELLOW BROWN WOULDN'T WORK

HELPING THEM ACHIEVE QUALIFICATIONS
BUT WHEN THE CHOICES CAME UP
IT'S OBVIOUSLY EARLY OASIS
I THINK THE FATHER OF THE HOUSE HAS A PRETTY LOW PROFILE
IT IS TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND WHICH
I WILL ASK EACH TEAM THREE QUESTIONS IN TURN
THIS TIME THE QUESTIONS ARE ALL GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
YOU ARE ALLOWED TO CONFER
BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T KNOW I
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LIKE
THE CARPEDIAN MOUNTAINS
WHICH MAKES THE PASTRY REALLY STRETCHY
AND ACCORDING TO THE KENNEL CLUB'S LATEST DATA
AND THEY CAN'T DO IT
SO I SUGGEST TO MY SUPERVISOR TO TEST IT ACROSS SPECIES
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ABOUT
RUTH WENT ON THE TRAIL OF A LEGENDARY DOG WHOSE LOYALTY
AND MAYBE EVEN GRIEF
THERE WAS ONE IN LIVERPOOL
AND SEE IF THEY CAN PICK THEM UP
AND HIS THEORY IS THAT DOG OWNER OR NOT
YOU COULD CERTAINLY IDENTIFY THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BARKS PLAYFUL
CAME OUT AS THE MOST EXTROVERT
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL HIM THAT I'VE GOT TWO VERY SCRUFFY MONGRELS
I'D BE VERY PLEASED
THE FURRY TOP LIP
THEY'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAME
BUT WE SAW COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS
SOME WENT FOR ROAST CHICKEN OR FOOD
WE'VE GOT A TEST TO SEE HOW MUCH VARIATION THERE IS WITHIN A BREED
HAS EACH DOG GOT ITS OWN INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITY
FROM LONDON SOUTH BANK UNIVERSITY
YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK
AND EVEN IF YOU DO HAVE ONE
AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY STARTLING
IT'S A TWO WAY STREET
WHEN WE MEASURE THE SAME HORMONE
WHEN WE INTERACT WITH THEM
IN THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURY
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT HAPPENED
THE FRANKINCENSE WAS THERE
I WAS KEEPING WATCH WHEN I HEARD A SOUND FROM THE FOREST
BATHED IN MOONLIGHT
THEY WERE TO MAKE AN OFFERING OF ME
THIS WAS ANOTHER GIRL
I THINK I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WOMAN AND A MONKEY
IT'S A FIT NOTE BUT
YOU MUST SEE LOTS OF PRETTY GIRLS AT THE CAMPUS
IF THE PATIENT GIVES US A CASE HISTORY
THE DOCTOR SAYS
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF HAVING HIM SECTIONED
BRINGING THEM ALL TOGETHER
DOES IT SET THE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE REST OF THE MEAL QUITE HIGH ENOUGH
SEVENTY FIVE MILES A DAY ON AVERAGE AND WE WENT FROM SAINT MARLO IN THE NORTH
WE READ MATCH MAGAZINE
IS APPLIED TO FOREIGN CRICKETERS WHO PLAY FOR A COUNTY
BUT I MAY BE WRONG THERE
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN HEADING TOWARDS OUR FINAL ROUND
DO I HAVE A MOBILE
I MUST DO BETTER
IF YOU DON'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT IT
YOU YOU LIKE CHRIS
IF IT'S ABOUT SOCIAL SERVICES
MISS AUSTEN HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER EVERYONE
SO I THINK I REMEMBER THIS BEING IN THE NEWS AT THE TIME AND
WELL I HAVEN'T READ IT
TO PUN DOESN'T SOUND TOO LIKELY
IT IS TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
BUT NOT REALLY A VARIETY OF MUSIC
I THINK I'M GO TO HAVE TO GO STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE AND GO FOR THE OPEN UNIVERSITY
I'LL JUST HAVE TO OFFER A COMPLETE GUESS
I'M HERE IN SUB ZERORO TEMPERATURES
I REALLY FEEL HURT ABOUT IT
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT MY METHODS ARE CRUDE
YOU HOUSEWIVES AT HOME WHO SAY TO ME
YOU'RE A FLAMBOYANT CHAP
SORRY ABOUT THAT
LET ME TELL YOU
THESE BEAUTIFUL CORNISH ONES
THE GOOD PARTS OF IT WAS IT DID AWAY WITH THE WORST OF THE EXCESSES OF THE OLD COOKING
THE PEOPLE WHO EAT OUT HAVE CHANGED
AND WHAT THEY DEMAND IS NOW DIFFERENT
BUT IT'S NOT AN INTRUSION
I WOULDN'T LIKE IT EVERY DAY BUT
PICKING UP THE BITS AND PIECES
OUR LITTLE HELICOPTER BRINGING ME HERE
WHEREVER THEY HAVE TORNADOES THESE DAYS
AND PAY ATTENTION
IN FIVE MINUTES
THE ADMIRALS WITH THE FINEST FOODS OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE
AS WE CALL THEM IN THE TRADE
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
AND I'M AN I TECHNICIAN
WE ROLL THE PRIZE MONEY OVER TO THE NEXT SHOW
I DON'T THINK BRADLEY I THINK HE WAS SIGNED TO THE TEAM
LOTS OF MONEY TO PLAY FOR
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HER
IT IS TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
AND I WOULD LIKE THAT FOR MYSELF
YOU KNOW WITH NO RESTRICTIONS
DON'T TALK ABOUT STYLE BUT
AFTER SPENDING FIVE HOURS
SIX HOURS TRAWLING THE INTERNET
AH BARELY A DOUBLE BED
AND ACTUALLY IN THE CASE OF THE KITCHEN
IT'S JUST SO ORIGINAL
WHEN I'M BUSY DOING WORK
AND THE ONLY WAY THEY ARERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IS BY OPENING UP AND ALLOWING THE SPACES TO
SO THE WARM AIR IS TRAPPED
AND WHAT'S MORE
THE DAYS ARE GETTING LONGER
BUT I CAN'T SEE IT FROM HERE BECAUSE IT'S UNDERWATER
ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER
AND WHEN ALL OF THOSE CYCLES REACH THEIR MOST EXTREME POINT ALL AT THE SAME TIME
BUT OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
THE DAYS WILL GET LONGER AND WARMER AND THE SEA ICE WILL BEGIN TO BREAK UP AND RECEDE
AND IF YOU DON'T DO WHAT THEY TELL YOU TO DO
JUST LITTLE BY LITTLE
I'LL DOWNLOAD IT
BUT LET'S FACE FACTS
WHAT'S THIS ALL THIS CREAM
AND ALL THAT BUSINESS
MOST OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FULL OF PRAISE
AND YOU DRINK FAR TOO MUCH
IF YOU ATE LIKE THAT EVERY DAY
UM AND THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER THING ABOUT MY CASUAL ATTITUDE
IT'S JUST FOR FUN
AND IT'S NOT JUST A COOKING PROGRAM MEAN
THIS IS TO INSPIRE YOU AND CHEER YOU UP
AND THEN THEY SAY THINGS LIKE
OTHER PEOPLE SAY
YOU KEEP ABUSING THE BBC PERSONNEL
THEY DO HAVE TO ACTUALLY DO WHAT THEY'RE JONY WELL TOLD
THAT'S ENOUGH LETTERS
HAVE JUST BEEN TOO MANY
BUT THANKS FOR ALL YOUR LOVELY INVITATIONS AND ALL YOUR KIND OFFERS
AND WE ALWAYS COOK IN LEMONADE
STRONG RED WINE
AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO A BIT OF SIMPLE PEASANT COOKING AND SOME RED MEAT
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE VEGETARIANS
BECAUSE THIS PROGRAMME IS REALLY GOING TO UPSET YOU
YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT ME
HAVE THE ANSWER
THEY HAVE SENT ME
FROM THE CAMEROON
SOME PEPPER PASTE
I'VE BEEN HEARING
OR ARE THEY WAX
I'M A BIT SURPRISED I HAVEN'T FOUND ANY CHEDDAR
I HAVEN'T FOUND ANY WEST COUNTRY CHEESE
BELIEVE IT OR NOT DESPITE OUR LITTLE MERRY TIME HERE
AND THEY'VE REALLY COME ON VERY WELL
I BET YOU HAVEN'T
IF YOU LIVE SOMEWHERE NEAR A FARM THAT MAKES IT
THEY WANT YOUR BUSINESS
AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE
THERE'S A VERY SPECIAL THING THAT HAPPENS TO MARGARET'S BREAD
AND THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE USED TO EAT THEIR FOOD FROM BEFORE PLATES WERE INVENTED
AND THIS IS THE LIVING AND
BECAUSE HE WAS THE GUY WHO KEPT THESE WARM WHILST ROAST SPIT ROASTING THE MEAT
PUT IT ON THERE AND YOU HAD A TRENCHER
WHICH BRINGS ME ON TO A LITTLE PET HOBBY OF MINE
WE THINK PIZZAS HAVE ONLY JUST BEEN INVENTED
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHICH HAVE BECOME
THIS IS THE LIVING PROOF OF THE MISTAKE WE AS A NATION AND THE BAKERS OF THE NEW
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BREAD
WHAT IS THIS ONE
AND WE DON'T THINK HOUSEWIVES REALLY WANTED
AND SO I BAKE THESE IN THE FLOWERPOTS
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
PUT THE YOS IN FRONT OF IT
WELL SHE GOES DOWN A RABBIT HOLE
I WOULD PRESUME IT'S THE WHITE RABBIT
WILL GO DOWN THE LEFT
IT'S MORE THAN THAT
BUT I DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE THAT
CHEESE STANDS OUT STRAIGHT AWAY
MEANING EFFICIENT CHIPS
IT'S JUST A GUESS
IT MUST BE GYMNASTICS
COME BACK TO US
I'M NOT SURE IF I AM ACTUALLY QUITE PREPARED FOR WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SEE
FOOD IS COMFORT JESS SATISFIES HER HUNGER
CANADIAN WINTER JACKETS
A CASE OF BOURBON
ONE GUY PLAYED THE SAXOPHONE WITH TOMMY DORSEY BEFORE THE WAR AND HE BROUGHT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THE RECORDS FROM HIS
IT WAS ALL STUFF TO MAKE WARTIME LIFE IN EUROPE THAT LITTLE BIT MORE BEARABLE
WHICH IS WHY MOST OF IT DIDN'T GET THROWN OVERBOARD
THEY CRACKED IT OPEN AS THE PLANE LOST ALTITUDE
ONE OTHER CREW MEMBER BECAME HIGHLY DECORATED BUT TO BAIL OUT OF AN AIRCRAFT AND SPENT TWO
IN THE TUMULTUOUS WARTIME SERVICE OF THESE MEN
SOMETIMES PERHAPS EVEN A WHOLE DAY
RIGHT FROM GENERAL SIR JAMES DA WAS IN CHARGE OF THE PLANS
THE INFANTRY HAD SOME PRETTY HEAVY DUTY SUPPORT
HIS MOTHER CAME FROM NEWMOS
IF IT HAD OPERATED ON NO OTHER DAY THAN THE SIXTH OF JUNE
THE INFANTRY COULD CARRY IT
THIS IS THE MOST HEAVILY DEFENDED CITY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SOME OF THEM DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT
I FLIP THROUGH
I'VE ASKED PEOPLE
NATURAL FACINGS OF MATERIALS
YOU THEY HAVE A QUALITY OF THEIR OWN
WE HAVE SPENT SO FAR ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN
THEY'RE MAKING THEIR OWN PRODUCT
I THINK IT WAS P
YOU WERE HAVING A CRISIS ABOUT LIGHTING
WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THIS SYSTEM
BY LAYERING THIS UP IN DIFFERENT WAYS
WE KEPT IT A SECRET FOR
ABOUT SIX RACES
CAN YOU JUST GET THAT FOR ME
WE'D SEE BUBBLING
AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE
I WAS JUST TELLING DARCY HOW
ARE YOU IN THE COUNTRY LONG
TWO THINGS MODERATELY CLEVER
THREE VERY DULL THINGS INDEED
I SEE WHAT SHE MEANS AND I WILL DO MY BEST TO HOLD MY TONGUE
SHE CANNOT SAY WHICH
IN THE COMMON COURSE
WE WILL CALL MR PERRY
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD TAKE A REFRESHING SWIM IN THE POOL
MY INSENSITIVITY LED ME TO ACT IN A WAY THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE ASHAMED OF
BUT TO ACCEPT THEM IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE
I HARDLY THINK WITH RELATIONS SUCH AS YOURS
I AM NURSE TWICE
YOU NEVER KNOW WHO YOU MIGHT MEET
AND THEY DON'T DO ANY RESEARCH
ALL BECAUSE THEY'VE HOODWINKED THE QUA
DR HESTON CARTER
I DON'T WANT STEROID INHALERS AND I DON'T WANT A PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE
JUST THE REPEAT PRESCRIPTION FOR THE INHALER THEN
CHARLES DICKENS WROTE SERIALISED NOVELS IN INSTALMENTS THAT WERE EAGERLY ANTICIPATED
AND NAMED AFTER A FAMOUS CITY THERE
WAS TO FIND A RESPECTABLE MAN TO MARRY ME
IT SENT MESSAGES FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER BY TAKING THE WORDS OF THE MESSAGE
AND TURNING THEM INTO A CODE
LIKE MORSE CODE
WHAT HAD STARTED WITH ME PLAYING PIANO FOR MY MOTHER
AND WOULD FALL ASLEEP WITHOUT WARNING
I THOUGHT AGAIN OF THE BIRDS I SPENT ALL THAT TIME DREAMING ABOUT
I CHOSE WHERE I WALKED
I LOOKED AT THE WORLD AROUND ME WITH WIDE OPEN EYES
BEFORE MOTORCARS AND MOBILE PHONES
I WAS TO BE CHIEF ENGINEER ON A BRAND NEW RAILWAY
THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY
I WAS DETERMINED TO SUCCEED
MY NAME IS MARYIANNING
WOMEN NO LONGER DEPEND UPON MARRIAGE FOR SOCIAL STANDING AND SECURITY
I COULD HAVE HELPED YOU
THEY'VE REALLY GOT TO PUSH THEMSELVES
IT'S GOT TO BE CORRECT
SO WITH A SCORE OF NINE FOR THEIR DESSERT
YOU GOT ALL THE INGREDIENTS
SO IF YOU CAN YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED TO TAKE A BREAK
THEN YOU PLAN A MENU
AND HAVING LOTS OF GLASSES OF WINE HAVING A FINE TIME
HIS KITCHEN HE ONLY COOKS FISH
HE'S A FABULOUS FISH COOK
NOTWITHSTANDING ALL OF THAT
AND YOU'LL SEE THE WHOLE THING
BUT THAT'S THE FRENCH
AND THAT IS ACTUALLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US IN ENGLAND
SO RARE THAT YOU MEET A MAN LIKE THAT THESE DAYS
QUITE THE OLD FASHIONED CHARMER
ALWAYS HAS BEEN
I THINK IT'S THE LAURENCE OLIVIER ONE
THAT IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE
THEY KNEW HOW TO DO ROMANCE IN THOSE DAYS
I CAN JUST BE REALLY
FUN FILLED PROGRAMME
I GOING TELL YOU THE MYSTERIES OF THE WEBA
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WELL IN LONDON NOW THEY ARE ANYTHING FROM FIVE
I DON'T WANT TO STOP
WE'VE ABUSED HER OYSTER FARM
ALL THE NASTY THINGS HAVE BEEN THROWN AWAY
FOR THE EAGLEEY AMONGST YOU
I CAN'T EXPLAIN NOW
I'M ACTUALLY AT A THERAPIST' OFFICE
IT WAS ALL A SILLY MISUNDERSTANDING
I'LL GET THE ICE CREAMS
WHERE I EXPLAINED THAT MIRANDA WAS ONE STICK SHORT OF A LOLLY
AND THEN THE TEACHER THOUGHT THAT MIRANDA WAS TRYING TO KIDNAP THEM
AND IF YOU'D SAY YOU'D RATHER THAT THAN ME WEARING YOUR SILK MIX THROW
BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO DISCUSS
WE'RE ONLY HERE SO THAT WE CAN SAY WE'VE BEEN
WENDY HAS BEEN EYENOED OBESE
SHE GOT RID OF MY DOG WHEN I WAS ELEVEN
SO DON'T THINK ABOUT HIM
KEEPING UP APPEARANCES
I'M INCREDIBLY UNGRATEFUL
WHEN MISTAKEN FOR BEING PREGNANT
JOINED THE LOCAL MOTHERS TO BE GROUP
FOR NO REAL REASON
YOU'VE BOUGHT A NEW COAT
YOU DON'T KNOW WHY
OUR JAPANESE FRIEND IS A BIT SMUG
MIRANDA'S BEING A BIT SILLY TODAY
IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS TO WORK OUT THAT MIRANDA'S A BIT ODD
I THINK ONE MORE BEFORE WE GO
AND I WOULD LIKE THAT FOR MYSELF
SO TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE RESALE POINT OF VIEW
YOU KNOW WITH NO RESTRICTIONS
DON'T TALK ABOUT STYLE BUT
AFTER SPENDING FIVE HOURS
SIX HOURS TRAWLING THE INTERNET
AND ACTUALLY IN THE CASE OF A KITCHEN
IT'S JUST SO ORIGINAL
WHEN I'M BUSY DOING WORK
AND THE ONLY WAY THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IS BY OPENING UP AND ALLOWING THE SPACES TO
BECAUSE THIS IS AN APARTMENT REALLY
I DON'T THINK THEY ARE GOING TO USE THIS BED VERY OFTEN ANYWAY
OCCASIONALLY THEY WILL HAVE PEOPLE TO STAY
I CAN MOUNT THAT
THEY KNOW WHO YOU ARE
THEY'RE ALL HANGING OUT
THEY'RE GAINING WEIGHT
BRITAIN IS TEEMING WITH TRULY DELICIOUS GAME
HIS CANCER WAS TERMINAL
WAS NEWTON WOMEN
I'M RINGING ON BEHALF OF SIGOURNEY
I'M A LITTLE BIT RELIEVED
I GAVE YOU THAT
IT'S OVER TOO QUICKLY
AND BEFORE I DO THAT
I'M BACK AT THE PIANO
YOU CAN DO IT WITH CARP
YOU CAN DO IT WITH PIKE
YOU HAVE WHAT THE FRENCH CALL
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FIRM FLESHED FISH
BUT AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT A FOOD PROCESSOR
VERY SLOWLY WHIZZING THE FOOD PROCESSOR THE WHOLE TIME
HARD BOILED EGGS
NEW BOILED POTATOES
OR THE MORE THEY DO WITH THINGS
EVERY MARRIAGE IS DIFFERENT
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T MAKE ANY ACCUSATIONS UNTIL I KNEW ALL THE FACTS
WHENEVER WE TALK
EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO FAKE IT
WHAT YOU NEED IS TO ATTRACT FRESH MEAT
TELL ME ABOUT IT
FOUND REASONS TO AVOID
I WOULD LOVE TO GO ON A DATE WITH YOU
WHAT'S THE POINT
I'VE SEEN MARRIAGES FLOUNDER THAT WAY
BUT WHEN WE'VE CAUGHT SOME
THEN YOU KNOW NOTHING
AND FOR OUR PAINS
I STILL THINK THE FINAL SCORE IS NEWLYN THREE
BUT AS YOU'RE BACK
BUT I MET SOMEONE LAST YEAR
THE PROPOSAL TOOK ME BY SURPRISE
DON'T USE YOUR FINGERS
YOU ALL FLOYD ON FISH
YOU CAN'T RUN THE RISK OF IT GOING OFF
THEN THEY OPEN AND CLOSE DURING THE NIGHT WHEN YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
PRESERVE OR SPICE THEIR MEAT
THIS WAS THE CENTURION'S WORCESTER SAUCE
THIS WAS THE CENTURION'S SOY SAUCE
LEFT TO FERMENT FOR THREE OR FOUR WEEKS
AT THE SAME TIME I MADE
BECAUSE THIS IS THE MAGIC OF
I HAVE TO TELL YOU I AM REALLY TIRED
TELL YOU AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE WEST COUNTRY FISH
IF YOU WANT A REAL CRAB
THE REAL KIPPER
SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES
THINGS LIKE THAT
TO MAKE THINGS REALLY AUTHENTIC
WE HAD TO KEEP THIS SECRET
I CAN SORT OF PLAY A KIND OF GASTRONOMIC BLIND MAN'S BUFF
LIKE MAKING CEMENT
BECAUSE I'M A KIND OF A SLEUTH DETECTIVE
WHY WOULDN'T THEY
SO I CAN GET A BIT APPREHENSIVE WHEN I TOY WITH THEM
PUDDING IS A PRIORITY
BUT I'VE ALSO GOT A BIT OF AN ANCIENT ROME OBSESSION
I'VE NEVER MET ANYONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE CRUMBLE
BUT NOT THE WAY I DO IT BECAUSE I QUARTER THEM
IF YOU'RE IN A GREENGROCER
BECAUSE IT TAKES ABOUT TWO MINUTES TO COOK
SO I CAN ARGUE BOTH SIDES
WHICH I HATE MYSELF FOR SO
EVEN THOUGH MY FIRST CATEGORY
I COULD ARGUE AGAINST IT AS WELL
AND ONLY ONE CHOICE CAN MAKE IT INTO THE DREADED ROOM
THE FINAL DECISION IS MINE
NO TABLES AND CHAIRS
WITH A PAPER PLATE AND A PLASTIC FORK
I DON'T WANT TO EAT THEM WITH A KNIFE AND FORK
IF GOD GIVES FOOD A HANDLE
REALLY COOKING IS JUST MAKING FOOD A BIT HOTTER
AND LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT GABBY'S CHOICE ON THE FOOD AND DRINK FRONT
AS THE VEGAS HOTELS ADVERTISE
THE BUFFET IS OBVIOUSLY THE FIRST STOP
AND ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES DID SO
AND HOW YOU CAN HAVE LOBSTER
YOU KNOW I COULD BUY CHICKEN ON ITS OWN IF I WANTED IT BUT
BUT I DIDN'T WANT IT
OCTOGENARIANS WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU NEED TO GET YOUR CASH OUT
IS JUST DISASTROUS
ALSO BEING A CHILD IN THE SEVENTY S AND BEHIND THEM IN THEQUEUE IN THE POST OFFICE SAYING
WELL I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS NEW MONEY
NOT SO LONG AGO
A FEW MONTHS AGO
THAT LONDONERS OLD PEOPLE IN LONDON ARE THE LONELIEST IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY
AND I FELT I LIVE IN LONDON
BUT MY SISTER HAS TO SLIGHTLY TAILOR THEM
BECAUSE THE LAST ONE SHE WANTED TO PUT ON WAS THE TOP IS LOVELY
AND I WAS REALLY SAD TO HEAR
SO IT'S KIND OF ON YOUR HOME GROUND AND
I TAKE MY CAR IN
IT'S A GANGLION
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
OR IS IT WOULD YOU SAY IT COMES UP A BIT BIG FOR AN AGE FIVE
COMING BACK FROM ITALY
COME PICK IT UP
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT SORT OF LIFESTYLE
SO I CAN'T HAVE AN ANIMAL
THINK YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOVE SPORT
WHO HAVE NO ENTHUSIASM FOR THE OLYMPICS
SEEING FRENCH PEOPLE CRYING ON THE TELLY THELYMPIC
IF YOU GO AND SEE A BAND
OCCASIONALLY YOU DO SEE SOMETHING AND YOU AND YOU DO THINK TO YOURSELF
BECAUSE I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THIS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK IN A WAY IT'S QUITE BAD OF ME
I'M GOING TO TRY AND CHANGE MY WAYS
YOU WERE SO PASSIONATE
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN WAY
FEAST IS WHERE IT ALL STARTED
ONE DAY HE DISAPPEARED
THE ENGINE DISAPPEARED
AND WRITERS LIKE AGATHA CHRISTIE
THIS IS THE FORERUNNER OF THOSE GAME
MORECRO IS IS VERY COLLECTABLE
WE CAN PUT THAT AT FIFTY
BUT I DON'T KNOW
MY FAVOURITE LOT OF THE DAY
BECAUSE I KNOW
CAFES AND WAREHOUSES
PAINTING TALENTS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
BUT IF YOU SEE THAT
AND I HAVE MANY MANY TIMES
HAUNTING ATMOSPHERE AND I JUST WANT TO BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH THAT
EITHER DEATH OR DEATH AND THE MAIDEN
PARTLY WAS FRUSTRATED
JUST ALONG THE SHORELINE FROM TORQUAY
MANY PEOPLE THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE INCLINED
THE ONE YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED AT LINTON IS A WATER BALANCE ONE
AND SOME ARE DRUM DRIVE
LET'S GET DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY
I MEAN CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO THE LAYMAN
THIS IS AN ELECTRICAL TRACTION ONE
MAKING WAY FOR OTHERS TO FOLLOW IN ITS WAKE
OVER TWO SEASONS
WE TOOK IT OUT FOR THE FIRST SEASON
IT'S THE WATCH MOUNTED INTO THE BRACE
WE DISCOVER WHO HAS WON THE PRESTIGIOUS TWENTY THIRTEEN TEACHING AWARD
BUT SUPPORTED BY PEARSON UK
PUT DOWN YOUR RED PENS
CLOSE YOUR HOMEWORK BOOKS AND ENJOY YOUR EVENING
BECAUSE TONIGHT IS FOR YOU
AND YOU ALL THOROUGHLY DESERVE IT
COLLEGES AND EVEN NURSERIES
TO FIND THOSE AT THE TOP OF THE TEACHING WORLD
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
WE HAVE AN INSPIRATIONAL WOMAN
RACIALLY MOTIVATED ATTACK
FOR EVERY YEAR OF THE TWENTY SINCE IT HAPPENED
SHE HAS CAMPAIGNED FOR JUSTICE
AND THE TEACHER SAID TO ME KNOW
YOU KNOW SOMETHING
HOW DO WE HELP OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE
I'M DELIGHTED TO PRESENT THE AWARD TO A HEAD TEACHER OF THE YEAR IN A SECONDARY SCHOOL
WE HAVE IT IN THE CURRICULUMS DRAMA AND WE HAVE A SPECIAL PERFORMANCE GROUP THAT WORKS TOGETHER
AND I FELT THAT TO DO THAT
AND YOU ARE CLEARLY VERY INVENTIVE
THAT CELEBRATES ALL THINGS HARRY POTTER TO SURPRISE A VERY SPECIAL TEACHER
I'D LIKE TO SAY THIS AWARD IS FOR HER EXTENSIVE FOOTWEAR COLLECTION
THAT WOULD BE A SURPRISE BUT
AND I SEE THAT CHILD DOES IT
PATIENCE AND A DEEP PASSION FOR TEACHING
I'M HERE AT THE WARNER BROTHERS STUDIO TOUR
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
FURTHER EDUCATION OPENS UP NEW PATHWAYS TO SUCCESS FOR TEENAGERS AND OFFERS ADULTS A FRESH START IN
TO PRESENT THIS AWARD
SHE'S HAD AN INCREDIBLE CAREER
SPANNING OVER FORTY YEARS
YET STILL FINDS TIME TO CAMPAIGN FOR THE VULNERABLE
THE LONELY AND THE ABUSED
WE HAVE NOW HELPED THREE POINT
YOUR LIFE CHANGES
MAYBE THE KIDS GO UP AND MAYBE YOU HAVE TO MOVE FROM THE PLACE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH
I WROTE A LITTLE POEM TO CAROLINE AND AND ILLUSTRATED IT
I'M HAPPY TO TELL YOU
FROM COLLEAGUE CAMBRIA IN WREXHAM
HE BRINGS TO LIFE THE PROJECT
AND A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT THAT ARE MADE END UP BEING SOLD
SO HE WILL ALWAYS BE MY HERO
PLEASE WELCOME THE TOGMEISTER HIMSELF
SO FAMOUS IS THIS MAN
HE'S BEEN MENTIONED IN YES
APPEARED IN THE VICAR OF DIBLEY AND
HAD SUCH A HUGE IMPACT ON HIS LIFE
THAT HE BECAME HIS BEST FRIEND AND EVEN HIS BEST MAN
SO BECAUSE OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY BOND
THESE NEW TEACHERS ARE OFTEN THE LIFEBLOOD OF THEIR SCHOOLS
UM THEY JUST NEED THAT LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA HELP
THESE TEACHERS ARE THE ONES WHO SET THEM UP FOR LIFE AND HELP THEM ALONG THE WAY
TO PRESENT THIS AWARD
JOHNNY DEPP AND JULIA ROBERTS
THEY ARE REALLY GOOD AT JAPANESE AND ALSO IT MUST BE ONE OF THE MOST SIMPLE LANGUAGES TO STUDY
FROM A GRAMMATICAL POINT OF VIEW
ALSO STUDENTS WHO HAVE DYSLEXIA
YEAH DYSLEXIA DOESN'T SHOW UP IN JAPANESE
AND THE FACT THERE ARE SO MANY OF MY SUPPORTERS HERE
WE PICK UP THE STORY WHEN MATILDA FACES UP TO HER MISERABLE LOT AND DECIDES THAT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
SO FOR THE FIRST TIME ON TELEVISION
PLEASE WELCOME ONE OF THE FOUR AMAZINGLY TALENTED GIRLS WHO SHARE THE LEAD
BUT IT IS THE BIG ONE IT'S LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT
BUT BEFORE THAT
WE HAVE A TREAT IN STORE
AND IT TELLS THE STORY OF A GIFTED CHILD WITH WOEFULLY INADEQUATE PARENTS
HER HORRIBLE HEADM MISTRESS AND SHE REALLY IS
LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARDED TO THE PERSON WHO HAS DEVOTED A LIFETIME TO NURTURING
DEVELOPING AND ENCOURAGING YOUNG TALENT
THEY HAD ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND LONG RUNNING LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT SHOWS ON BRITISH
AND HE'S STILL UNRIVALLED IN THE ART OF THE SHAGGY DOG STORY
RECENTLY HE'S BEEN INTO SHAGGY DOGS OF A DIFFERENT KIND WITH RONNIE'S ANIMAL CRACKERS ON BBC ONE
EVEN FROM A YOUNG AGE
I WAS TOTALLY OVERWHELMED
OR AS THEY SEE IN THE SCOTS
TOGETHER AS ONE
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN NOMINATE THEM FOR NEXT YEAR'S AWARDS AND YOU CAN DO THAT RIGHT NOW
MORE HEROES OF THE CLASSROOM WHO USE THEIR TALENTS TO BRING OUT THE TALENTS IN THE REST OF US
CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL OF OUR WINNERS
AND TO THE TEACHERS
THE HEAD TEACHERS
THE TEACHING ASSISTANTS IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT
AND THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS WATCHING AT HOME
THANK YOU FOR YOUR IMAGINATION
YOUR PROFESSIONALISM AND YOUR HARD WORK
BECAUSE YOU HATED THEM
I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS
SO I THINK I SAID
W THE WHOLE WELL NOT THE WHOLE TIME
AMONGST YOUR PEERS
IN TERMS OF THE SORT OF PACKING ORDER OF SCHOOL
THAT HE MADE IT LOOK EASY
IN A MERCE IN MERCENARY WAY
SO WHERE WOULD I STAND
SO I WOULD GO FROM ONE CLASSROOM TO THE NEXT
A JOURNEY WHICH WOULD TAKE A MINUTE
AND I WOULD TAKE FIVE MINUTES
OR I STARTED TO WIN THEM
ALL THOSE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T DIDN'T GROW UP WITH
WHEN I LEFT RADLEY
I THOUGHT THAT WHAT YOU DID WHEN YOU
AND YET WE COME FROM TOTALLY OPPOSITE ENDS OF OF
THEN I'D BE REALLY SAD
FRIENDS FOR LIFE AND PEOPLE THAT
BUT WE WE SHARE A VERY SIMILAR SENSIBILITY
AND PEOPLE TO LOVE YOU BACK
THIS IS WHAT I SAY TO JAMES
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY
AND FOR WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ACHIEVE
I DON'T THINK THAT
AS I WAS THAT AGE
I'LL BE INVESTIGATING
YOU FEEL THESE ROCKS HAVE BEEN LIFTED OUT OF THEIR HOME
CARRIED AWAY AND DROPPED
AND WE LOOKED BACK AT SOME OF THE RESOURCEFUL PEOPLE WE'VE MET RECENTLY WHO MANAGED TO GATHER FOOD FROM
IF THEY ARE OVER THE TOP
IF THEY HAVE POISONOUS MUSHROOMS
AND THEN CERTAINLY THERE'S THERE'S INCREASING EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS
AND THEN PICKING OUT ALL THE EDIBLE THINGS THAT THEY THEY THEY WANT TO EAT THEMSELVES OR THEY WANT TO SELL
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DONE RESPONSIBLY
THAT'S WHAT I'LL BE INVESTIGATING LATER
PER SQUARE FOOT
AND IN THE RUN UP TO THE BIG EVENT
WE'RE MEETING THE NATIONAL TEAMS
LATER IN THE SHOW
THIS EXPOSED SUBSTRATE
SO THEY CAN BASK IN THE SUNSHINE AND WARM THEMSELVES UP
AND BUT THIS IS A TEAM EVENT
I'LL GIVE THEM BACK
SO I ALMOST GOT THERE
IT'LL PROBABLY BE ME
IF I IF IT GOES WRONG
SO HOW DO WE STRIKE A HEALTHY BALANCE
BECAUSE HE WAS WORKING WELL AND TRIALLING WELL AND
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THAT PRAISE
FINDING A YOUNG DOG WHO'S SHOWING ALL THE RIGHT SIGNS FOR WORKING SHEEP CAN PAY DIVIDENDS
AND THIS IS YOUNG JESS
AND TALKING OF THINGS TO LOOK FORWARD TO
BUT IT'S NOT AFFECTED BY IT
FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND FOR THE LOCAL SHIPPING
I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT
HE RAN AN EXEMPLARY FAMILY
SHE WAS A PROCTOR
YOU'RE EITHER ENGAGED OR YOU'RE NOT
IT MUST BE IN THERE
SHE'S GOING TO BE MRS WHATEVER HIS LAST NAME IS
TWENTY FOUR PAIRS OF NOBODY BRIEFS
TRY ANOTHER SWING
OTHERWISE EVERY TIME IT RAINED
SEE THIS IS HALF WOOL AND HALF EXTRUDED MANADE FIBRE
I'M HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH THOSE THINGS
AND SOME THAT I WON'T
AND MRS LU FEELS SO STRONGLY
GET INTO A NICE HOTEL
YOUR KINDNESS TO ME WILL NOT GO UNNOTICED
I USED OVERNIGHT TAN
HELP YOU THROUGH LIFE'S WEARY PROBLEMS
IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU
WHEN YOU COME TO MY TIME OF LIFE
YOU ARE ON DUTY AGAIN
THE ERO OF YPRES
I HAVE SOME NEWS
THE MONEY YOU PROMISED TO AMBUSH
GOEBBELS SAID SO ON THE VI
TWELVE LITRES OF PARIS
JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME
GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS
HE WAS VERY HAPPY
AND THEY'VE CHANGED SO MUCH OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS WITH THE ADVENT OF INTERNET
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY BEFORE
COMPLETELY ACROSS THE RANGE
BUT THE SMALLS NOT QUITE SO WELL
EXPERTS CAN'T BE RIGHT ALL THE TIME AND SOMETIMES THEY GET IT WRONG
WE'RE IN DERBYSHIRE
ONE CALLED ST JOHN'S WALTON
I THINK IF YOU HAVE A BAD DAY
THAT'S THE BEST ONE
IT'S A UNIT WITHIN A LARGER CENTRE IN SHEFFIELD AND CELL FROM THERE
IT'S QUITE A GOOD SENSE OF COMMUNITY IN THERE
THIS IS A JOLLY TRIBE
THESE GUYS SPENT EIGHTEEN MINUTES BUYING THREE ITEMS SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO
IN THE BLUE GALLERY
WHAT SORT OF AN IMPRESSION ARE THEY ABOUT TO MAKE AND WILL THEY COIN IN
I KNOW IT'S I KNOW IT'S NOT VERY OLD
BUT I KNOW IT'S BEEN KNOCKED UP
I THINK IS PLUS EIGHTEEN
PO THAT'S VERY GOOD
CHANGING HIS MIND LIKE THAT
THEY'VE TAKEN THE VIDEO AGAIN
I'LL GIVE YOU MY NAME AND ADDRESS
WHAT ARE NEIGHBOURS FOR
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU SOMEHOW
THAT'S TWICE IN THREE MONTHS
I'M AFRAID THAT'S WHAT WE USE
BUT I REMEMBER THINKING THEN
THAT'S VERY NICE
IF I EVER HAVE AN ALARM
NO WORSE THAN YOUR AVERAGE HUMAN BEING
ESPECIALLY BY THE LOWER CLASS TYPE OF BURGLAR WHO GOES TO NO
WHICH FOUR NUMBER CODE HAVE YOU CHOSEN TO STOP AND START THE SYSTEM
ENJOY YOUR EVENING
I DO NOT MEAN RIVERSIDE PICNIC
HE ALWAYS GOES LOOKING FOR MRS PENDLEBURY
YOU'RE QUITE SAFE NOW
BECAUSE I LIKE PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT I USE FIRST CLASS
YOU DON'T OWE ME THANKS
THEY'VE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD
AND SO I AM A FREE MAN
WHICH IS A VERY GRAND NAME FOR ONE ROOM ABOVE THE EMAN
YOU HAVE DONE WELL
GOT THE BRIGHTON PAVILION JUST UP THE ROAD
AND MAYBE A HOLIDAY FOR MY OTHER SON
ON THE OTHER SIDE
AND WHEN THIS IS FULLY UP LIKE
IT NEEDS RESTORATION
I LOVE THIS SORT OF ENGRAVED CASE
LAST NIGHT WE GOT THIS REAL GEM
WHAT ABOUT MIGRATION ITSELF
THE RESERVE HAS HAD ITS NUMBERS SWOLLEN BY STARLINGS
AND MARTIN HAS GONE OUT THERE TO TRY AND FIND OUT EXACTLY WHY THEY HAVE COME TO THE RESERVE
WE WON'T BE ABLE PROVIDE WITH ALL THE ANSWERS
SPEC A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO USE IT LIVE FOR THE FIRST TIME
THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC
COURSE BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS PLACE
FROM THE EAST WHERE IT IS CONSIDERABLY COLDER
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE A VERY CHARACTERISTIC CALL
STAND ON THE DOORSTEP AND LISTEN
BECAUSE THEY WILL MOVE ABOUT AT NIGHT AND
BUT WE'D LIKE YOU TO LOOK OUT FOR THESE BIRDS
WITH THIS SPECIAL CAMERA WE CAN PEER INTO THE HEART OF THE COLONY AND START TO SEE WHAT
HAS PROBABLY BLOWN LOADS OF LEAVES OFF OF THE TREES BUT GARDENERS
IT WOULD BE POINTLESS
AND THE DEBATE CONTINUES ABOUT BADGES IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
BUT TO REALLY APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL BIRD
IT SWAPS THE HEAT
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT THERE IN NATURE AND SEE IT FOR REAL
BEAUTIFUL PICTURES RIGHT IN THERE IN THE HEART OF THE ROOSTER
TIMES NOT EXCEPTIONALLY SO THOUGH
NO REAL SIGN OF THE WINDS COMING IN FROM THE NORTH OR THE EAST FOR A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME TO AID THE
THIS WOULD BE A PERFECT PLACE TO FIND MY FAVOURITE FOOD
THEY ARE BOUND TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THE BADGER
BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE SCIENCE OR SEE THE DEBATE FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE
OR IN FACT JOIN IN THE DEBATE AND LET US KNOW YOUR VIEW
THEN GO TO THE WEBSITE
GET READY FOR A GOURMET'S GREATEST HITS
WE BEGIN WITH AN ITALIAN CHEESE THAT IS TRADITIONALLY MADE WITH THE MILK OF A WATER BUFFALO
IT'S BEEN OVERLOOKED AND OVERCOOKED FOR FAR TOO LONG
BUT WHEN DONE PROPERLY
IS PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR GIVING THIS WONDERFUL MEAT ITS BAD REPUTATION
YOU THROW IT IN THE OVEN A COUPLE OF HOURS
AND IT'S VERY SIMPLE
WE'VE GOT AN EXCITING CONTEST TODAY
THAT'S HOW WE MET
WE ALL OUT CHARM OFFENSIVE
YOUR EXPERTS AWAIT
AND I REALLY ENJOY IT
BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE PAYING THE FULL PRICE FOR THAT
VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS
VERY NICE TO BE HERE
WE'VE GOT A SELECTION FOR YOU TODAY
MOVING SWIFTLY ON
SHE USED TO BE BAXTER'S BISCUITS
I'M GOING TO TAKE RICHARD OUT FOR A BIRTHDAY DRINK
MAYBE I COULD SNEAK HIM OFF FOR A QUIET DRINK
I WILL NOT HAVE YOU GOING ABOUT WITH SHABBY
REALLY THOUGHT YOU'D TAKE TO ALL THIS MUCH QUICKER
IN THE EYES OF MY FLOCK
THAT'S WHAT MARRIAGE IS ABOUT
PEOPLE COME IN DISMAY AND DESPAIR AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN HELP
TODAY COULD BE THE DAY I'M MISTAKEN FOR SOMEONE
NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE STREET
WE GO ALONG HERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE
IT'S BEEN WHILE SINCE I'VE BEEN TO A SALE
THAT MIGHT JUST BE WITHIN OUR RANGE
WE OUGHT TO BE GOING
HERO OF THE RESISTANCE
ESCAPED IN A GYPSY CARAVAN PULLED BY A PIEBALD PONY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WE FRENCH ARE LIKE THAT
ANYTHING FOR A LAUGH
SEND BRITISH UNIFORMS TONIGHT
WITHOUT THEM THEY WILL BE SHOT
I WILL GET YOU SOME MORE WINE
SHE DOES NOT MIND
BIG JACK PLANES
AND I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL
BUT MOST OWNERS WENT HOME VERY
FIRST WHY WOULD A WATER RAIL CALL TO US
VERY VERY TERRITORIAL
NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER MALES OUT THERE
BACK TO THE SEA WATER SO THEY MIGRATE BACK AGAIN
NOT JUST THE SALMON
BUT THE WADING BIRDS AS WELL
EVEN THESE AREN'T THE CHAMPION
DOWN HERE TO ARGENTINA
AND IN THE SPRING THEY GO BACK UP HERE TO DELAWARE BAY BEFORE GOING BACK AGAIN
IN SIX DAYS AND SIX NIGHTS
OUR MIGRATION WATCH IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RSPB AND WE ASK YOU TO LOOK OUT FOR THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF
THEY'RE NOT VERY FAR AWAY FROM ME
WE THINK THAT'S NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE
DON'T SORT OF WRESTLE WITH THE CUBS
BUT WHICH TOP CHEF GO TURN TO FOR INSPIRATION TODAY
WE'VE GOT ALL YOUR FAVOURITES HERE THE NATION'S TOP TV CHEFS
ALL IN ONE PLACE
LIKE THE CHILD OF THE TAKEAWAY
WHILST COOKING THIS RECIPE
RACHEL KU KEEPS ON SAYING TO US THAT IT'S NOT THAT EASY ON THE NOSE
IT'S A BIT WHIFFY
I KNOW A LOT OF OUR PICKLING CUCUMBERS
I KNOW ABOUT PICKLING OTHER VEGETABLES
AND MOST OF THEM ACTUALLY COME FROM FRANCE
IT'S A REAL SHAME
THAT'S ALL THE COOKING WE'VE GOT TIME FOR TODAY
HOW'S YOUR DAY GOING
WHAT DO YOU THINK
A BOULANGER FAN LIKE THIS
LET'S REMIND OURSELVES WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
THIS WAS THE MOST FORMAL ENTERTAINING ROOM THE WITHDRAWING ROOM
BUT DON'T WORRY
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE AUCTION
DO PICK THE VICAR UP
YOU JUST FOLLOW ORDERS
I'VE BEEN CONSCRIPTED
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
WHY DON'T I GO TO GREENLAND
EVEN IF I GOT TO GREENLAND
ALEXANDER THE GREAT WAS CONQUERING PERSIA
SHES NOT THE ONE WITH THE MERCEDES
I WAS HOPING FOR A QUIET DAY
IT'S A BIG RESPONSIBILITY
SOME PEOPLE HAVE FOREPLAY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
SHE GAVE ME ONE OF HER SMILES
HE NEVER REALLY STOOD A CHANCE
YOU CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER IT
I CAN NOW DEAL WITH THE NORMAL
AND WHEN I AM WITH MY WIFE
COME TO ME TONIGHT
THEY HAVE BEEN HIDDEN IN THE CUPBOARD BY THE UNDERGROUND
NOT IF WE SPLIT THE PROCEEDS
IT'S A VERY AFFLUENT AREA
AT THE SAME TIME
THE CANOPY'S REALLY QUITE SMART
BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE HANDLES RELATIVE THE WHOLE BASKET
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD
PEOPLE THOSE THAT BUY TOYS
SEATED BELOW STILL THEN AT SIXTY FIVE
BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING OUT THERE NOW AT NIGHT
THE THING THAT DRAWS THEM ALL HERE IS A QUARTER OF A MILLION WADERS ARRIVE HERE IN AUTUMN
AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT ANY SIGHTINGS OF HEN HOW THAT YOU HAVE
SO IF YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN ONE
AND NOW YOU CAN TELL THEM APART
SQUARE KILOMETER OF THAT WITH ALL THE SPECIALIST SPECIES THAT LIVE THERE
OUR CAMERAMAN WILL BE THERE SHOWING YOU THOSE STARLINGS LEAVING THE ROOST
AND IT CAN BE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING RATHER SPOOKY HAPPENED TO US JUST BEFORE THE SHOW
AND REALLY IT DID
THE STORM THAT HIT MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY EARLY ON IN THE WEEK
INSTEAD WE GOT THIS
IT'S VERY CALM AT THE MOMENT
AND ACTUALLY WE GOT HIT REALLY HARD
WE GOT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT
THE BIRD'S BILL
THE ONLY PROBLEM CAN COME IS IF IT'S IN A DEAD TREE AND THERE'S A LOT OF IVY
IT CAN CATCH THE WIND AND IT MIGHT TOPPLE OVER
AND WHEN IT IS GROWING ON WALLS
BUT WE DID LEARN A LOT FROM THAT EXPERIMENT AND
AND WE OBVIOUSLY SAW THE THINGS THE BIRDS EAT ON
AND IT DID NO DAMAGE TO THE WALL
IT PROTECTED IT FROM FROST
SALT AND POLLUTION
WE WANT TO FIND MORE OUT ABOUT THE WAY THESE ANIMALS LIVE ALONGSIDE US
IT' A GREAT RESOURCE FOR WILDLIFE
IN AMONGST ALL OF THESE BUILDINGS
AND HERE YOU CAN SEE FOXES LYING UP IN THE DAYTIME
BRINGING FOOD TO EAT IT SECURELY
IN THE SPRING TIME
WHERE ARE THE BEST PLACES OUT THERE TO FEED
THERE ARE SOME PLACES THAT ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS
AND IT ALL DRIES OUT
BUT IT'S NOT BIT ONLY ABOUT THAT
OTTERS WILL TAKE BIRDS
WE KNOW IT'S VAST WE KNOW IT'S FULL OF LIFE
DON'T WANDER OUT INTO THE MUDFLATS ON YOUR OWN
AND LET'S JUST GO BACK TO THAT MAP THAT DAWN HAD THERE
BECAUSE FEEDING IS SOMETHING WHICH WE' HAVE IMMEDIATELY LEARNED
AND THAT'S HUMANS FEEDING FOXES IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THESE ANIMALS
LET'S JUST RECAP
OUTSIDE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVIDING IT FOR THEM
COURSE WHEN THEY DO THAT
TOMORROW WE'RE GOING TO HEAD NORTH
OUT OF THE CITY AND INTO THE SUBURBS TO LOOK AT SOME MIDDLE CLASS FOXES AND SEE HOW THEY LIVE THERE
SIMPLY WHAT SEX THEY ARE
MORE MANIPULATION OF HYDRAULIC
AND WE THINK SOME OF THIS IS DOWN TO OBSTRUCTIONS IN THE WATERWAY
MOST PEOPLE DEFINE ANTIQUE AS SOMETHING THAT'S AROUND ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD
FOR THE MOST PART
THE MODERN ERA WAS ALL ABOUT MASS PRODUCTION
WHICH MEANS MODERN COLLECTIBLES AREN'T VALUED FOR THEIR RARITY
WE'RE GOING TO BE EXPLORING WHAT MAKES A TWENTIETH CENTURY DESIGN CLASSIC AND WHAT NAMES AND
GO FOR SOMETHING THAT SPEAKS OF A PERIOD
BASICALLY FISHERMEN THAT WERE OUT OF WORK
IF IT WAS ROUGH AND THEY COULDN'T GO OUT IN THEIR BOATS
THEN SOMEBODY WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO WORK WITH COPPER
YOU THINK OF WILLIAM DE MORGAN AND HIS WONDERFUL TILES HIS CERAMICS AND YOU THINK OF PEARSON AND
THAT REMINDS ME OF THE THIRTY S
NOT JUST IN THE WORLD OF TEDDY BEARS WE'VE ALL HEARD OF IT BUT ALSO
A SIGNIFICANT NAME IN TWENTIETH CENTURY DESIGN
LET'S NOT FORGET
THIS LADY IN A MALE DOMINATED WORLD AND WAS THE PIONEER OF TEDDY BEARS AND EVEN INVENTED
VERY SOUGHT AFTER
SO THE RAREST AND THEREFORE THE MOST VALUABLE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
A HARLEQUIN EXAMPLE MADE ALMOST FIFTY
WHICH IS A LOT OF MONEY FOR ANY TEDDY BEAR
THEY WERE QUITE COMMON EXAMPLES
THEY'RE NOT THAT RARE OR VALUABLE SO TWO PEOPLE GOT CARRIED AWAY AND THAT'S WHEN YOU END UP WITH A
SIMPLY AND SO
THERE ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS
AH FLAPPER GIRLS DANCING IN THE BACKGROUND
MORE AND MORE ALIVE BY EVERY BED
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE PAINTWORK ISN'T CHIPPED
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE THE RARER ONES
WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS BUYING ON A BUDGET
CREATING THAT LOOK BUT WITHOUT SPENDING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF POUNDS
NOR WILL ANYONE ELSE THAT YOU'RE SAT WITH
BUT SOMETIMES IMITATIONS CAN BE OF VALUE
AS NICK HALL EXPLAINS
EASILY KNOCK THAT OVER BECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT
HE CHOSE THE RIGHT THING
SO HERE ARE OUR EXPERTS TO GIVE YOU THE LOWDOWN ON WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR AND WHAT MAKES THEM SO POPULAR
THE REACTION WAS WONDERFUL
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE
YOU'VE GOT A VERY GOOD PRODUCT
BUT WITH LALIQUE
YOU HAVE YOU'VE GOT HIS NAME
YOU'VE GOT THE CACHE OF HIS NAME
WHICH MAKES IT A GUILT EDGED INVESTMENT
WITH THAT CLOCK
YOU HAD A WONDERFUL PIECE AS WELL
SO ADD THE TWO TOGETHER
YOU CAN'T REALLY FAIL
SHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST
WE'VE JUST HAD THE FIRST WORLD WAR
A LOT OF THE MEN HAD PASSED AWAY
SHE LOOKED TO MODERNISM
SHE LOOKED TOWARDS THE CONTINENT FOR INSPIRATION
SO I WAS INSTANTLY DRAWN TOWARDS IT
AND THIS WAS A LOVELY EXAMPLE
NOT JUST TO THROW IT ON THE TIP
TAKE IT ALONG TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS AND GET IT CHECKED OUT
FOR THE RIGHT THING
I PROBABLY WOULD
BUT THERE ARE MANY MORE OUT THERE
WHOSE WORK DESERVES MORE ATTENTION
SO SO DO YOU GO HOME AND QUESTION WHAT YOU'VE GOT
AND I TELL YOU WHAT
AND I HOPE IT'S INSPIRED YOU TO DO THE SAME THING
QUESTION WHAT YOU'VE SURROUNDED YOURSELF WITH
EXPERTS ARE REGULARLY ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THOSE STANDOUT PIECES
SO CHRISTINA WAS DELIGHTED TO MEET LESLEY
BUT I THOUGHT I'D SEE SOMETHING FOR IT
AND SO I PUT SOME IN PREMIUM BONDS AND SAID
JUST NUD JOURNEY FOR ME WHILE YOU'RE THERE
NOW DO THE BUSINESS BUT
BUT HE HASN'T BEEN LISTENING YET
I HAD LOTS OF PEOPLE SAY TO ME
AND I COULD ALMOST HEAR MY HUSBAND SAYING
BUT I'M TRYING AND I'LL GET THERE IN THE END
I HOPE THAT'S GIVEN YOU SOME INSPIRATION TO HAVE A RUMMAGE IN YOUR ATTICS
AH YOU COULD BE SITTING ON A SMALL FORTUNE
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY'S TRADE SECRETS
MY FREESTYLE FLORAL DECORATION FOR A TABLE CENTREPIECE DESERVED A FIRST PRIZE
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SMALL
TO FEEL BETTER ALREADY
WOULD YOU COME AWAY FROM THAT CAR
MIND THE PEDESTRIAN
SHE'S WHY WE GET UP AN HOUR EARLY
I DO NOT HAVE A SPECIAL OFFER ON SPICY PRAWN BALLS
ALSO I FEEL IT'S A DUTY ON MY PART
TORN BETWEEN THE RINGING AND THE FATE OF MY POLISH TABLE OR HANDADE BURMESE RUG
I THINK I CAN PROMISE YOU
WE SHAN'T LET YOU DOWN
HOW AM I GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE
WELL I HOPE THEY HAVE A GOOD PLAN
IF YOU GIVE US AWAY
NOVEMBER IS IDEAL
DECEMBER IS FINE BUT
IT' IS REALLY HARD TO PICK EXACTLY THE RIGHT ONES AND SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO GO AND SEE THEM
A BUCKET WOULD DO
BUT UPSIDE DOWN
JUST ABOVE FREEZING
WHICH IS AS FULL OF MEMORIES AS IT IS OF FLOWERS
BEING SUCH A BUSY WOMAN
THAT'S IT FOR THIS WEEK
I HOPE YOU HAVE A REALLY GOOD WEEKEND AND NEXT WEEK WE'RE BACK AT OUR NORMAL TIME OF
TELL YOU THERE IS ONE ON ITS WAY
THE WILDLIFE ARC TRUST HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING A VACCINE FOR RED SQUIRRELS SO THEY DON'T GET THE
I AM GOING DOWN TO THE WILD WOOD
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM COME HERE EVERY YEAR
YOU GOT NATURAL MORTALITY
NO MEANS OF SNEAKING UP
STILL ALIVE AND DOING WELL
SO ONE MINUTE WE ARE ENJOYING THE SPECTACLE
NOW WE HAVEN'T ANALYSED ALL OF THE DATA YET
FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF ALL OF OUR SIGHTINGS CAME FROM PEOPLE DRIVING THEIR CARS OR PASSENGERS IN THEIR CARS
DOES THIS MEAN WE ARE SPOTTING MORE KS WHEN WE ARE DRIVING SIMPLY BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING FOR THEM
THE AUTUMN RAT HAS UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCES
NOW I MET A MAN WHO IS PASSIONATE ABOUT BRITISH DEER
HERE IS AN AMAZING FACT OWLS CAN TELL EACH OTHER'S VOICES
THEY HAVEN'T HAD A GREAT BREEDING SEASON
ACCORDING TO THE BTO SURVEY
BECAUSE AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING
BECAUSE THEY ARE REPEATEDLY SURVEYED
OUR ORCHESTRAL SURVEY
PREDOMINANTLY FROM THE ATLANTIC
IT WILL OFTEN BE WINDY
AGAIN PREDOMINANTLY FROM THE ATLANTIC
PERHAPS ON MONDAY
KEEP THOSE COMING IN
THAT MAKES IT EASY
NOW BARRY SEEMS TO THINK THIS IS A CARVED STONE
BUT IF IT WAS OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OLD IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE THE TUSK OF A
BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
AND IT LAID EGGS
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR SHIRT
LET'S NOT RULE THAT OUT
WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE ROCKET DEAL AGAIN
THEY NEED AN ECM ADVISER
IT'S MILES AWAY
AND THE CORKAGE
THEY'D FLY HOME
WE GOT BACK IN THE COLD LIGHT OF GATWICK AIRPORT
WHEN YOU GOT HOME
HOW TO RECREATE IT
YOU WANTED TO MAKE IT WHEN YOU COME HOME
NOT A PAN OF MUD
BECAUSE HERE TO ASSIST US
I CAN PUT THIS IN
RI BE BRILLIANT
EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE TO PAY A COUPLE OF PENNIES MORE
IT PEOPLE GO TO YOUR RESTAURANT BECAUSE YOU DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN THAN THE
AND IN THE SAME WAY
IT'S FORCED AIR
YOU HAVE A VERY FIRM PAIR
MAYBE FOR A DAY
WHICH IS A BIRD WHICH
CLARISSA FROM THE TWO FAT LADIES ABSOLUTELY LOS IN THE WILD
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO GET COOKING
THANKS TO ALL OUR CHEFS
I LIKE BEING IN PLACES
I HATE GETTING THERE
I DON'T HAVE THAT SENSE OF COMPULSION
THEN YOU START AGAIN
SINCE THAT TIME
THEY ALL SAID I CONTRIBUTED EFFECTIVELY TO THE ATMOSPHERE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
ON THE THRESHOLD OF GREATNESS IN THE ENGLISH THEATRE
I WENT TO HOLLYWOOD
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
THE VERY RARE
I'M NOT POWERFUL
I'VE GOT ABOUT FIFTY
AND I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT I WOULD HAVE GONE MAD
IF YOU SURVIVE SUCH A BACKGROUND
WHEN HE SAID A FEW DRINKS
LEE WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO HIM HOW TO ACT
HE WAS VERY GOOD
BLOW LET THE WILD
AND THE ENVOI IS ALWAYS DYING
I'VE DONE THE MOST UTTER RUBBISH
I WAS SO FASCINATED
IT'S ROCK HUDSON AND ALL THE CLOSE UPS
IT'S AN ENGLISHMAN CALLED GREEN
I EARNED EIGHT MILLION
STOP DOING THAT
I WOULDN'T QUARREL WITH THAT
HEADLONG RUSH TOWARD
I THINK YOU'LL HAVE WON IT
WHEN IT COMES TO MARKET VALUE
AND IT WAS ABOUT QUARTER PAST ONE
ENERGY EFFICIENT HOMES THE ARCHITECTS TURNED TO THE PREFAB
ARCHITECTS HAVE TAKEN THE IDEA OF THE FLAT PACK
COULD LITERALLY RUN WITH IT
USING ENERGY EFFICIENT RECYCLED MATERIALS
BELIEVE IT OR NOT
IT'S RECYCLED TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES WHICH ARE PUMPED IN AFTERWARDS
THERE'S A BIT OF VITALITY ABOUT THE PLACE
WE AGREED WITH YOUR VALUATION
IT'S GOING TO SELL
WE ARE COMING BACK HERE LATER ON IN THE SHOW
THERE WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BUYING A SMALL SIZE AND THEN LEAVING IT SLIGHTLY OPEN AT THE BACK
THEY CHOSE THE ONE THAT WAS COMFORTABLE
THAT'S IT REALLY
WHISPER IN MY EAR
TWO GLASS VASES JUST ABOUT TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
NUMBER DO IT FOR YOU
WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL
AND THEY FALL OVER ALL THE TIME
WE'VE GOT TWO OPTIONS
I'M TRYING TO MAKE AMENDS
HOW YOU WANTED ME DEAD
LOOK AT THIS PLACE
YOU SEE IT MONGOLIA
YOU SEE IT IN THE ANCIENT MEDITERRANEAN WORLD
AND THESE PEOPLE WERE INVADERS
IF THEIR FRIENDS AND EVEN THE TEACHERS DON'T KNOW THE MEANING
AND HERTFORDSHIRE DOESN'T REALLY SPRING TO MIND
EVER TASTED APPLE JUICE SO FRESH
ALL OF THIS DONE WITHIN HALF AN HOUR
IT COULD BE PEAR SHAPED
I PICK WHAT I CAN
ESPECIALLY ON A DAY LIKE TODAY
BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO PROFIT BY INTENTIONALLY SPOILING IT
THEY GET THE DANGER OF THE WASTE ON THEIR LAND AND END UP PAYING
AND IT'S SCARRING SOME BEAUTIFUL PARTS OF OUR COUNTRYSIDE
SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT
I'LL BE FINDING OUT LATER
WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE TRICKS OF THE TRADE AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE VILLAINS SO WE'LL LET
THERE'S VERY LIT FOOD PLACES KNOW THAT IF WE BELIEVE FLY TIPPING IS GOING TO GO ON THAT WE COULDN'T TARGET
TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE
AND WE'RE WE WE'RE KEEN TO ADDRESS THAT AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM ONLY THIS MONTH TO LOOK AT
THERE COULD BE EYES IN ANY HEDGEROW
IT IS A SPLENDID AUTUMNAL DAY HERE AT THE HENRY MOORE FOUNDATION BUT WHAT HAS THE REST OF THE WEEK
TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME IS ALL ABOUT THE MOON AND WE'LL BE FINDING OUT ABOUT THE LATEST MISSION TO GO
HERE'S PETE LAWRENCE WITH WHAT TO SEE IN NOVEMBER'S NIGHT SKY
THE MOON IS BY VERY MUCH OUR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR IN SPACE
YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T SEE MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE FULL MOON
BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MOORE MOON MARATHON
AND MOST OF THE OTHER MOONS WE THINK OF ARE CAPTURED FROM BODIES MOVING IN AND THEN BEING
SAMMY GLASTONBURY SAID
BUT THE BLONDES ARE BETTER
AND I HAVE DONE SINCE I WAS LITTLE
AND THEN IT CHANGED TO
I SOLD ONE RECENTLY
IT'S A SHOP DISPLAY
IT IS IT MIGHT BE CONTINENTAL
IT REMINDS ME OF A FRENCH OR BELGIAN DESIGN
BEING ANNOUNCED ON THAT RADIO
IT'S A ONE PRICE ONLY
A LITTLE BIRDIE TOLD ME THAT YOU SPENT PRACTICALLY NOTHING
AND OF ITS TYPE
BUT WILL IT MAKE IT
ON A REALLY GOOD DAY
AND YOU GAVE SEVENTY FIVE POUNDS TO CATHERINE SOUTHERN
STRIKE IT ON THE END AND
YEAH BETWEEN THIRTY AND FIFTY
I WOULD SAY THIS TEAM HAVE DONE EXTREMELY WELL
LET'S GO AND DO IT
I MOVED INTO NORTHAMPTONSHIRE ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AGO AND WENT TO CHURCH
AND I MET A LOT OF LOVELY PEOPLE THERE
AND THEY DO ACTIVITIES LIKE CANOEING AND ABSEILING
AND RAFT BUILDING
AND WE DO NEED TO COMMIT THINGS
I KNOW WHICH I WOULD PREFER TO BE TAKING HOME
YOU KNOW YOU WOULD SELL IT AND YOU WOULD PROBABLY MAKE A SMALL PROFIT OUT OF IT
I WOULD BE FAIRLY SURE OF IT
AND IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING
SOMETHING WITH AN ENERGY
GEORGE AND HENRY ELKINGTON IN
INCLUDING CHARLES ROBERT ASHBY
PATENTED AN ELECTROPLATING PROCESS
THE BIG QUESTION FOR OUR TEAMS OVER AT THE AUCTION IS WHAT SORT OF PROFIT ARE THEY GOING TO BE
YOU'RE STILL MINUS TEN
YOUR MINUS TWENTY EIGHT
AMERICAN DROP DI
SO I DON'T BREAK MANY
THE SECRET DRAWER
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT
THE PENWORK BOX SHOULD DO WELL
BUT THERE ARENT MANY BOOKS HERE TODAY
ARE WE ALL DONE
WITH ALL THESE ELABORATE ELEMENTS
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
NOW FOR THE BLUES
IF SHE MAKES THAT
JUST BEFORE I REVEAL
THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE PROFIT THERE
DOES THAT MEAN REALLY WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO PUT ON IT IS TEN TO TWENTY POUNDS
AND IN THAT TIME THE HOUSE HAD A SORT OF BIG MAKE OVER
THAT'S A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION
IF YOU IF THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE TOMORROW FROM BARNSLEY
A MOST INTERESTING BOOK
SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR
MAYBE VI A COMBINE HARVESTER
UM CLOCKS AND POSTCARDS
THAT SORT OF AREA
BIG NAMES LIKE WEDGWOOD
DALTON AND MINTON'S WERE ALL FOUNDED AND ESTABLISHED HERE IN STOON
I WONDER WHETHER THERE WILL BE A STORY WITH SUCH A HAPPY ENDING FOR OUR TEAMS TODAY OVER AT THE
THEN YOU REALLY NEED TO LOOK AFTER THEM
WHEN YOU GET TO CHRISTMAS TIME
AND WE'VE GOT THIS SHED
AND WE STORE LOTS OF THINGS IN IT
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
THIS IS THE WAY THEY GROW NATURALLY
SO THEY START TO DIE BACK
THAT'S THE END OF OUR LOOK AT THE LETTER A
MY FIRST INSTINCT IS TO MAKE THE CENTRE OF TOWN
GRAZING BY THE ROADSIDE
HE MANAGED TO HALF SCRAMBLE
SONS FOLLOWING FATHERS WHO FOLLOWED THEIR FATHERS
APART FROM THE MARKET WANTING QUALITY
THERE'S ALSO A BUYERS COMMISSION
IT CAN BE REPLACED
THE REST BEING MADE UP OF COPPER
I THINK THIS WILL WILL SELL
BECAUSE OF ITS WEIGHT
SIZE THE MORE I LIKE IT
I DO LIKE THE ARTS AND CRAFTS
BUT IT'S A QUESTION OF FINDING A ROOM THAT WILL HOUSE THAT
I'M A DARK SKY RANGER
AH WE ENCOUNTER ITEMS THAT ARE RATHER INTRIGUING BECAUSE OF THEIR SIZE
NOT JUST JAS AND GEMS BUT
BUT TINY WORKS THAT SHOW OFF EXQUISITE CRAFTSMANSHIP
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS ORDINARY
IMAGINE WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE MADE IF THEY HAD HAVE HAD THE REAL SIGNATURES OF THEM
YOU REALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN COOKING ON GAS
ANYTHING E QUESTION AGAIN
IT IS MUCH BETTER TO BUY ONE OBJECT THAT IS THE VERY BEST
SUCH AS SUNIALS
YOU HAD THE OBVIOUS SEWING COLLECTOR
BUT YOU ALSO HAD THE DOG COLLECTOR
AND IF YOU THINK
THAT COULD HAVE ADDED ANOTHER FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED POS TO THE PRIZE
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
BECAUSE THEY ARE CHARMED
I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT
WE SEE THE BEST OF WORK
SO EXAMINE IT CLOSELY
YOU THE OVAL AND YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A DAY OUT WATCHING THE CRICKET
AND AS PART OF THAT DAY OUT
MINIATURE IS ALWAYS GOOD AND
DOGS DRESSED AS POLICEMEN
LITTLE DEVIL WASN'T YOUR CUP OF TEA BUT IT DOES PROVE THAT SOMETHING INTRIGUING
DIFFERENT AND SLIGHTLY ODD WILL APPEAL TO THE RIGHT BUYER
ESPECIALLY IF THE CRAFTSMANSHIP IS AS FINE AS THAT
THE BRONZE HAS ALREADY BEEN CAST AND
BUT I ALSO WANTED TO REFLECT A PRIVATE NATURE OF THE LOT
IS BECAUSE IT'S THE FINEST AND SMOOTHEST MATERIAL
WHICH ENABLES YOU TO GET THE VERY BEST DETAIL WITH YOUR WITH YOUR PAINTS
OR EXAMPLES FOR TRAVELLING SALESMAN TO SHOW THE CLIENT ON THE ROAD
OR MAYBE IT WAS JUST A CABINET MAKER SHOWING OFF HIS SKILLS
I'M IN MY SPIRITUAL HOME
AND I'M REALLY EXCITED
WHAT WOULD IT HAVE FELT LIKE
THE PROBLEM IS THAT I HAVE A HUGE CONSIGNMENT OF STONES THAT I EXPORTED OFFICIALLY TO THIS
WHERE THE GREATEST CLARITY
SHOWS SIGNS OF WEAR
WHICH IS GREAT FOR IDENTIFYING ANTIQUE PIECES
BECAUSE THEY CAN PROVE TOO DIFFICULT TO TRANSPORT
BUT WHEN THEY DO TURN UP
OUR EXPERTS GENERALLY KNOW IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING SPECIAL
WHETHER THAT'S FURNITURE OR
DIFFICULT TO MAKE
PERHAPS IT SAVES THEM PAINTING THE WALL
IT ISN'T AN AREA OF COLLECTING THAT'S OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OLD
SO IT'S RELATIVELY MODERN AND
I THINK IT'S GOING TO GROW AND GROW AND GROW
YOU CAN HANG UP A LARGE PAINTING
THEN YOU'VE REALLY GOT THE TOTE DOUBLE
BUT SEVERAL LARGE ONES WITHIN THAT COLLECTION AND AND THAT
WE'VE FOUND SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE INTRIGUING
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT COLLECT ONE ELEMENT
WHEN WE SOLD THEM
THEY WERE THE FLAVOUR OF THE MONTH
THAT SQUARE BASE
SO YOU KNOW HE MADE THEM
LOOKING AROUND HERE
WE WILL SORT OUT THE BEST WAY TO SELL THESE
THAT'S A GREAT START
OR THE LARGEST OR THE HEAVIEST
DIG IT OUT AND BRING IT ALONG TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS
I HOPE THOSE TIPS COME IN USEFUL
AND HE WAS SO EXCITED AND HE SAID IT HAD REALLY MADE HIS DAY
I'M SURE HE SAYS THAT LOTS OF TIMES
WE WOULD BUY ACTS FROM THE UK I MEAN
IF THAT CAME INTO MY CELLROOM
I WANT TO GO HISTORICAL
NOT HALF AS SHARP
OR ASK ME TO GO AND BUY THEM
IN THE WHOLESALE AUCTION
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THEM CRASH AND BURN
IT WAS DOWN TO PAUL
THEY'RE PROBABLY ABOUT
JOIN US NEXT TIME
THEY WILL FACE TWO MINUTES ON THEIR CHOSEN SUBJECT
NO GREAT CASH PRIZE AT STAKE
THANKS FOR WATCHING GOODBYE
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A CONTENDER ON THE NEXT SERIES
THAT'S A GOOD THING
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD TIME TO BE PLANTING SHRUBS OF ANY KIND
NEW TO THIS GARDEN
AND THEIR BEAUTY
IT WAS HERE THAT FRENCH TRADERS AND CHINESE TRADERS BROUGHT THEIR WORDS
RATHER THAN DOING EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK
THAT CAN BE REALLY TOUGH
MANY OF YOU HAD EXACTLY THE SAME EXPERIENCE
IF YOU REMEMBER WE HAD THAT MISERABLE
WAYNE AND GERARDINE HEMINGWAY ARE FAMOUS FOR THE RANGE AND DISTINCTIVENESS OF THEIR
RUNNING FROM SHOES TO PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS
AND THIS SUMMER
TOO DARK OR JUST TOO MISERABLE TO DO ANYTHING OUTSIDE
I GOT BIG BEARD
ONE IN FIVE MEN IN THE UK HAS A BEARD
MAKE SURE IT'S ALL RUNNING SMOOTHLY
IS THAT SAJI AND I ARE VERY DIFFERENT
I'M THE QUINTESSENTIAL MUSLIM MAN
ANYONE CAN LOOK LIKE THAT
THIS LOOKS SMART
AS A GOOD MUSLIM
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
I'M GOING TO BE BROADCASTING TO THE NATION
WE DON'T HAVE COUGARS IN PAKISTAN
IF ONLY I TOLD HER HOW I FEEL ABOUT HER
EVEN WHEN TWO PEOPLE ARE MARRIED
THERELL BE A RUMBA
ONLY THE SECOND WOMAN IN HISTORY TO HOLD THAT OFFICE
IT WAS CHALLENGING YEAH FUN
I GOT THROWN OUT OF THE BOLIVIAN DANCING GROUP SO I THOUGHT I'D CATCH UP WITH SOME OF THE CROWD
SERVE UP SOME OF THEIR GREATEST EVER DISHES
TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED TO BE A FRENCH DISH
WHERE BETTER TO START THAN WITH RACHEL CO AND A LITTLE PARIS KITCHEN
BEST IS OVERNIGHT
MAKES IT EASIER
IN THE OLD DAYS
THEY'D PUT THEM IN THE WATER
NEVER REFRESH THEM
THIS IS A GREAT TECHNIQUE I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU TODAY TO KEEP THE NUTRIENTS INSIDE THE VEGETABLES
OR TO YOUR FAMILY
THEY TASTE OF THE ACTUAL VEGETABLE
IT'S SO HEALTHY FOR YOU
BUT UNLIKE THEM
AND YOU CAN MAKE IT YOU CAN KEEP IT IN THE FRIDGE OR THE LARDER AND USE IT WHENEVER YOU WANT TO FOR
I'M GOING TO MAKE QUEEN ALEXANDRA'S FAVOURITE SANDWICHES
I KNOW YOU'RE A BIG FAN OF ALL THESE CLASSIC CLASSICS
CHURCHILL CALLED IT THE BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC
THEY HAVE LOST NINE OF THEIR COLLEAGUES IN THE PAST YEAR
AND WHILE THIS IS FEWER THAN IN RECENT YEARS
FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES
AT HOME AND ABROAD
AND HE SAID EVERYTHING DEPENDED ON ITS OUTCOME
THE BRAVERY OF THOSE AT SEA WAS MATCHED IN THE AIR
BY THE FAMOUS DAMBUSTERS
LYING IN THE NOSE
WE PAY TRIBUTE TO ALL WHO SERVE
THE NAME GIVEN BY WINSTON CHURCHILL TO THE MOST COMPLEX NAVAL CONFLICT IN HISTORY
THE BATTLE INVOLVED ALL THREE SERVICES
I WAS NOT TERRIFIED
THEY WILL BE JOINING US IN JUST A MOMENT
WILL BE OFFICIALLY RELEASED TOMORROW
YESTERDAY WE HOSTED THE TALIBAN AND THEY DRANK OUR CUPS OF TEA
I SEE THAT AS JUST TREATING EVERYONE THE SAME
AND IN A FEW MOMENTS
WOULD YOU PLEASE GIVE HIM A VERY WARM WELCOME
THE SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE YEAR OF HER CORONATION
FOR OUR SOVEREIGN LADY
TO THE DEPARTED
AS WE WERE SETTING UP SEVEN
BUT IT IS A LINK TO HIM
YOU WERE IN AFGHANISTAN
AND YOU COME BACK YEAR AFTER YEAR
SO WE OWE A LOT
TO THOSE WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE
I WANT TO BE A CLERK SPECIAL DUTIES
BUT I DO KNOW I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M GOOD AT MATHEMATICS
THE SAME MI SAME AS MEN
WE TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY VERY VERY SERIOUSLY IN THE RIFLES
THOSE GUYS NEED OUR HELP
BECAUSE THE AVERAGE AGE OF OUR SERIOUSLY WOUNDED IS EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY SIX
THEY'VE GOT DECADES
EVER THOUGHT IT WOULD END UP LIKE THIS
ONLY TROUBLE IS
I KNOW I'M BEING PARANOID
HE MAKES ME FEEL REALLY SPECIAL
I THINK THAT WOULD BE BEST
I CAME HERE WITH THE RAMBLERS ASSOCIATION IN BATH
NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
UM WE NEED TO FIND OUT
IS THERE A PROBLEM
SOMETIMES IT MAY BE BECAUSE IT'S JUST NATURALLY SEEDING INTO THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
WHICH I HAVE HERE
DRAMATIC FLOWERS IN LATE SPRING
SO THEY'RE GREAT FOR FAIRLY DAMP AREAS
THEY'RE GROWING ALREADY
BECAUSE I WANT TO START BULB PLANTING
AND ANY TIME FROM NOW RIGHT UNTIL NOVEMBER FOR TULIPS IS FINE
BUT BEFORE THEN
LET'S MOVE ON FROM FLOWERS AND ONTO OUR NEXT B
THESE TWIGS HAVE BEEN STACKED UP INSIDE THE BOX TO ATTRACT BENEFICIAL INSECTS
AND YOU CAN SAVE MONEY BY LOOKING AT THINGS WITH FRESH EYES
HERE'S A REALLY GOOD WAY TO DEAL WITH THEM IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR GARDEN
AND STAYING ON THE SUBJECT
THE OLDER BRANCHES
THAT TASTES NOT BAD AT ALL
HE'S NIPPED OVER TO FRANCE AND SPAIN
THEY MIGRATE FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT MOST OTHER BIRD SPECIES DO HARD WEATHER AND SHORTAGE OF
WHY HAS BARRY DESERTED ME
CAN BE PRETTY UNPLEASANT FOR BIRDS
AND ALSO THERE'S A VERY SHORT DAY LENGTH THERE
SO EVEN IF THERE'S PLENTY OF FOOD
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FORAGING TIME FOR OLAF TO FIND IT AND AS A CONSEQUENCE IT'S MUCH BETTER FOR HIM
AND I'M GOING TO BE CELEBRATING THAT CENTENARY WITH A COUPLE OF FIRST TIME DAIRY FARMERS
KEEN TO MEXICO OF LIVING OFF THE LAND
THEY SAY A JOB SHARED IS A JOB HALVED
BUT WHAT ABOUT IF YOU'RE BEING HELPED BY HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
BUT THIS KIND OF CITIZEN SCIENCE IS BEING USED TO TACKLE EVERYTHING FROM ASH DIEBACK
TO BIRD NUMBERS
TO INVASIVE LADYBIRDS
BUT DOES IT REALLY WORK
IT WAS SO BAD THAT CATTLE STARVED AND EVEN DIED
THERE'S A WHOLE NEW RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO DO THEIR BIT FOR THE
THERE'S SOME REAL SCIENCE GOING ON HERE
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL OF
I THINK IT'S A GREAT WAY TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED IN SCIENCE
AND IT'S A GREAT WAY FOR US TO GET DATA THAT WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO GET HOLD OF
BUT HOW DO YOU GET INTO THE FARMING BUSINESS IF YOU'RE NOT DUE TO INHERIT LAND OR YOU DOG
WE'VE CERTAINLY BEEN HAMMERED HARD WITH WEATHER
THE TVS BEEN A BIG IMPACT
THERE'S A GREAT COMMUNITY SPIRIT HE JUST DESCRIBED IN FARMING
IT DEFINITELY IS CHALLENGING
AND IT'S VERY KEY
WHAT WE'VE DONE
SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO BUILD A THREE D MODEL TO ENABLE VISITORS
TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE
BECAUSE IT'S SO PRECIOUS BUT SO FRAGILE
BOTH IN TERMS OF TIME AND GEOGRAPHY
BUT THE MODEL MAP HERE ON CANCK CHASE SERVES AS AN IMPORTANT MEMORIAL TO THOSE FROM ALL SIDES
ALL THOSE MILES AWAY IN BELGIUM
SO IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT IT IS
AND THOSE RECORDS ARE IMPORTANT
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL
SO THEY DON'T REALLY SMASH UP THE MOUNTAIN
PRETTY REMOTE SPOT
BUT IN TERMS OF THEIR EFFECT ON ON ON SUCH A SENSITIVE ENVIRONMENT AS THIS
THERE'S A FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO HECTARE SITE THAT'S MADE UP OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT HABITAT TYPES
YOU WERE THE SAME
LUCY AND LITTLE RE ARE PROOF THAT COUNTY FARMS ARE NEEDED ACROSS THE COUNTRY
GIVING PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THEIR OWN WAY IN THE FARMING WORLD
AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO DO IT THAN WITH THE COUNTRYFILE CALENDAR FOR TWENTY FOURTEEN
IT IS PACKED FULL OF THE VERY BEST PHOTOS FROM THIS YEAR'S COMPETITION
IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON GETTING OUT AND ABOUT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE IN THE WEEK AHEAD
THEN YOU WILL NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER HAS IN STORE
AT THE AGE OF SEVEN
TAKING PICTURES OF HIS BELOVED HOME
I LOOKED UP AT THE CLOCK
BUT I ACTUALLY CAN'T REMEMBER
IT'S THE WRONG TIME
IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE
WE'RE CELEBRATING THE CENTENARY OF THE BIRTH OF BENJAMIN BRITTEN
AND I'LL BE WITH SOME OF THE COUNTY'S BEST LOVED BUT RAREST FARM ANIMALS
THE MAGNIFICENT SUFFOLK PUNCH HEAVY HOLE
I COULD DO FOR YOU MY WORLD FAMOUS SUPPLYOLD AND KNIFE THROWING
WELL THEY'VE ALL PLAYED HERE
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE MAYHEM
I MOVED TO CORNWALL IN SEVENTY TWO
ONE VERY BADLY BROKEN ANDENDED WITHOUT
IT'S A LONDON PLAQUE
I WISH THIS WAS A BOOK
ACTUALLY THIS IS MY HOME TERRITORY BECAUSE
I AM A CHESHIGO
WHICH IS ALSO MEDICAL
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE THAT ACTUALLY GRAPHICALLY SHOWS AN INJURY
ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO SELL
IT'S BEEN VERY HIGH
THE NEXT MORNING
MY MOTHER WAS REALLY TERRIFIED
I REMEMBER MY MOTHER'S FACE WAS REALLY TERRIFIED
THE BALTIC AND CANADA
THEY'RE VERY WELCOMING
THE MORE OBSERVANT AMONG YOU
WHAT A SUGGESTION
HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN ME TO DECEIVE ANYONE
WITH THIS I KNOW THE TYPE OF GIRL I WANT TO WORK IN OUR CAFE
AND IT IS NOT OUR CAFE
AND PLEASE FORGIVE ME
FOR SERVICE IN NORTH AFRICA
I WORKED IN A CIRCUS
SHE WAS A GANG LEADER IN PARIS
IN FOUR MINUTES
WE MUST GRAB EVERY MOMENT OF HAPPINESS
I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU CONFIDENTIALLY
NEVER MENTION THE INVASION OR THE FACT THAT THE COLONEL TOLD YOU ABOUT IT
SHE IS DOING PRIVATE THINGS
HOW IS THE NEW GIRL
MY WIFE'S AUNTIE
WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT
SHE WILL BE DELIGHTED
AND I DO HAVE REGULAR CONTACT WITH HER
ACTUALLY WHICH IS THE DORSET COAST
SORT OF ASSOCIATED WITH RYE
BUT BEFORE THE AUCTION GETS UNDER WAY
THE MAN WITH ALL THE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
LET'S SEE WHAT HE'S GOT TO SAY ABOUT SOME OF OUR ITEMS BUT
WHICH I'M GUESSING IS SOMETHING BETWEEN EIGHTEEN TWENTY
THERE WAS ONLY TWO OR THREE IN THE BOOK
I CHECKED AS WELL
I'M SURE IT WOULD BE TWO
I REALLY DO THINK THAT'S IT'S GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY
DAMAGE ALWAYS DOES
BUT IT IS WORTH A COUPLE OF GRAND IF IT WAS IN A GALLERY AND
I THINK ANYBODY WOULD PAY THAT SORT OF MONEY FOR IT
THIS IS SOMETHING FOR THE ACADEMICS
THAT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ME
IT'S IT'S ALL VERY SOFT AND VERY DELICATE
AND THEY READ THESE SYMBOLS
HE DIED IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FOUR
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
WHEN THEY THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SORT OF EQUIPMENT OR THE COMPUTERS THAT WE'VE GOT NOW TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THIS
AND THEY'VE SET IT UP TO JUST GIVE US
TECHNICALLY MUCH MUCH MORE ACCOMPLISHED THAN HIS FATHER
WHEN YOU THINK WHAT'S BEEN ACHIEVED HERE
IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE
WHAT'S IT WORTH
NOW I HAVE NO DOOR
WHAT TO BLOW UP
NEXT TIME YOU GO TO THE CHEMIST
YOU HAVE GOT TO HELP ME
YOU GERMANS YOU LIKE A THE WAR
PLACING IT BETWEEN MY TEETH
IN THIS VASE IS A POWERFUL GESTAPO MICROPHONE
AFTER ALL THE WAR IS OVER
WE ARE TRYING TO CONTACT LONDON
WELCOME TO FLOG IT
WHEN SHE'S NOT THERE
ITS THE UNION JACK
WE'VE CERTAINLY GOT OUR WORK CUT OUT TO DO IN THE HIGH STREET
THE MAN WIELDING THE GAVEL IS AUCTIONEER SIMON BROWN
LET'S GO INSIDE BEFORE THE SALE STARTS
POUND THAT'S A GOOD VALUATION
AND YOUVE GOT THIS PIECE OF TROY
WHICH WAS THE HOME OF ARTIST SIR STANLEY SPENCER
AND HE USED MANY OF THE LOCAL CHARACTERS AND SCENES FROM THIS VILLAGE AS INSPIRATION AND A BACKDROP FOR
VIRTUALLY CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD
AND SPENCER GREW UP HERE ALONGSIDE HIS TEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS
SHE'S IN HER BACK GARDEN
WHICH IS A REALLY LIVELY AND COLOURFUL EVENT
JUST AS IT WAS IN SPENCER'S DAY
AND THIS IS WHERE HE GOT THE INSPIRATION AND THE SETTING FOR FOR THAT BEAUTIFUL PAINTING
I BOUGHT THEM MYSELF
MAYBE NEXT TIME
IF OUR EXPERTS PICK YOUR ITEM
LOG IT THEN COME ALONG TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS
AT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
IT IS NOT USUAL TO FIND ME IN BED
WISHES TO MARRY ME
BUT I AM SUFFERING FROM NERVOUS EXHAUSTION
THE MAN WHO WISHES TO MARRY MY WIFE
A LITTLE BETTER
WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE
AND ONE OF YOURS
FOAM FLYING FROM THE MOUTH
CLATTERING OVER THE COBBLES
APART FROM THE SATISFACTION HE OBTAINS FROM WEARING GIRLS CLOTHES
I MUST WARN HIM AT ONCE
AH YOU COULD NOT HAVE COME AT A BETTER TIME
IT WAS PASSED ON TO ME IN THE NINETEEN FIFTY S BY MY MOTHER BECAUSE MY SISTER HAD
INVADED BY THE VIKINGS
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DIVINE
WHEN SHE CAME BACK
YOU'VE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE
I WOULD PUT A RESERVE OF SIXTY
THE GAME GREW IN POPULARITY
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
WE'VE HAD SOME HIGHS AND LOWS
I WANT TO EXPLORE IF
JUST LIKE THE DOCTOR
AS THE DOCTOR KNOWS
MARCHING EAST TO WEST
THEN H FOUR WOULD READ FIVE PM GREENWICH MEAN TIME WHEN THE SUN IS DIRECTLY
EQUALS SEVENTY FIVE DEGREES WEST OF GREENWICH
TRADE AND TRAVEL WERE NO LONGER A LOTTERY
DON'T HAVE THAT FREEDOM
WE HAVE MORE FREEDOM THAN YOU MIGHT THINK
FARADAY AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERE INTRIGUED
BUT PUZZLING AS WELL
TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS
BUT ACCORDING TO MAXWELL
THE BEAM OF LIGHT BO IN BETWEEN THE MIRRORS
AND YOU COULD USE THAT
THIS IS WHAT EINSTEIN HAD DISCOVERED
NINE FOUR PERCENT THE SPEED OF LIGHT FOR FIVE YEARS ACCORDING TO HIS
THAT'S A SILENT
INTELLIGENT LIFE SOMEWHERE BEYOND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
ONE OF THE GREAT MYSTERIES
THIS IS KNOWN AS THE FERMI PARADOX
IF THEY WERE OUT THERE
SO THE SEARCH MUST PROCEED WITHOUT PHYSICALLY TRAVELLING BEYOND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
BY CAPTURING LIGHT FROM DISTANT STAR SYSTEMS
USING AN ARRAY OF TELESCOPES BOTH ON THE GROUND AND IN ORBIT
THE UNIVERSE IS FILLED WITH ALIENS
BUT THEY STILL WON'T ALLOW US TO RESOLVE FERMI'S PARADOX
BECAUSE THESE CHEMICAL FINGERPRINTS WON'T DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SIMPLE
FROM THE TINIEST MOBILE PHONE TO THE LARGEST POWER STATION
WE PRODUCE MORE HEAT
THEN THEY COULD CLAIM EVIDENCE
NOT ONLY FOR COMPLEX LIFE BUT FOR A MACHINE BUILDING
ALWAYS GETS MY VOTE
THE DOCTOR HAS COMPLETE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT ON THE MAP
HE CAN GO ANYWHERE
THERE'S ONE AT THE HEART OF THE TARDIS
THIS EVENT I WANT TO VISIT
AT LEAST IN PRINCIPLE
EVEN IF THEY FAIL
IS CAUSED BY THE MASS OF THE BLACK HOLE ITSELF
THE WALKING OF SPACE AND TIME
SO SIT BACK AND ENJOY AS OUR EXPERTS LET YOU IN ON THEIR TRADE SECRET
ALTHOUGH WE DO SEE A GREAT DEAL OF THOSE ON THE SHOW
ANYTHING TO DO WITH DOCTORS
IT'S THE FACT THAT THEY CAN DRESS AN ENVIRONMENT
HE BUT IF YOU HAVE THAT FORETHOUGHT TO KEEP THEM
IT HAS TO HAVE AN APPEAL
WHEN ERIC CAME ALONG TO THE VALUATION DAY AT EXMOUTH
HE HAD A MAHOGANY BOX WITH HIM AND I ASSUMED IT CONTAINED A MICROSCOPE BUT
IT HAD A MINIATURE LACE MACHINE IN
THE LIKE OF WHICH I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
AND PEOPLE LIKE GADGETS
WATCH THIS SPACE
EVERYBODY'S GOT AT LEAST ONE AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE GOT TWO
AND THEY STARTED OFF AS HUGE GREAT BIG THINGS
WITH BATTERIES THIS BIG
I THINK IN FIFTY OR ONE HUNDRED YEARS TIME
I WON'T BE HERE IF IT'S NOT RIGHT
LOOKING AT THE WOOD
SO IT'S GOING TO BE A SPECIES OF EBONY OR ROSEWOOD
AND THAT'S VERY HARD WEARING
PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE APPRENTICE PIECES
I DON'T KNOW IN THIS INSTANCE
MAYBE IT WAS A TRADE PIECE TO TAKE TO FACTORIES
TO TRY AND SELL THE FULL SIZE MODELS
FILLING IN SOME TIME DOWN IN THE WORKSHOP BY BUILDING HIS OWN MODEL
I DON'T THINK WE'LL EVER FIND OUT THE TRUTH
THE WORST IN THE WORLD
BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT
I'M SURE WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE
THAT'S BECAUSE THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY
IT'S CUT IT'S EASY TO WORK WITH
IT DOESN'T BLUNT YOUR TOOLS SO MUCH
I VISITED THE POOL MUSEUM IN DORSET AND WENT ON TO VISIT THE POTTERY
THE STUDIO POTTERY ALONG THE ROAD
I WAS SHOWN ROUND BY ALAN WHITE
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A POINT
LOOKING AT THESE OTHER PEOPLE
HE WAS STANDING BEHIND ME
SOLID ARMS ROUND ME
AND ITS STORY RESONATES WITH ELIZABETH TALBOT
AND IT REMINDS YOU OF FLOWER POWER
AND I USED TO COME HERE WHEN I WAS IN MY TEENAGE YEARS FOR FAMILY HOLIDAYS
THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR NAME ON IT
I KNOW WHAT I'D LIKE FOR CHRISTMAS
I'D LIKE A THING TO HANG FROM MY WAIST WITH AH A NEEDLE CASE
IN A DOMESTIC SITUATION
AND WHEN WE SEE IT OUT
IT JUST AMUSED ME
A CHATT GENERALLY WAS USED FROM THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY INTO THE EARLY TWENTIETH
IT'S OF SOCIAL INTEREST
WE'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT AND IT GIVES US AN INSIGHT INTO THE LIVES OF OUR
OR THE HOUSEKEEPER
YOU WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT OBJECT
GENERALLY DESIGNED FOR WOMEN AS LABOUR SAVING DEVICES IN THE HOME
AN AIDE MEMOIR OR NOTEPAD
DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT BUT
AND YOU SEE A LOT OF THAT IN THE CHINESE STUFF THAT WAS MADE FOR EXPORT
SOME OF THESE ITEMS CAN LOOK A LITTLE BIT HEATH ROBINSON
YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT SORT OF THING BEING DISCOVERED AND THEY'VE TAKEN IT BACK TO SCOTLAND AND SAID LOOK
BUT OTHERS CAN HAVE REAL COLLECTORS' APPEAL
IS TO GET THE BEST PLACE POSSIBLE FOR THE VENDOR
SHE WAS ABLE TO TELL ME THAT THE VINAIGRETTE WAS MADE BY NATHANIEL MILLS
WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU AT ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS
AND JOIN US AGAIN SOON FOR MORE TRADE SECRETS
VERY COLLECTABLE BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING YOU CAN PUT IN A GLASS CABINET AND SHOW OFF
HAD IT BEEN A FEW YEARS EARLIER AND BEEN VICTORIAN
YOU'RE NO LONGER DOING THE UK VERSION OF THE SHOW
MY FAVOURITE DANCE IS THE QUICKSTEP
INDEPENDENTLY OF EACH OTHER
AS DID MILLIONS
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
NO ONE CAN GO NEAR
AND I AM ABOUT TO LEG IT TO THE SPANISH BORDER
WE'VE GOT PROBABLY NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNERS
WITH ME JOHN HUMPHRIES
WELL THEN THERE WILL BE A TIE BREAK
SO PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
WE DID HAVE THAT REALLY COLD SPELL IN SPRING WHEN THE WHOLE GARDEN SEEMED TO BE LOCKED STILL
SHE IS MAKING NEW PLANTS
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR FRAMEWORK
NO HOTTER THAN THAT
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL NEST THIS YEAR
AND LAST SUMMER
RACHEL WENT TO VISIT THE GARDEN OF JULIAN CLARY
IF YOU HAVE NEIGHBOURS
IF YOU'VE GOT A GREEN BIN FOR RECYCLING
YOU CAN PUT MATERIAL IN THERE
OR THE BACTERIA THAT'S CAUSING THE HARM
AND YOU CAN PUT THE ASH ON THE GARDEN
BUT WE'RE STARTING WITH RICE AND A DISH MADE UP OF NOT ONE
ALL COOKED UP FOR US BY SOPHIE DAHL
I'M GOING TO MAKE THE RAVIOLI DOUGH
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THEM DOWN AS FANS OF THE RACE
GETTING STRONGER AND STRONGER
AND THAT IS WHEN
THE SCIENTISTS HAVE FOUND OUT
IT PUTS OUT THIS SUBSTANCE
THAT WE NEED IN OUR BODIES
I'M REALLY IMPRESSED
I REALLY HAD NO IDEA HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO FORCE THROUGHBARB
IT'S NOT A SCIENTIFIC PROCESS AT ALL
EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON THE SKILL AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GROWER
BUT I'M REALLY PLEASED THAT THEY'VE MANAGED TO GET PDO STATUS
A BIG THANK YOU TO ALL OUR CHEFS TODAY
SO IT'S NOT ALL BAD
VERY LONG STORY
PLANNING UNCLE JACK'S BIRTHDAY
NOTHING STACKS UP
IS THAT WHAT THEY WANT
HE'S GONE FOR A LITTLE WALK
WE GET THE POLICE INVOLVED
THAT'S WHY THE MS SOCIETY IS THERE
FIGHTING TO HELP PEOPLE WITH MS KEEP CONTROL OF THEIR LIVES
SENSITIVITY TO HOT OR COLD
THE MS SOCIETY UNDERSTANDS THE PRESSURES YOU FIND YOURSELF UNDER
AND THAT'S WHY THEY OFFER A WHOLE RANGE OF SERVICES TO HELP FROM A FREE PHONE HELPLINE TO A NETWORK
WHETHER IT'S THE HELPLINE
GRANTS FOR FAMILY BREAKS OR THEIR SUPPORT FOR GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH TO FIND A CURE
TO FIND OUT WHERE TO DONATE
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT INTERNET ACCESS
IF YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH THE FIRST TIME
PLEASE KEEP TRYING
QUEEN ANITA MANNING AND HER PRINCE CHARMING
WE'VE GOT A MASSIVEQUEUE THAT SNAKES ALL AROUND THE CORNER
IT'S NOT THE STANDARD PRATT MARK
THE BIBLE OF MARKS
HAPPY TO DO THAT
AND IT'S HOME OF HENRY ADAMS AUCTIONEERS LET'S GO
IT'S THE WHOLE LOOK
I'M SO SURPRISED
POUNDS I'VE JUST BEEN JOINED BY ROBERT AND HIS WIFE ANNIE
RICHARD LANCELING GREEN
TO LEAVE HIS ENTIRE COLLECTION OF ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE MEMORABILIA TO PORTSMOUTH CITY COUNCIL
THERE'S BEEN PLENTY OF UNPACKING SO FAR BUT THERE'S MORE TO DO
WHICH I'VE REALLY LOVED
ON THE VALUATION DAY
THE AUCTION HAS LITERALLY JUST FINISHED
REACHING THE FOUR POINTS OF THE COMPASS
THE SMILE ON JEANETTE'S FACE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THIS WORLD
SELLING FOR A STAGGERING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POUNDS
THAT MADE THE NEWS
HE GOES TO IRELAND
WAVING AND SHOUTING
HE WAS A LOVELY MAN
DROVE ME DOWN TO BIRCH GROVE
OF COURSE DETECTIVE SERGEANT ETHERIDGE
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT
PLEASED TO MEET YOU
BUT I THINK IT MUST HAVE HAD HIS NAME ON THE DOOR
LOOKED IN MACMILLAN'S
I SUPPOSE I DIDN'T LOOK AT MY WATCH
BUT I SUPPOSE AFTER
WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND MY MOMENT OF GLORY WAS OVER
REMAINS A CLOSELY GUARDED SECRET
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S DISCUSS DISCUSSED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
WHICH WAS A VERY NOISY AND
HOW MANY H BOMBS WOULD IT TAKE
AND YOU WERE SO AWARE AND I REMEMBER THINKING AT THE TIME THIS WAS A BLOW AGAINST DEMOCRACY IT WAS
DALLAS HAD HIM FOR MURDER OF THE POLICE OFFICER
SO A FARM LIKE THIS
OR SINGLEFI PAYMENT
GOING INTO THE NEW SYSTEM
THE AREA PAYMENT ON OUR HILL LAND COULD BE FORTY
FIFTY EUROS WE'RE NOT SURE YET
IT AVERAGES MONEY OUT
FOR HILL FARMERS THAT'S A BIT TOUGH
SO THAT THOSE THAT ARE THE MOST ACTIVE
AH THE FIGURES ARE ALL IN EUROS
AND IT'S THERE TOO THAT THEY DECIDE HOW MUCH EACH MEMBER STATE WILL GET
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PER FARM IN SCOTLAND
HISTORICALLY THEY'VE TENDED TO HAVE LOWER PAYMENTS PER HECTARE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE LAND IS LESS
BUT AS I SAID WE'VE GOT TO BE FAIR TO ALL OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTS OF THE UK
UM BECAUSE THE FARM FARM UNITS TEND TO BE LARGER
BECAUSE THE FARMING COMMUNITY IS QUITE A CLOSE COMMUNITY AND WITH SONS COMING ON
IF WE CAN GET THROUGH THAT YOU
PROBABLY THERE'S NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME TO FARM
KNOWS NO ONE TO TAKE OVER IT
IT'S TIME TO CUT THE APRON STRINGS
SO IT BECOMES WHAT'S CALLED THE PRICKLE FACTOR
SO I I WASN'T SURE WHAT I WANTED TO DO
THEN I'LL BE GOING ON TO MANAGE FARMS AND CARRY ON STUFF
I THINK I'VE I'VE SEEN PLENTY OF THE COUNTRY PLENTY OF THE WORLD
SO YEAH HOME FROM HOME
SO IT'S ALL ROCK
SO WE'VE GOT A BIG MOUNTAIN FENCE
SO WE'LL GET A CONTRACTOR TO DO THAT
PEOPLE PUT MONEY IN TOWARDS THE FARM
SO THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE WHAT'S COME OUT OF IT SO
SO IT'S NOT AH NOT SO MUCH PRESSURE
IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT
BECAUSE THAT IS THE THEME THIS YEAR OF THE COUNTRYFILE CALENDAR
SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS AGO
ALWAYS COMPLAINED ABOUT IT
ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION
HE WENT BACK AND BACK
AND WORST OF ALL
YOU KNOW SHE WAS REALLY VERY
MOVING ALL THE TIME
NOTHING STAYS STILL
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
THE FIRST ENGLISHMAN TO SAIL RIGHT ROUND THE WORLD
AND FORTUNE HE DID MAKE
WHEN HE CAME BACK
SHIP LADEN WITH GOLD
HE DID WHAT ALL BUCCANEERS
EVEN THE MODERN ONES
WHAT SOME PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS A BIT EMBARRASSED BY IS WHAT THE REAL DRAKE WAS LIKE
THEY FORGET THAT HE WAS A MAN OF HIS TIME
HE WENT ASHORE AND DESTROYED VILLAGES AND FORTS
IN THE BAY OF PANAMA
HIS SAILORS BURIED HIM IN A LEAD COFFIN AND MADE A NOTE OF EXACTLY WHERE THE COFFIN LAY
AND I WAS INVOLVED IN A MAD SCHEME A FEW YEARS BACK
TO TRY AND RECOVER THIS COFFIN WITH DRAKE'S BODY
LIKE A TRUE PIRATE
LADEN WITH TREASURE
THE MAN WHO WROTE ROBINSON CRUSOE
THEY CAME DOWN HERE
AND TOOK THEM CAPTIVE TO TURN THEM INTO SLAVES IN NORTH AFRICA
IT'S NOT BRAVERY
WHICH FINALLY ESTABLISHED BRITAIN'S COMMAND OF THE SEAS
AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
IT WAS OUR IDEA TO HAVE A NAVY AT LEAST TWICE THE SIZE OF ANY OF OUR RIVALS
AND THIS PLACE WAS DESIGNED TO INSPIRE THE OFFICERS TO RUN IT
FROM HEAD TO TOE
I LOOKED LIKE AN ARMADILLO
YOU DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO FIND ANYBODY TO WORK WITH HIM
AND HE CHALLENGES YOU
WE DIDN'T PRESUME TO WRITE THE SCRIPT OURSELVES
I'VE TRAVELLED THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF BRITAIN AND I'VE MET SOME DIVERSE AND FASCINATING
HE DIDN'T GET THE BUS
AND HE'S ALWAYS PICKING UP GARY BELLAMY
IT WAS ALWAYS LIKE
I THINK WE'VE LOST THAT
WHAT ABOUT THE JUBILEE
LET'S JUST KEEP MOVING
AND SOMETIMES VERY SIMPLE LINES FOR FELIX
WHICH IS THE MUSLIM GREETING BUT
I KNOW YOU'VE NOT BEEN WELL BECAUSE I HEARD ABOUT YOUR BACK
SO WHAT'S GOING ON
AND THAT'S WHEN HE SAID
GOT VERY EMOTIONAL
I'M MOST DREADFULLY SORRY
I CAN'T PLAY THE FOOL IF HE'S BEING YOU KNOW VERY
AND ACHIEVE THOSE VITAL RESULTS LATER AT AUCTION
AND THEN YOU'RE DONE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YOU'D HAVE SOME SEALING WAX
AND ON THAT BASIS
AND HE KILLED HIM BY SPLITTING OPEN HIS HEAD WITH A MEAT CLEAVER
HE HIT HIM SO HARD IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS HEAD
BUT ONE NEIGHBOUR A PERSON CALLED ASRI WENT ABOUT TELLING THE TALE OF THIS
AND HE GOT SUED BY SIR THOMAS
AND THE COURT HELD THAT SIR THOMAS DIDN'T DO IT
AND ALL WILL BE REVEALED IN A MINUTE
MICHELLE OF THE RESISTANCE
TRY TO RELAX MORE
WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU ARE VERY KIND
THE MAJOR MASTER FORGER
I MEAN HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN THIS AREA
SO AS A COLLECTION
FIFTY ONE WEEKS OF THE YEAR
HE'S GOING TO BE WIELDING THE GAVEL
THE BOTTOM'S MARKED WITH EVERYTHING
SOMEONE WHO DOES LIKE HIM IS OUR EXPERT JAMES
IT'S TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD
MY FAVOURITE WOOD
THE BETTER THE COLOUR
COUNTY HOME OF HORATIO
WE GO THERE WE'VE BEEN THERE QUITE A FEW TIMES
SEE WHEN I CAME OUT OF THAT
WE LADIES HAVE CERTAIN ADVANTAGES
OUTSIDE A FRENCH RESTAURANT
I DECLARE THAT TIME'S UP
WHY DON'T WE CHECK OUT WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
THE LONG GALLERY
EXCEPT THAT OUT OF THE HAM ARCHIVES
AH SHOULD YOU WANT TO
SO IT WON'T BE A LOT OF MONEY BUT
HE'S THE MAN WITH ALL THE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
THAT'S QUITE NICE
I HOPE WE GET THE TOP END OF THAT ESTIMATE
IT'S THAT CHOCOLATE BOOK OF NURSERY RHYMES BROUGHT IN BY ROSALIND
NOT A GREAT DEAL OF VALUE BUT
LET'S PUT SOME PRESSURE ON YOUNG WILL
OR WILL WE ECLIPSE THAT
SOME MIXED RESULTS SO FAR
WE COULDN'T PREDICT THAT
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM BUT
BUT I DO BELIEVE IN THEM
RIGHT ON THE RESERVE
SO IT'S A REALLY NICE QUALITY ITEM
THERE'S NO EXCUSE YOU CAN GET THE DETAILS OF UP AND COMING DATES ON THE WEBSITE JUST
THEY'D ALSO BEEN RECRUITED AS FOOT SOLDIERS IN THE GREAT IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN
SHOULD LEAD THE WORLD
SO I DREW MYSELF THE REPRESENTATIVE OF AN INDIVIDUAL IN DESPAIR
IF IT HAD BEEN ME
IT DEVOTED RATHER MORE ATTENTION TO A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY
EVEN BEFORE THE FIRST BOND FILM HAD BEEN RELEASED
THE BOOKS WERE ENORMOUSLY POPULAR
SELLING MORE THAN ONE
AS FLEMING HIMSELF PUT IT
ALTHOUGH ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE BACKGROUND AND DETAIL ARE OUTSIDE
ALL THE DULL THINGS OF LIFE
BOND LIVES IN FASHIONABLE CHELSEA
LEMUS IN RUNDOWN BAYSWATER
MORAL PHILOSOPHERS MEASURING EVERYTHING THEY DO AGAINST THE WORD OF GOD OR KARL MARX
ALEC LEMUS HAS LEFT THE ETHICAL HIGH GROUND FAR BEHIND
WAS THE DILEMMA THAT BRITAIN WAS FACING
THE MORAL QUANDARY AT THE HEART OF THE COLD WAR
IN MANY PEOPLE'S EYES
IT WAS THE YOUNGER MAN
WHO WAS REALLY CALLING THE SHOTS AND THAT HE HIMSELF WAS BASICALLY JUST A JUNIOR PARTNER
HE PROMISED ON THE TWENTY SIXTH OF OCTOBER
BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING OF A DRASTIC NATURE
BUT A MONTH LATER
IN A SECRET MEETING WITH HIS INTELLIGENCE CHIEFS
ACCORDING TO SIR KENNETH STRONG
THE DIRECTOR OF THE JOINT INTELLIGENCE BUREAU
ACCORDING TO STRONG
THE AMERICANS HAD SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE
SENDING THEIR BOMBERS EAST TO HIT THE KEY SOVIET MISSILE SITES
FOR STRONG FEARED
THE ATTACK HAD FAILED
THEN THE RUSSIANS WOULD HAVE HIT BACK
UNLEASHING NUCLEAR ARMAGEDDON
WAS THE POINT THAT WITH THE PROPER PREPARATION
YOU COULD GET THROUGH WORLD WAR THREE ALMOST UNSCATHED
BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD
WATKINS WAS DETERMINED
THAT NOBODY WAS GOING TO DISCREDIT HIS FILM ON THE GROUNDS OF INACCURACY
FOR THE POWER AND INTEGRITY OF WATKINS'S FILM
AND THEY ALSO FELT THEY HAD AN OBLIGATION AS AN INDEPENDENT BROADCASTER NOT TO BE COWED BY THE
BUT THEY WERE FACING WHAT THEY SAW AS A GENUINE MORAL DILEMMA
THEY THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE SERVED BY NOT SHOWING A FILM THAT MIGHT UNDERMINE THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT
THAT MIGHT UNDERMINE SUPPORT FOR SOMETHING THEY BELIEVED WAS KEEPING US SAFE FROM THE THREAT OF
THE FACILITIES WERE SECOND TO NONE
THE FAMILIES HERE ACTUALLY HAD A MUCH BETTER DEAL THAN A LOT OF THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES BACK
WEST GERMANY AND JAPAN
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY SUCCESSIVE BRITISH GOVERNMENTS FELT THEY HAD TO SPEND THEIR MONEY AS THEY
IT IS TEMPTING TO WONDER WHAT BRITAIN WOULD BE LIKE IF THEY HAD CHOSEN DIFFERENTLY
THEY ALSO ISSUED SOME ORIGINALS
EVEN A LITTLE BIT IRREVERENT
THEN IT WAS PLAY FOR TODAY
NO SCRIPT WAS TOO WORTHY
HOWARD HAS A SENIOR LECTURESHIP THERE
HE IS STILL ACTIVE IN THE TOWNS RADICAL CAUSES AND IN THE RADICAL JOURNALS
WHERE HE WRITES OFTEN
FOR MANY PEOPLE
THE NEW TRENDY LEFTIES OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTY S WERE RIPE FOR SATIRE
AND GIVEN THE COLD WAR TENSIONS OF THE DAY
AND UNDER THEIR LEADERSHIP
SALLY BY ERIC CLAPTON
THE GATES ARE OPEN FOR PETERBOROUGH'S FESTIVAL OF ANTIQUES WHICH IS JUST AS WELL
WE'VE GOT TWO HAPPILY MARRIED COUPLES
THEN IT'S HEATED TO GIVE IT THIS SORT OF MILKY
WELL DONE WITH THE MATHS
NOW FOR THE BLUES AND
IF THERE AREN'T
BECAUSE WILL THE TEAMS GO WITH IT OR NOT
SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED IS THE ESTIMATE
THAT'S JUST ABOUT OK
THE BIG TRICK IS HOW WELL THE DIRK DOES
NO FURTHER INTEREST
ONE THING I'VE NEVER HEARD THEM BEING USED FOR
IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT
YOU'RE A TRUE VETERAN
FROM MEDICINES TO FOODS TO TEXTILES
TALLER THAN I AM
THE OPPORTUNITY AROSE WHEN
BECAUSE HERE IN THE HEART OF RURAL WILTSHIRE
THERE IS NO ONE TO HOLD MY ALL
TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO FIND EVIDENCE OF THE BOMB PLOT
HOW LONG AGO WAS THAT
THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED GALLONS OF WATER
WE TRAVELLED ALL OVER THE PLACE
BUT I DECIDED AGAINST IT
ANITA MANNING YOUR CHALLENGE IS TO GO OUT AND CONVERT THAT INTO SOMETHING LOVELY THAT'S GOING TO BE
WE'RE HEADING OFF TO BRUM
THEY MARRIED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE
IT'S A BIT CRUCIAL
BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T GO WELL
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
FROM EVERY WINDOW FLOWERS
THEY FALL AT MY FEET
YOU PULL A THE LEG
BUT IN ALL OUR INTERESTS
AND NOT TRUSTING DRAWERS OR SAUSAGES
YOU ARE TRYING TO COMMIT SUICIDE
THERE ARE PAINTINGS MISSING
I CANNOT GET MY FILL
AND HE RETIRED IN ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY ONE
OUR EXPERTS' VALUATIONS
AND ON THE ROSTRUM IS OUR VERY OWN ADAM PARTRIDGE
THIS IS MY TURN TO BE THE EXPERT
I KNOW YOU'RE SLIGHTLY NERVOUS
JUST LIKE THIS ONE
BELCHING OUT BLACK SMOKE EVERYWHERE
ALL OF A SUDDEN
PLENTY OF WATER TO POWER THESE NEW FACTORIES
IT WAS A TOUGH LIFE
ALMOST ALL OF THEM WERE MADE IN SWITZERLAND
YOU'VE GOT MARRIED
EVERYBODY HAS GONE HOME HAPPY
SO UNTIL THE NEXT TIME
THIS IS WHERE WE LET YOU INTO SOME OF OUR TRADE SECRET
VERY SERIOUS DAMAGE
AND AND I THOUGHT THE SALE PRICE WAS PRETTY STRONG
BEARING THAT IN MIND
I THINK IF IT WAS PERFECT
POUND BUT IT WAS FAR FROM PERFECT
AND THE RESTORATION COST ON THAT WOULD'VE BEEN IMMENSE
WHO WAS YOUR FAVOURITE
I DIDN'T LIKE DYLAN
IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IT WITH IT
IT REALLY DOES PUT COLLECTORS OFF
IT'S TIME FOR BED
IT'S THE WHOLE GAME OF THE MAGIC ROUNDABOUT
SOUNDS A LOT OF MONEY FOR SOMETHING WHICH IS RELATIVELY MODERN
I'VE GOT A LADY PENELOPE TOOTHBRUSH AT HOME THAT MY DENTIST GAVE ME
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WHY PUT A HUNDRED POUNDS ON IT
WHY NOT RESEARCH IT
WHY NOT FIND OUT
THE FACT THAT IT'S SIGNED
IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT THAT MAKES YOU BUY IT
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS LOOK AT THE OBJECT FIRST
YOU HAVE TAUGHT US THAT IT PAYS TO KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED AT ALL TIMES
IT SOLD PRETTY WELL
IT WAS A GOOD ESTIMATE BY JAMES
IT WAS A NICE CONSERVATIVE GUIDE PRICE TO SHOW THE BUYERS THAT IT'S ON THE MARKET
WE ALWAYS LIKE THAT
BRONZE IS NOT MAGNETIC
BUT CAST IRON IS
GET YOUR LITTLE MAGNET OUT
ALONG WITH YOUR EYEGLASS AND EVERYTHING ELSE
AND HAVE A FINAL CHECK WITH A MAGNET
PRETTY GIRL WITH THE TOP OFF
IT'S WORTH TEN TIMES MORE THAN AN OLD GRIZZLY OLD MAN
SAME SIZE SCULPTURE
DIFFERENT SUBJECT MATTER
THEY'D HAD A GO
BECAUSE THERE ARE WONDERFUL THINGS OUT THERE WAITING TO BE PICKED UP AT CAR BOOT SALES ALL OVER THE
THINK IT WASN'T OVERLY EXPENSIVE
THAT'S WHAT GUIDED LINDA TO BUYING THAT IN THE FIRST ONE
IT WAS A SPUR OF THE MOMENT THING
THAT THEY MADE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS
BUT LINDA'S VASE
IT WAS QUITE GROTESQUE
I CAN'T HELP BUT BE INSPIRED BY THOSE OF YOU WHO GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING IN PURSUIT OF CARBU
AND IS VERY PROUD OF ONE PARTICULAR FIND
WHICH ORIGINALLY WOULD'VE BEEN WHALEBONE
SO IT'S ACTUALLY MOVED ON TO PLASTIC STAYS THERE
IF YOU WISH TO ACCEPT IT
IS TO SEARCH THE CAR CELL IN ORDER TO FIND A BARGAIN PIECE OF POTTERY OR PORCELAIN
TO PUT IT TO THE TEST
WE ASKED TWO FLOG IT REGULARS TO GET UP WITH THE LARKS AND GO ON A MISSION
THE OLD THUNDERBALL WATCH
THAT'S VERY USABLE
THAT IS NICELY THROWN
SAME SORT OF TOOLS
HE'S A MAN WITH A PASSION FOR ANTIQUES AND COLLECTABLES
I SAW IT ON THE M ONE AND I FOLLOWED IT ALL THE WAY FROM LEEDS DOWN TO RUGBY AND
ANYTHING LIKE THAT
I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY MADE IN CANTON
THE MOTIFS WERE CHINESE
THERE WAS A DRAGON
UM LOOK FOR A FIGURE
LOOK FOR A GRAIN IN THE MATERIAL
IVORY HAS A VERY DISTINCT GRAIN
IF YOU BUY QUALITY
BECAUSE WHENEVER I GO TO A CAR BOOT SALE
THERE ARE PLENTY OF FLOGG IT STORIES OF ASTONISHING FINDS THAT WILL INSPIRE YOU TO DELVE A BIT
HE WASN'T EVEN AN EARLY BIRD
THEY'D BEEN THERE
THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE PIECES OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CARICATURE IN THERE
WHERE THERE'S A GOOD MARGIN AROUND THE THE THE PRINT IMAGE
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS THINK
WHO KNOWS MORE ABOUT THIS THAN ME
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW IT
BUT HALF THE TIME
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHERE I WENT
ONE OF THE GREAT CAR BOOT FINDS OF THE PROGRAMME THAT I'VE HAD THAT I'VE HAD INVOLVEMENT WITH
AND IT WAS SO OBVIOUS IT WASN'T A FAKE
THE AGE WAS WAS WRITTEN ALL OVER IT AND THE MARKS
TO TELL TELL
I REMEMBER THE LIP AND TOOTH MARKS ON IT
AND JUST EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
YOU JUST KNEW IT WAS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT GENUINE
THERE'S A COUPLE OF REASONS FOR THAT
MALCOLM HAD ONLY PAID THIRTY PENCE FOR IT
THEY WERE QUITE AN UNUSUAL PATTERN
THEY WERE PRETTY ENOUGH
SO GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND GET OUT THERE CAR BOOTING
IT MAY BE THE BEST THING YOU'VE EVER DONE
AS ARE ALL THE DESERT SPOONS
BECAUSE I'M CALLED DOG WE CLEAR THE ROAD
ROCKET AND MAC WANTED TO KNOW IF ANYONE HAD FIVE LITRES OF BLEACH
SOME GAME CALLED
GET MY OWN WORK
SHE DON'T KNOW YOU'RE MY SISTER
WELCOME TO WILMSLOW
THEY'VE DONE REALLY
THEY'VE DONE REALLY WELL
WORKING HARD ALREADY
AND THE TOWN IS BASED TEN MILES DUE SOUTH OF THE CITY OF MANCHESTER
POSSIBLY HALF A MILLION
IT'S ALSO ONLY THREE MILES FROM MANCHESTER AIRPORT
I THINK ST BERNARD DOGS ARE FAMOUS FOR GOING AND RESCUING PEOPLE IN THE WET AND WINDY WEATHER
BECAUSE I WANT TO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT A FLOG IT FAVOURITE
NAMED IN COMMEMORATION OF THE GREAT MAN
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING GOING FOR IT
WHY DID HE MOVE TO SALFORD
I DON'T BLAME YOU IN A WAY
REMEMBER THAT WONDERFUL PORTRAIT
LET'S SEE WHAT IT DOES
I'M POPPING IN TO NEARBY MANCHESTER TO CHECK OUT THE MOST GLORIOUS EDWARDIAN BUILDING
THEY DON'T BUILD THEM LIKE THEY USED TO
AND THEN THE FEMALES
SOME NEW BUILDS AS WELL
WASN'T IT FOR THE PUBLIC TO ENJOY IT EVERY DAY
AND AS THEY SAY WHERE I COME FROM
THERE'S NOTHING GREENER
IT'S GOING TO SELL
AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT NO RESERVE
WELL DONE THAT MAN ON THE ROSTRUM
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
BUT RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE I'M BACK IN CORNWALL
THAT'S BECAUSE I'M SURROUNDED BY TROIKA
WE DO SEE A LOT OF IT
IT'S GOING UNDER THE HAMMER
I CAME IN HERE TO BE VERY CROSS WITH YOU
IN SINGLE FILE AT THE DOUBLEUP TO THE TOP OF THE CHURCH TOWER
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF
SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT
AND TO DO A FULL PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO
IS THAT ALL MY FAULT
DID I DRIVE YOU TO DRINK AS WELL
I'VE GOT COMPANY
WE'RE' WE'RE FAIRLY MINIMALIST
SO WHAT'S IT WORTH
IF IT'S GENUINE AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
IT COULD BE WORTH AS MUCH AS
THEN MAYBE TWO TO THREE HUNDRED
AND THEY HAD A REPRODUCTION MADE
AN EXACT REPLICA
BUT FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME
AND I'LL BE CATCHING UP WITH SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE TURNED WHITE AND WOODS INTO A LIVING LABORATORY
AND AN ANIMAL HAS ITS NICHE
BUT THAT WASN'T DOWN TO ACADEMIA
WHICH FLOURISHED INTO AN OBSESSION OF OBSERVING ALL LIVING THINGS
I'M STILL TRYING
PUTTING PEN TO PAPER
HE WROTE ABOUT WHAT HE SAW
HOW COULD THE DAM
THAT'S THE MOTHER MOUSE
AND IN HIS LAST LETTER
IN THE MANUSCRIPT
HE WROTE TO A FRIEND
I SHALL HERE TAKE A RESPECTFUL LEAVE FROM YOU AND FROM NATURAL HISTORY
AND THAT SEEMS TO STIMULATE SOMETHING IN THE SOIL
BUT BEFORE WE START
BUT ACTUALLY THE PRINCIPLE IS FAIRLY EASY TO EXPLAIN
IMAGINE THIS WAS THE MOUNTAIN
IF YOU CAN WEIGH THAT ROCK AND YOU KNOW HOW HOW LARGE IT IS
MASKSCULINE SPENT A LONG TIME LOOKING FOR A SUITABLE MOUNTAIN
HE WAS ASSISTED BY CHARLES HUTTON
WHO SURVEYED THE MOUNTAIN
REALLY INVENTED THE WHOLE NOTION OF CONTOUR LINES
LET'S GO TO THE WEATHER STUDIO IN LONDON
AND A MINIMUM OF FOUR POUNDS FROM THE SALE OF EVERY CALENDAR WILL GO TO THE BBCS CHILDREN IN NEED APPEAL
NEXT WEEK WE'LL BE IN THE PEAK DISTRICT
I'LL BE DEEP UNDERGROUND WHERE NEW TREASURE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED AND ELLIE WILL BE GETTING ON HER
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT
AS THEY CAME TO BE KNOWN
I HAVE ONE THING FOR A WHILE AND
A MAN WHO WAS REGARDED BY SOME AS A SUPERHERO
HE TRAVELLED TO BELGIUM
HIS FIRST TRIP ABROAD
I PUT IT ON TO ESCAPE THE GERMANS
BUT I DID HEAR SOMEBODY MENTION THE SECOND SUNDAY IN EPIPHANY
I WAS BORN IN A SNOW STORM
THIS IS TERRIBLE
BUT I AM MAKING PROGRESS
PERHAPS I HAD BETTER GO HOME
PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT
I AM A DEAD DUCK
BEATING OUR EXPERTS TO ALL THE FINDS
AND I'VE JUST COME ACROSS THIS BOOK
TRYING TO COPY BOBBY CHART SCORING A GOAL
OR EVEN IN A NEW CAR
WE'RE LOOKING AT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TO ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY
IT'S BEEN REALLY INTERESTING
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF AUTOMOBILE MEMORABILIA
ALL YOU HEARD WAS
THIS IS A PROGRAMME OF TWO HALVES
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
BUT LOOKING AT THIS
THIS LOOKS TO BE
DOCTORS AND PHYSICIANS
GOING UNDER THE HAMMER RIGHT NOW
YOU'LL WANT TO GET ONE OF THESE
SELLING ON MY BOOKS HERE AT TWO THIRTY
IT'S NOT THE BEST QUALITY
COME AND JOIN US
IT'S GOODBYE FROM ALL OF US HERE IN CHESHIRE
WHAT A FABULOUS DAY WE HAVE HAD HERE
ALL CREDIT TO ADAM PARTRIDGE ON THE ROSTRUM
BECAUSE EVERYONE'S GONE HOME HAPPY
AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
WE'VE ALL LEARNT SOMETHING
WE'VE EXPERIENCED THE HIGHS AND LOWS
IT COULD BE YOUR TURN NEXT TIME
WHAT HAD BEEN A FULL HOUSE OF HONEST AND OBEDIENT MONKS WERE DEED
SO CERTAINLY COMPARED TO WHAT WAS AROUND BEFORE NYLON
IT WAS A BIG STEP FORWARD
SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST ROCKS AND SEAWEED
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
NOW LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY
I AM MOST DISPLEASED WITH YOUR LACK OF PROGRESS
THE UNDERLYING PATTERN WAS CLEAR
THIS IS A LETTER FROM A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC TO SIR DENIS FOLLOWS
WHY DON'T YOU BELT UP
YOUR POMPOUS FOOL
THE GOLDEN BOY OF BRITISH ATHLETICS
TO PULL OUT OF THE MOSCOW GAMES
MARGARET THATCHER SAW THE SOVIET INVASION AS A HISTORIC TURNING POINT
SHE WASN'T SURPRISED THOUGH BECAUSE AS SHE LATER PUT IT
SHE'D ALWAYS KNOWN THE NATURE OF THE BEAST
SHE NEEDED THE BEAST
INDEED IN MANY WAYS
IT WAS THE BEAST THAT MADE HER NAME
THE MILITARY SENSE
SHE TOLD HER AUDIENCE
THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE A SUPER POWER IN ONLY ONE SENSE
IN HER HYSTERICAL SPEECH
EARLY THE NEXT MORNING IN THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM
LENINISM ON THE ASH HEAP OF HISTORY
AS IT HAS LEFT OTHER TYRANNIES
DURING THE DARK DAYS OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR
WINSTON CHURCHILL'S SPEECH OF FULTON
MISSOURI IN NINETEEN FORTY SIX
HERE IN THE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER
HIS IMAGE OF THE ASH HEAP OF HISTORY WAS DISTURBINGLY APPROPRIATE
THERE'S ALSO LOTS OF FACTS AND FIGURES ABOUT THE COLD WAR AND THEY'D BEEN GIVEN TO THE BAND'S
WAR WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU READ ABOUT IN THE HISTORY BOOKS
I WAS PART OF A GENERATION WHO HAD NEVER FELT THE THUMP OF A BOMB DROPPING
NOW THINGS DON'T GO ENTIRELY SWIMMINGLY FOR POOR OLD DANNY
HIS MOTHER IS KILLED IN THE BLAST AND THEY HAVE TO WRAP HER IN POLYTHENE
HIS BROTHER BEN
AND AT THE END OF THE BOOK
DIES OF RADIATION SICKNESS
THIS BOOKLET WAS SUPPOSED TO REASSURE PEOPLE
AND THEY USED MAINLY LOCAL PEOPLE AS THE ACTORS
THE DIRECTOR TOLD THEM
COME AS BADLY LOOKING AS YOU DARE
THEY WERE THE ENEMY WITHIN AND THIS WAS MERELY ONE BATTLE IN HER WIDER WAR AGAINST COMMUNISM
THEY CALLED IN THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR AND TOLD HIM THAT IF THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE KREMLIN WAS
SO NOW THE FOREIGN OFFICE GOT INVOLVED
THIS WAS THE ONE THAT SHE WAS MOST PREPARED FOR
FOR A LONG DIALOGUE
THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE EVENING
APART FROM PHIL COLLINS SPEAKING GERMAN OBVIOUSLY
BOWIE SAID LATER THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST EMOTIONAL PERFORMANCES HE HAD EVER GIVEN
WHEN HE PERFORMED HEROES
THE WAY THAT ONE COUNTRY CAN INFLUENCE ANOTHER
FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS
EVER SINCE THE DAYS OF THE BEATLES
BRITISH POP AND ROCK HAD BEEN INFILTRATING THE SOVIET BLOC
WHAT DID WE DO WITH OUR VICTORY
NOW FREE FROM ALL RESTRAINT BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN
THIS WAS THE SYSTEM THAT HAD WON THE COLD WAR
FOR THE CATHOLIC PRIEST
A BECAUSE HE WAS NOT THE PROPER PRIEST
AND B BECAUSE EVEN THE GOOD LORD HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD ONE WORD OF
DUE TO HIS ATROCIOUS ACCENT
THE IDIOT ENGLISH AGENT
WORD OF MOUTH EXAGGERATES LITTLE THINGS INTO BIG THINGS
I CAN SEE HER NOW SCRAPING AT THE BARE EARTH WITH HER BARE HANDS
I AM GOING TO GIVE MYSELF UP TO THE GERMANS
THEY WILL PUT ME IN JAIL
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO VISIT ME
AND WITH GOOD CONDUCT
I WILL BE OUT IN A FEW YEARS
IT'S QUITE NORMAL IN WAR TIME
I WILL GIVE YOU ALL THE ASSISTANCE THAT I CAN
BE NEAR ENOUGH TO HEAR HIS DYING WORDS
TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF ANYBODY HE MEETS
I WANT IT UP HERE
MY LIFE IS IN DANGER
IT IS THE WOMEN OF THE CAFE THAT I SHOULD KILL
IT'S A LANCASTER BOMBER
A BRITISH HEAVY BOMBER
THEY DON'T FETCH A LOT OF MONEY
SO IT'S NOT TOO BAD
COULD WE PUT THIS IN AT TWO TO FOUR HUNDRED
I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
SHE'S GOT TWO GRANDCHILDREN BUT THEY NEVER KNEW HIM
AND THEY DON'T LIKE ME
UNTIL THE NEXT TIME
SEA BATHING STARTED HERE AROUND TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO
I HAVE A BULB TO SELL
AND NOBODY BOUGHT IT IN HARLEM
WE'RE TEN MILES FROM THE SEA
TO FIND OUT WHAT MAKES THIS LANDSCAPE IDEAL FOR REARING COWS
SHE WOULD HAVE MARRIED ME
THEY WERE OLD VEGETABLE SELLERS
WE FELL OUT OVER THE PRICE OF SPRING GREENS
WE CAN HAVE A PRIVATE FANCY DRESS PARTY
THE GENERALS WILL BE MEETING HERE AT MY CHATEAU TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION
THESE MOMENT MAY BE OUR LAST
YOUR ESTIMATE WILL BE THE LOWEST
I AM A MASS OF NERVES
BUT I AM WORRIED
RICH AND FASHIONABLE
LET'S HOPE THE RESIDENTS OF BATH TODAY BEHAVE THEMSELVES
SO IT REALLY IS AN HONOUR FOR US TO BE HERE TODAY
THIS MAGNIFICENT BUILDING HAS THREE MAIN ROOMS THE TEA ROOM
THE OCTAGON ROOM AND THE DANCE HALL
WHICH WE'LL BE FEATURING IN TODAY'S SHOW
PEOPLE HAVE TRAVELLED FROM FAR AND WIDE
OUR FIRST ITEM IS JUST ABOUT TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER
IT WOULDN'T REALLY BE VIABLE TO WEAR IT
WE HAVE NO BLACK ENAMEL
IF WE SELL THEM YOU'LL GET MAYBE BETWEEN FIVE AND EIGHT HUNDRED
THE ASSEMBLY ROOMS
THIS IS TOTALLY OUT OF MY LEAGUE
THEY SAY DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND
IF YOU'RE GOING OUT LOOKING FOR THINGS MORE ACCESSIBLE THINGS
THERE WERE NO TELEVISIONS
THERE WAS NO INTERNET
AT OUR FLOG IT VALUATION DAYS
WE SEE MANY OBJECTS THAT WERE ONCE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT
SO WHAT DO OUR EXPERTS THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR
INTO THE FIFTY S AND SIXTY S WHICH ARE PROBABLY MORE RELEVANT TODAY THAN THEY WERE THEN
THEY WERE REJECTED THEN AS BEING TOO RACY
THINGS THAT I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP WITH AS A CHILD TELEVISIONS
IF YOU'RE GOING OUT LOOKING FOR THINGS MORE ACCESSIBLE THINGS
IS PROBABLY OLD RADIOS
NOW I DON'T KNOW AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT THEM MYSELF
BUT THERE ARE A FEW RADIOS THAT CAN BE EXTREMELY RARE AND VALUABLE
SO MOSTLY THEY SEEM TO COST TEN OR TWENTY QUID
AH WE'RE ALL ON NUMBER FIVE S NOW
HOME MIGHT BECOME A DESIGN CLASSIC OF THE FUTURE
IF YOU ARE THINKING OF BUYING SOMETHING FOR THE HOME
CONSIDER MAYBE SOMETHING WITH A DESIGNER APPEAL
HE'S A RUGBY LOVING
SPORTS CAR DRIVING MAN'S MAN
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME BECAUSE I'M A WORCESTER BOY
I WAS EDUCATED IN WORCESTER
BUT IN TERMS OF WHETHER I'D ACTUALLY WANT TO OWN IT
WHAT WOULD IT BE
IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY
WHETHER IT WORKS AS A TELLY
I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
HANGING IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM THERE BY A CHAIN
NO RETRO COLLECTORS HERE TODAY
AND MY MOTHER HAS RECENTLY DIED
BUT I GOT A BIT OF AUCTION FEVER AND I WENT UP AND I WENT UP AND I WENT UP
I DROPPED OUT AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED
IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE BUYING FOR
IF YOU'RE BUYING TO MAKE A PROFIT ON SOMETHING
IF YOU REALLY LIKE IT
IF IT'S A BIT MORE THAN YOUR BUDGET
UNABLE TO MEET HIS MORTGAGE
PLEASE TRY THE ANTIQUE SHOPS OR THE AUCTION ROOMS
SMALL PIECES OF FURNITURE
AND THEREFORE EVERYTHING IS GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY
GO TO YOUR LOCAL SALEROOM
SEE SOMETHING YOU LIKE AND YOU WILL BE HUGELY SURPRISED ABOUT HOW AFFORDABLE IT IS
SO GO AND BUY SOME NICE PIECES OF FURNITURE
I FIND THAT EDWARD IN INLAID FURNITURE CELLS EXTREMELY STRONGLY
PRICE BUT I SUPPOSE THAT'S AUCTIONS
THANK GOODNESS WE HAD A BIT OF A RESERVE ON IT JUST TO PROTECT IT
WHICH IS TO HAVE SOMETHING IN YOUR HOME WHICH IS PRACTICAL BUT
AND NOT EVERYBODY LIKES OLD THINGS
THINGS EVEN THOUGH I THINK THEY'RE AMAZING
UM AND SO SOME PEOPLE GIVE UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY GOOD QUALITY RELATIVELY CHEAPLY
MAYBE HAVE SORT OF SHABBY CHIC OLD PINECHES DRAWERS IN A MODERN BEDROOM SETTING
CAN FIT IN ANY HOME
AND UNIQUE STYLE FOR ANY KIND OF INTERIOR
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOUR HOUSE IS MODERN
I COULD GRADE THIS IT'S BETTER THAN SOME
THERE'S SOMETHING ADDICTIVE ABOUT IT
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT THE DESIRE TO ADORN OUR HOMES
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR YOURS
ANITA MANNING HAS A SUGGESTION
AND WHEN ONE DOES COME INTO A VALUATION DAY WITH A FASCINATING HISTORY
I FIGHT THE EXPERTS FOR IT
MARK STACEY BEAT ME TO IT
YOU KNOW WHERE TO COME
SO LET'S GO BARGAIN
IT'S WHAT YOU WANT
I WANT TO LOOK AROUND AND THEN SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
THE AMAZING THING IS
YOU'RE PREDICTING A PROFIT
YOU ARE SO STRONG
IF THE LONG DISTANCE DUCK SEES OUR BU
HE WILL BE PUT OFF
BUT WHAT A FOR YOU WEAR HONOR YOUR HEAD
YOU WILL NOT SPEAK UNLESS YOU ARE SPOKEN TO
LET'S RAISE THE BAR
THAT WAS FOUR OUT OF FIVE
IT IS QUITE LATE
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I LIKE MY WOOD
THAT'S FOR SURE
YOU'VE GOT A BIG
WHEN YOU COME HOME AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY DAY
HAVING A STUPID
THERE'S A CORPORAL INSIDE YOU
A GOOD OFFICER SPOTS POTENTIAL IN HIS MEN
IF I TAKE A SHIT
ROCKET WANTS FOOD
WHY DO YOU THINK I DON'T LIKE SCRABBLE
LIKE JUST BEFORE THIS TOUR
ROCKE BLU WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND
I JUST THINK I'VE GOT ALL THE QUALITIES THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
HE BEHAVED LIKE A TOTAL ARSSHOLE TO ANYONE WHO WASN'T IN HIS LITTLE BUBBLE
YOU LIKE SCRABBLE
FAMILY AND ESPECIALLY HER CHURCH
THAT ENABLED SUSAN TO BOUNCE BACK
APART FROM THAT REMARKABLE VOICE
AND YOUR MOTHER
THERE'S ONE DAY I THINK THEY THEY SORT OF CHASED YOU HOME FROM FROM SCHOOL
WITH A PLASTIC KIND OF COVER THING
AND KIND OF ALL DRIPPING
OR SUMMONS UP AN EMOTION SHE SINGS
SO THAT VISIT TO LORDS WHEN YOU CAME HOME
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE IN THE WEST END
DOING CALENDAR GIRLS
I WAS IN THE ORIGINAL CAST OF THAT AND WE HAD WE WERE THE FIRST ONES TO GO IN THE WEST END
AND ON THE EVENING OF THE BRITAIN'S GOT TALENT NOW MEGA EVENT
YOU SHOULD SEE IT
AND I TURNED TO SHA PHILLIPS
IT WAS LIKE PRINCESS DIANA
AND IF SHE COULD SOMEHOW EQUATE
BECAUSE WHEN SHE IS OUT ON THE STAGE
MAYBE SIX MONTHS
LIKE KIDS WENT TO SCHOOL
WATCH THE TELLY
AFTER ALL THE CHAOS
ALL THE MADNESS
IT WAS TOTALLY NORMAL FOR SUSAN TO GET UP
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PACKAGING
AND IT'S NEVER HAPPENED
PROBABLY AT THE TIME
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT AND
AND SHE WAS IN HER ROOM
WITH WITH A STRONG FAITH
VERY SPECIAL THING
LISTENING TO CHRISTMAS MUSIC GIVES YOU THAT FEELING OF GOING TO THE CHURCH OVER CHRISTMAS
THE WHOLE THING
IT MEANS SO MUCH MORE
SUSAN REPRESENTS THAT
VERY DEEP AND PROFOUND LEVEL WITH PEOPLE
I'D LIKE PEOPLE TO
SHE BEARS NO MALICE TOWARDS HER TORMENTORS
AND IT MADE ME REALISE THAT IF I STAY HERE I CAN'T DO THAT
SO I'M GOING TO GO STAY WITH ZOE IN SPAIN
WILL YOU LOVE HER
SO YOU'RE MARRIED
WHY DON'T WE GO AND GET SOME OF HER STUFF
AND THEN YOU REMEMBERED
HOW ARE YOU WORKING OUT THAT MULTIPLIER
THE TRANSPORT AND DISTRIBUTION
FURTHER THINGS LIKE UNIVERSITY
THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH
IT'S ALSO AN RSPB RESERVE
ONE OF THE ADMISSIONS OFFICERS WAS REALLY IMPRESSED
WE PROMOTE A SPORTING BIRD
FISH FARMING'S BENEFITS ARE EASY TO SEE
EMPLOYMENT WHERE IT'S SCARCE AND A NUTRITIOUS SOURCE OF FOOD
MY DAD GAVE US A RARE BREED EACH TO GET US INTO RARE BREEDS CONSERVATION
AND HE GAVE ME THE EXMOOR PONIES HERE
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN UP FOR THE GATHER BEFORE
THEY DON'T MIND THE TERRAIN
WHILE HE WAS DOING THAT
AND WITH THIS VEIN OF BLUE JOHN
IT'S HE'S DONE IT IN ONE SWIFT GIRL
SEVENTY YEARS OF LOOKING AND FINDING NOTHING AND THERE IT IS
LEADING THROUGH TO SHEFFIELD
AMONG OTHER THINGS
VERY HARD TO GET HOLD OF
VERY SHORT SUPPLY
THE MAN IN CHARGE
CAN WE CAN WE HAVE A LOOK AT THAT
WE'RE HERE TO CHASE COMETS AND IN PARTICULAR COMET ISON
AS FAR AS WE KNOW
OUT THERE IN THE DEPTH OF SPACE
AS IT APPROACHES THE SUN
THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL DARK BLUE SKY ABOVE US AND WE'VE BEEN GIVEN THE RUN OF NOT ONE BUT TWO
DURING THE NIGHT
THERE'S NOBODY LOOKING AFTER IT
TONIGHT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN USE OF A SCIENTIFIC SECRET WEAPON
IT'S ALL AUTOMATED
THAT'S BEEN OUT THERE
SO WE'RE FILMING ON THE INFRARED CAMERA
I THINK OF THE CLASSIC COMMENT
WHICH IS JUST AS WELL
IT'S DARK OUTSIDE
WHICH MEANS TURNING IT OFF AND ON AGAIN
AND IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL TRIP
WE'LL BE TAKING A BREAK
AS WE HEAD INTO THE NEW YEAR
EVERY PATIENT USED TO HAVE A MENU
THEY'VE THEY'VE NEVER WRITTEN A RECIPE
I CAN TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO CHANGE THAT IN A WEEK
SO WE'RE TWO MONTHS INTO THE FINANCIAL YEAR
I WANT TO TRY AND BUILD THEIR PASSION BACK
THE PASSION THEY HAD FROM DAY ONE AFTER THE FIRE
STUFF EVERYBODY ELSE
I WOULDN'T EXPECT THAT TO MAKE MUCH MORE THAN TEN
IT'S A GREAT THING YOU
I ACTUALLY RUN A WEDDING SHOP NOW
WE'RE HEADING TO HAVE A LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT MUY
SHE DID SO WELL MAKING THESE CRISPS THAT SHE MOVED TO A FACTORY THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND HEY
COULD BE YOURS TODAY FOR THIRTY
CANE HANDLE TO THE TEAPOT
SO HE'S A PRETTY CUNNING OPERATOR
SO THINK IT MIGHT NEED SOME ATTENTION TO PLUG IT INTO YOUR MODERN DAY SYSTEM
SO THAT SHOULD TURN A PROFIT
WE'LL FIND OUT ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT AND
AND VERY GOOD LUCK ON THE ROSTRUM
AND THAT'S COVENTRY
BUT THEY'RE STILL WONDERFUL QUALITY
WE HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU
I'M VERY KEEN ON COVENTRY
AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EMOTION
BECAUSE IT LOOKS ARCHITECTURALLY REALLY
THANK YOU SO MUCH
ENJOY THE MONEY
I THINK YOU WILL
I'M HAPPY WHERE IM
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT IT
BY THE END OF THE DAY
PROBABLY MORE NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS THAN WE NEED TO USE
I WOULD SAY THAT AGAIN IT'S PROBABLY A COMMON PROBLEM ACROSS THE ENERGY
UM BUYING BETTER QUALITY INGREDIENTS
JUST ONE OR TWO CLEVER THINGS OR SEE ONE OR TWO THINGS THAT COULD BE CHANGED AND MAKE A BIG
ASK IT'S NOT COMPLICATED
BUT HOW HE DID IT IN FOUR MINUTES AND HE GOT TWO
THREE SOUPS ON THE GO
WELL FROM THE HEROES OF THE SKIES
HAVE YOU FOUND OUT ANYTHING MORE
I'M HAPPY ENOUGH WITH FIVE TO EAT AT THIS POINT
THERE IS COMMISSION TO PAY ON THAT BUT
WORTH WAITING FOR
SEE YOU AGAIN NEXT TIME FOR MANY MORE SURPRISES
LET'S HOPE OUR EXPERTS TODAY FIND SOME TREASURES TO RIVAL THE COLLECTIONS HERE AT WESTERN PARK
WE THINK THEY CAME FROM GERMANY
THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
PUTTING THOSE VALUATIONS TO THE TEST
WILLLL BE GETTING ON THE ROSTRUM AND SELLING ALL OUR LOTS
WHAT ARE YOU GROWING
CATALOGUES AND REGISTRATION CARDS IN HAND
NOW OUR ITEMS HAVE COME FROM ALL OVER THE MIDLANDS BUT
BUT THEY'VE BEEN VIEWED BY PEOPLE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD
THAT'S WHAT MAKES AUCTIONS SO EXCITING TODAY
IT WAS JUST THE APPEARANCE AS I WALKED PAST
AND I KNOW YOU ARE AS WELL
I'M REALLY PLEASED TO MEET YOU
THEN YOU CAN GATHER THE BULBS
I'M NOT SAYING THEY WERE EXPERTS BUT
FOR THE NEXT STAGE
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ONCE WE'VE FINISHED WORKING WITH JAMES TEMPORARILY AND THEN AND MOVING ON
BUT WE'RE TRYING IT OUT ON ONE OF THE WARDS TO REDUCE THAT WASTE
BUT ALSO I'VE GIVEN THEM TWO NEW DISHES TO TRY FOR THE NEW MENU
IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU SEE BUT
PUTTING THE MESSAGE THROUGH THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO
WHEN I STARTED THIS PROJECT
WE'VE GOT DIFFERENT SATELLITE HOSPITALS RIGHT AROUND THE COUNTRY AND I'VE MANAGED TO PULL SUPPORT
WHICH WAS INTERESTING
BUT IT WAS ALSO FRUSTRATING
WE HAVE GREAT FOOD
STILL BUZZING FROM ITS RICHLY DESERVED SUCCESS AS THE FORMER EUROPEAN CAPITAL OF CULTURE
WHO LOOKING AFTER THE EQUIPMENT
SO NO RESERVE MEANS THEY MIGHT JUST MAKE TEN POUNDS
LET'S PUT THOSE VALUES TO THE TEST
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS EXCITING
IT'S NOW AUCTION TIME
WE'VE COME TO DOTS
IN THE HEART OF MOLD
TO PUT OUR VALUATIONS TO THE TEST
SO FINGERS CROSSED
MANY MORE SURPRISES
I'M GOING BACK TO THAT VERY IMPRESSIVE BUILDING IN LIVERPOOL'S ST GEORGE'S HALL
AND IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT QUIETER BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE VALUATION DAY
I'VE GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU
IT'S NOT BUT LOVELY GLOBE SHADE
WHO WAS THE FIRST CITY ORGANIST
IF THERE WERE THAT WERE A COMPLETE STOP
THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE STAMPED WITH THE NOTE ON THEM
YOU COULD GET TO
WE'VE COME TO THE END OF OUR SHOW TODAY
ALL CREDIT TO OUR EXPERTS
WE'RE COMING TO A TOWN NEAR YOU SOON SO LOOK OUT FOR DETAILS IN YOUR LOCAL PRESS BUT FOR NOW
IF YOU COULD MAINTAIN AN ADVANTAGE
HOW ATTRACTIVE THAT PROSPECT WAS FOR A NATO ALLIANCE THAT PERCEIVED THAT IT COULD NEVER
WE HAD NO MISSILE
WE HAD NO WARHEAD
WE HAD NO GUIDANCE SYSTEM
AND SO THIS WAS WHERE THE MONEY WAS
THIS IS WHAT THE FUTURE WAS
WE DIDN'T GET ENOUGH
IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT
AND WHAT'S MORE
GENTLY AND WITHOUT INCIDENT
AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S PART OF THE MENU SO
BIRMINGHAM WE'VE GOT A NEW MENU
IT'S MADE US SORT OF THINK OUT OF THE BOX BUT
YOU'RE LOSING ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY QUID
IT'S BEEN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC
SPEAKING TO THE PATIENTS ACTUALLY
BECAUSE YOU IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME TO GET WHERE WE ARE
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED
TO TAKE THE ISSUE OF FOOD SERIOUSLY
WHEN I STARTED THIS
I DIDN'T REALISE HOW BIG A PROJECT IT WOULD BE AND AND AND HOW BIG A PROJECT IT WOULD TURN INTO
PROBABLY NOT WORTH IT
BECAUSE I'M NOT GETTING ANYWHERE
WE'VE GOT THIS FAR AND
YOU WENT BACK AND SAW A MASSIVE CHANGE
JUST SEEING THEIR FACES TODAY
AND YOU HAVE BOUGHT WHAT YOU LOVE
WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW
I THINK BANG ON
I THINK IT'S VERY PLAIN
THAT WOULD BE THIRTY ONE
AND WE'VE PUT A GUIDE PRICE ON OF BETWEEN THIRTY AND FIFTY
BUT RIGHT NOW FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
BRETBY'S JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM HERE
POUND AND I FEEL IT WILL MAKE MORE
TWENTY POUNDS WAS PAID BY JANE
AND I THINK SHE PAID THE RIGHT PRICE
NOT A BIG PROFIT THERE
IT'S GOT AN INSCRIPTION ON IT
HOW ENTHUSIASTIC ARE YOU FEELING IN THIS VERY HOT WEATHER
WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH
THE TOUGH GETS GOING FOR HANSON
TO CREATE DRAMA
WE'VE NOT SHIFTED FAR
WE'VE STAYED IN DERBYSHIRE
THEY LIKE SMALL DOGS
BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY
WELCOME TO FLOG IT
WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING JUST AS HARD
BECAUSE OUR EXPERTS DO HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT
HE CAME BACK AND HE SAID
WITH REGARDS TO VALUE
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO GO
IS A LOT OF MONEY
PICKED UP FOR TEN PENCE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
THE KIND OF STORIES WE LIKE TO SEE
THE AUCTION'S STILL GOING ON IN THERE BUT THAT'S THE END OF OUR FIRST THREE LOTS
THE KNIFE AND THE FORK
WHEN WERE YOU THERE
IT'S BEEN A LONG WAIT
IT'S CAUSED QUITE A STIR
LOVELY SURPRISE FOR LYN THOUGH
EACH OF WHOM HAS ALREADY UNDERGONE A PRETTY RIGOROUS PROCESS TO GET THIS FAR
AH BUT NOW IT GETS REALLY DIFFICULT
THANKS FOR WATCHING
WE'VE GOT ALL YOUR FAVOURITES HERE
THE NATION'S TOP TV CHEFS ALL IN ONE PLACE ON THE A EDGE OF TV COOKING
THIS IS THE MARVELLOUS MARY BERRY AND SHE'S COME UP TRUMPS COOKING HER BEAUTIFUL SALMON WITH A
IT WILL NOT SEPARATE
BUT ALSO WE'VE GOT A LORD OF SPACE
THAT'S WHAT IT'S MEANT TO BE
THAT'S A BIG FISH
A VOLIVEVO
A GORGEOUS DISH FROM RAYMOND BLANC
HE'S GOING TO WHIP UP A CLASSIC SOUFFLE
ONE OF THOSE DISHES THAT MANY OF US FIND QUITE TRICKY
RAYMOND SAYS IT'S RELATIVELY SIMPLE AND HE'S GOING TO START THIS RECIPE BY CHOOSING THE PERFECT
THAT'S ALL THE COOKING WE'VE GOT TIME FOR TODAY
A BIG THANK YOU TO ALL OUR WONDERFUL CHEFS AND PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU JOIN ME AGAIN FOR MORE MAGICAL COOKERY
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT IT
BY THE END OF THE DAY
SO YOU LOVED ME
WE NO WE HAVEN'T DECIDED
THIS IS HIS WHOLE WORLD
BECAME VIOLENT AND SHE
MAYBE TWO YEARS
THIS IS YOUR HERITAGE
I THOUGHT YOU CAME UP HERE TO APOLOGIZE
THE WARSHIP HE'D BEEN TRAVELLING ON HAD SUNK IN HOME WATERS
SAID ONE OF KITCHENER'S NEW ARMY
HE LOSES THE OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THE ARMY
HE'S GOT NO CONTROL OVER THE BATTLEFIELD
BUT FROM FIVE HUNDRED HOURS OF PROGRAMMES
THEY SAID WHY DON'T WE TAKE THAT PICTURE
HAVE A WONDERFUL REACTION BUT HE WAS VERY TAME
WHO FARMED IN THE BORDERS
SAY WILD THINGS OR WHATEVER
THE NUMBER OF HORSES IN BRITAIN DROPPED DRAMATICALLY WELL BECAUSE OF THE USE OF CARS AND TRACTORS
I LOVE THE SETUP
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A MOBILE BLACKSMITH SHOP
AND YOU'RE HOT SHOEING ON SITE
FROM MAKING THE TOOLS TO ACTUALLY SHOING
GORGEOUS IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS
CAN'T FIND A MAKER'S MARK ON IT
YEAH AND HE WAS GOING TO BE USING IT
BECAUSE OF THE HISTORY
MY FAMILY GREW UP IN THIS NORTH END AREA
LIKE ALL FAMILIES
IT WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE WAR
WILL TAKE SOMEONE AND MYSELF OVER FIRST
WHEN THE SAILORS CAME INTO PORT THEY USED TO TAKE THEIR WIVESBOARD
AND THERE'S A BAN ON FRANK SINATRA OKAY
CAN YOU REPEAT THE TWELVE LEAD
PARAMEDICS HAVE THEIR OWN WAY OF DOING THINGS
ESPECIALLY NOT BBC BOSSES
AND HOW A FRONT ROW SEAT AT SOME OF THE BIGGEST GLOBAL EVENTS OVER THE PAST HALF A CENTURY HAS
JOURNALIST OF THE YEAR TWICE
AND FOR HIS COVERAGE OF THE FIRST GULF WAR
WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM
I ENVY THAT SO MUCH
I WISH I HAD THAT QUALITY
ROY HAS ARRIVED
EVERY EVERY SUNDAY WE WOULD GO TO CHURCH AND THEY'D READ FROM THE CHRISTIAN
I THINK I NEVER
BINGO AND THEN YOU HAVE A CAR CRASH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
DO DO YOU WANT TO STAY OR DO YOU WANT TO GO
HE DID ADORE ME
THROUGH ALL THE SORT OF IRRITATION COME ON
WHERE BOTH OF THEM HAD THEIR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
AND I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT
IT WAS FIVE HOURS' DRIVE FROM LONDON
YOU ARE TAKING THE REVERSE OF OF THEIR VIEWS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY EXPRESS IT
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
DON'T YOU CALL A DOCTOR
AND WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT AND
YOU FEEL PAIN EASILY
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY
THE THING IS ABOUT ABOUT BEING A CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST
ABOUT BEING THE SON OF OF
AND THE BUSINESS OF NOT SMOKING
NOT GOING TO DOCTORS
I LOVE YOUR ACCENT
AND SO THIS WAS WHEN THE BEATLES WERE REALLY BIG AS WELL
PEOPLE LIKE JOHN AND PEOPLE LIKE ME
THE FALSE IMPRESSION
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STUFF IN THE PAPERS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF YOU CALLING AN ELECTION
GRABBED THE MICROPHONE
TRIED TO BREAK IT OUT OF MY HAND
BREATHLESS OF COURSE STILL
HE'S ON THE TRAIN
PEOPLE ARE SAYING TO ME
THIRTY WHEN HE GOT TO A PHONE
I WENT BACK AND WAITED VERY
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY JUST KIND OF AN ELABORATE WAY OF COMMITTING SUICIDE
AND I WOULDN'T DO THAT
BUT I ALWAYS FEEL AND SO FAR
THAT YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH MUCH MORE
AND SO WE WERE TOLD TO GET OUT
COOL AS COULD BE
I SUPPOSE BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE IT
AT CARRYING IDENTIFICATION
RATHER NICE LOOKING GIRL OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE
I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID
IVE JUST GOT THIS UTTER
IVE GOT THIS TREMENDOUS FAITH IN MY ABILITY TO TALK MY WAY OUT OF THINGS
AND I DIDN'T THEN
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO BE MURDERED
MR SIMPSON COMES FROM THE BBC
WE ALL KNOW THAT
AND THEY KNEW HIM
ESPECIALLY NOT BBC BOSSES
WHO WILL STOP IT
WHEN EVERYONE IS GOING ONE WAY
I WANT TO GET THIS DONE
I WANT TO TELL THE STORY IN THE WAY I WANT TO TELL THE STORY
I THINK IT'S IT'S HARD FOR ANYBODY
EVEN WITH SKYPE AND ALL THESE KIND OF THINGS I STILL
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE AMERICAN BOMBERS TO COME
DO YOU FEEL THAT EVIL IN THE ROOM
ASSUMING THAT IS THAT ITS AGREED IN THE FIRST PLACE
IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN TO SUCCEED
THINK THAT IS IT
I WANT TO RUN AND RUN
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER BANG
I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR SHOUTS OF INCOMING
MATTERS UNLESS IT'S BASED ON GOOD
BUT YOU CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT UNLESS YOU HAVE FOUND OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING
THAT CAN OFTEN BE A VERY DANGEROUS BUSINESS
OF TUTU AND THE OTHERS
WHICH WAS HAVING
I' FAILED TO SECURE PEACE
HALFWAY THERE IN THE PLANE
ORDERED THE PILOT TO TURN THE PLANE AROUND
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW AWKWARD THAT WOULD BE
IT'S WORTH SUPPORTING
I ALWAYS FEEL IS A BIT LIKE
BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE
AS SO OFTEN IN IN THE PAST
HE WAS HE WAS FIRST WITH THE STORY
AGAIN IN SOUTH AFRICA
APART FROM ANYTHING ELSE
THE MOMENT YOU'VE BEEN BLOWN OFF YOUR FEET
MAYBE JUST COLD
THAT'S BEEN THE TRAINING
WITH THE TRAINING OF THIRTY ODD YEARS
THE THE PRODUCER AND I WENT ROUND AND HE STILL HAD THE
THEIR LIFE BLOOD LITERALLY EBB FROM THEM
THEN YOU KNOW THAT IS WORTHLESS
IT'S IT'S WORSE THAN WORTHLESS
AND THE PURPOSE IS TO TELL PEOPLE BACK HOME WHAT'S HAPPENED
HE WAS JUST PART OF THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE
AND HE WAS A SWEET BOY
HE WOULD STOP TRAVELLING A LITTLE BIT
I CAN'T IMAGINE SEEING HIM SORT OF SAYING
HIS FAVOURITE PLACE ON THE PLANET
YOU WANT THAT IN A PARENT
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO
HAVE YOU OPENED ALL YOUR PRESENCE
I WANT TO BE THERE
YOU COULD IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE A CASE OUT FOR IT
NOT MY TRANSLATOR
JOHN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BIT SOPPY
THERE IS THERE IS THAT BIT OF
HE TRIES TO PRESENT THIS IMAGE OF THE HARD
THAT'S THAT'S HIS BUSINESS BUT
BUT HE MUST REJECT IT FROM THE BASIS OF KNOWING ABOUT IT
NOT OF IGNORANCE
AND SO MANY PEOPLE NOW
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
I THINK IT'S PSALM ONE THREE NINE
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN
HE LOOKS TO A WORLD WHERE HE WANTS PEACE AND HE HOPES FOR PEACE
AND IF HE CAN DO THAT
PERHAPS WE CAN TOO
BUT PERHAPS IF YOU'RE A SERIOUS WINNER TODAY ON BARGAIN HUNT
YOU HAVE MADE TWENTY FIVE POUNDS
WHICH WAS WATERED DOWN STUFF FOR EVERYDAY DRINKING
PROBABLY BETTER FOR YOU THAN THE WATER
YOU WOULD DRINK OUT OF A GLASS LIKE THIS
WHO WOULD BE ANNOUNCING EACH OF THOSE TOASTS
WE WANT SOMETHING THATS MAYBE A BIT MODERN
THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION
SO LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT
BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTH A CALL
DONE INCREDIBLY WELL
LET'S FIND OUT WHETHER THE AUCTIONEER THINKS THE BAROMETER IS SET FAIR OR NOT
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
FAMILY RUN CARE HOME
WE PICKED UP EVERYTHING
AND THEN THE BARE BONES THEMSELVES PAINTED AS IF THIS IS JOHN WESLEY
NOW THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
NOW FOR THE BLUES
AS WE BOTH KNOW
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
OVER AT THE AUCTION
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE DUCK
BECAUSE HE WADDLED ABOUT SO MUCH
THE RESISTANCE ARE AT THIS MOMENT DEVELOPING THE NEGATIVE
THEY ARE FANATICS THEY ARE BRAVE OF FIGHTING MEN
MY MEN WILL DO THIS
I DO NOT BELIEVE HIM TO BE THE GUILTY ONE
HAD I BEEN IN CHARGE OF SECURITY
WE ALREADY HAVE A SUSPECT REALLY
V HE IS GUILTY OR NOT
WELL EVERYONE IS NOW SAFELY SEATED INSIDE
DID MARK EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT THE CHINESE ARTEFACTS RIGHT NOW
TEN POUNDS OVER THE RESERVE
THAT'S THE END OF OUR FIRST VISIT TO THE AUCTION ROOM TODAY
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THAT LITTLE BIT OF TENSION
IT WAS THOUGHT THAT IT WASN'T THAT VALUABLE
GOING UNDER THE HAMMER RIGHT NOW
HE SPLIT THEM INTO LOTS OF DIFFERENT LOTS YOU KNOW
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN ME DISGUISED AS A FRENCH GENERAL
I BLEW UP A FLICK
HAS BEEN ARRESTED
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOWN SQUARE
THE ROTTEN APPLE IN OUR MIDST
SHOULD WE NOT PERHAPS DELAY THE TOAST UNTIL WE KNOW THE DATE
WHY HAVE YOU BEEN IGNORING ME
UNDER THE COVER OF AN AIR RAID
UNTOUCHABLE HEAD OF THE RESISTANCE
AND IN A MOMENT OF CARELESS ABANDON
I AM NOT WORTH IT
BUT IF IT IS GOING TO BE A SUICIDE PACT
SEE IT IS THE ANNIVERSARY OF OUR FIRST MEETING
IT'S NOT JUST THEIR FANTASTIC KNOWLEDGE
IT IS THE OBJECT
AND IT IS THE VALUE BUT
BUT IT'S THAT DRAMATIC CLIMAX TO THE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN THE EXPERT AND THE SUBJECT
THOUGH THAT'S IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH
I LOVE SEEING THEM PIECE TOGETHER A GRIPPING STORY
AND IT'S WHEN THEY TAKE AN UNSUSPECTING OWNER ON A JOURNEY OF REVELATION
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO CHOOSE THAT ONE
WILL BE CONFUSED
I ACTUALLY SAID TO HIM WELL YOU KNOW
THESE ARE INTERESTING
ONE WAS BY RENNIE MACKINTOSH
THE OTHER WAS NOT
WAS THE ONE THAT ERIC CHOSE
EVERYBODY'S COPYING IT NOW FROM ME
WE'VE ASKED OUR EXPERTS TO REVEAL THEIR TOP TIPS FOR CANNY BUYS IN THE CREDIT CRUNCH
BUT MONETARY VALUE IS JUST ONE WAY OF ASSESSING THE VALUE OF AN OBJECT
IN RECENT YEARS
THANKS TO THIS FAMILY HEIRLOOM
WELL WHAT WOULD YOU PUT YOUR MONEY INTO
WHILST I DO LIKE THE GREATER MAJORITY OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ASK
ME IF I HAD THAT ANSWER I WOULDN'T PROBABLY BE STOOD IN FRONT OF THEM TALKING
OVER OPEN GROUND
WAS RAPIDLY OVERSHADOWED BY THE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THIS REALLY ABOUT
WAS THAT WAS MY UNCLE
HERE IS AN UNIMPORTANT OBJECT TAKING ME AWAY INTO A GREAT HISTORY
I SOMETIMES THINK
TELL AT THE END OF A LONG DAY'S FILMING AT THE ROADSHOW
CAN YOU LOOK AT THIS STUFF
I'VE GOT SALVAGE BITS FOR WHATEVER COMES IN
AH TO ME AND SHE'S WITH THIS YOUNG MAN
SHE WAS GREAT ON CAMERA
SHE WAS RELAXED
I THINK THAT THAT WAS A MICROCOSM OF WHAT MAKES THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW
WHOSE HUSBAND TURNED OUT TO BE A PLUMBER
WHO IS WORKING AS A PLUMBER
HE'S FIXING SOMEONE'S COLD WATER TANK OR A SEPTIC TANK
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I HAD THIS IMAGE OF PUTTING HIS HAND DOWN IN THE TANK
ONE MORE SECRET ABOUT LIFE ON THE ROADSHOW
BUT EVERY NOW AND AGAIN
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
AND I GUESS I FEEL SLIGHTLY TERRITORIAL ABOUT ROCK AND ROLL MEMORABILIA WHEN IT COMES INTO THE ROADSHOW
CONSTANTINE THE GREAT
BUT WHATEVER YOU CALL IT
ONE OF THE MOST SEDUCTIVE BUT TERRIFYING CHARACTERS OF GREEK MYTHOLOGY
AND WORSE THAN THAT
EVERYBODY IN BYZANTIUM WAS RUSHING TO THE HIPPODROME
THE ENTERTAINMENT CENTRE OF THE CITY
HE HAD A VISION OF A CHRISTIAN SIGN IN THE SKY AND THE WORDS
I DON'T THINK CONSTANTINE WAS CLAIMING TO BE A THIRTEENTH APOSTLE
I THINK HE WAS CLAIMING TO BE JESUS CHRIST
MANY OF WHOM THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE CLOSE TO BEING DIVINITIES
WHATEVER THE IDIOSYNCRASIES OF CONSTANTINE'S PERSONAL BELIEFS
HE'D CREATED THE CHRISTIAN CITY OF CONSTANTINOPLE
BY CHOOSING TO BE BURIED HERE
WHILE WALKING THROUGH THE STREETS IN THE CENTRE OF CONSTANTINOPLE
WHICH IT REJECTED OUTRIGHT
IT WASN'T POPULAR
ROME HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY JESUS'S OWN DISCIPLES
RELIGIOUS BUILDINGS HAVE ALWAYS PROJECTED THE GLORY OF THE KINGS WHO BUILT THEM
JUSTINIAN AND THEODORA FOLLOWED SUIT
BUT THEY DID SO MORE MAGNIFICENTLY THAN ANYONE ELSE
AND THEY HAD GOOD REASONS TO PARADE THEIR PIETY
WHOSE SAVAGE RIVALRY DIVIDED THE CITY
AND OFTEN BROKE OUT INTO OPEN GANG WARFARE
SHE SAID IT WAS BETTER TO DIE IN IMPERIAL PURPLE THAN IT WAS TO LIVE WITHOUT IT
THEY SUMMONED THEIR FAVOURITE GENERAL
BUT THAT WAS THE POINT
SIZE MATTERED TO JUSTINIAN AND WHEN HE COMMISSIONED HIS ARCHITECT
HE REIGNED FOR ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF HE DIED WITH HER
THE PERSIANS INVADED
JUSTINIAN'S REIGN WAS JUDGED RATHER HARSHLY BY CONTEMPORARIES
AND HE SHOULD BE JUDGED IN HOW
AND IT BASED ITS SACRED LEGITIMACY ON THAT
IT MUST HAVE SEEMED LIKE EVERY NIGHTMARE HAD COME TRUE
IT MUST HAVE SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE WORLD HAD COME TO DESTROY
BEFORE THEM HERE
THEY FACED THE AVARS
THEIR BEST GENERAL
LEADING THE DEFENCE OF THE CITY
BUT IT WASN'T JUST ANY WOMAN
IT WAS THE VIRGIN MARY HERSELF AND SHE'D COME TO SAVE
BACKSTAGE AT THE CHARIOT RACING UNDER THE HIPPODROME
BUT THIS PLACE ALSO HAD A ESPECIALLY DARK AND GRUESOME ROLE IN BYZANTINE LIFE
BY SIX THREE EIGHT THEY'D TAKEN JERUSALEM AND MOST OF THE EASTERN ROMAN EMPIRE
BIZARRE AS IT MAY SEEM
IF THEY WERE STATUES THEY WERE SMASHED
MONASTERIES WERE RAIDED AND CHURCHES WHO REFUSED TO HAND OVER THEIR IMAGES WERE ATTACKED BY THE
THE THEOLOGICAL POSITION HAD CHANGED
EVER SINCE CONSTANTINE HAD MADE IT HIS NEW ROME
BUT WE NEEDED SOMEONE TO PLAY THE KEYBOARD
AND I WAS IN A PLASTER CAST
THEY ARE THE DIRECT DESCENDANTS OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE THIRTEEN
AROUND THE WORLD AND
WHICH MAKES ME NERVOUS
THAT IS QUITE A MOUTHFUL
SO THAT'S ALL QUITE PROMISING
BECAUSE WE DON'T SEE MANY OF THEM OVER HERE
YOU ARE MINUS TEN
MINUS TWELVE COULD BE A WINNING SCORE
YOU'RE NOW MINUS TWELVE
ALL AFTER A VALUATION AND ALL EAGER TO GET INSIDE
OUR EXPERTS DO HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT
IT WAS CUTTING EDGE FOR ARCHITECTURE AS WELL
I COME FROM A LONG LINE OF RAILWAY MEN GOING BACK TO GREAT GRANDFATHER
POETRY OR NOVELS
THEY EVEN REOPENED THE VILLAGE STORES FROM THEIR VERY OWN HOUSE
FROM THIS WINDOW
SERVING THE SCHOOLKIDS HALF PENNY SWEETS AND LETTING THEM USE THE PHONE BOX WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE NOVEL CHARTS THE UPRISING OF A GROUP OF ANIMALS AGAINST THEIR BELLIGERENT OWNER
AH GEORGE ORWELL'S REAL NAME
EILEEN WOULD HELP HIM DEVELOP HIS IDEAS AND IN FACT IT WAS HER SUGGESTION THAT HE GAVE ALL THE ANIMALS IN
THIS IS WHERE THE CHARACTERS SUCH AS OLD MAJOR
DESPITE ALL OF THESE PRESSURES
THE COUPLE MANAGED TO SPEND A FEW PRECIOUS MOMENTS TOGETHER
STAYING IN WALLINGTON WITHOUT THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE EILEEN PROVED A LITTLE TOO PAINFUL FOR HIM
THEY PASSED AWAY QUITE A WHILE AGO
EVEN ON A LOW CEILING
I JUST PICKED IT UP
WE'VE HAD A FUN PACKCK DAY AND IT'LL BE SAD TO LEAVE BUT
BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO PUT THOSE VALUATIONS TO THE TEST
HERE'S A QUICK RECAP
WE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED OURSELVES
IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES
I THINK LIGHTING THESE MIGHT BE TOO RISKY
YOU MUST SACRIFICE YOURSELF FOR FRANCE
EACH TIME I LOOK IN YOUR EYES
I AM TAKING THIS CHILD TO THE ORPHANAGE
GOOD LUCK WITH THE WAR
IMAGINE HOW SPECIAL A PIECE MUST BE IF THEY CAN STILL PICTURE THEM WITH AFFECTION
SO WE WERE IN THE RIGHT KIND OF AREA
AND NOT DOING VERY WELL
DAVID BATTIE FROM THE CERAMICS TEAM AND JOHN BLY FROM THE FURNITURE DESK NOW PICK OUT THE BEST OF
AND THEN MORE JOY
ENOUGH TIMES TO MAKE IT
HOPELESSLY BESOTTED BY OBJECTS
AND ONE MAN WHO KNOWS QUALITY WHEN HE SEES IT IS THE ROADSHOW'S ART DECO MAN
HE'S BEEN ON THE SHOW FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS
BUT THERE WAS ONE DAY WHEN HE STRUGGLED THE VERY FIRST TIME HE STEPPED IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA
THEY'RE BY BUGATTI
DO KNOW A FEW THINGS ABOUT
SHOW IT THE L
AND IT DAWNED ON ME WHAT HAD HAPPENED
AND INEVITABLY THEY WILL RETURN TO GLASS CABINETS AND MANTELPIECES
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING
AND THEN YOU HAD TO BE ABLE TO DO KNITTING
BUT TASTE CAN BE A FUNNY THING
THANK GOD YOU SAID THAT
WHAT PRIZE POSSESSION TO ONE PERSON CAN BE AN ABSOLUTE MONSTROSITY TO ANOTHER
BUT NO AND NO MATTER WHAT I SAID ABOUT IT
WOW WHAT A WONDERFUL E TYPE
STAYS IN THE GARAGE
THAT'S JUST ABOUT IT FOR ANOTHER EDITION
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THIS COMES FROM
BUT IT'D PROBABLY BLOW YOUR MINDS SO THE BBC HAS ASKED ME NOT TO
THE DANCE CRAZE AT NUMBER THIRTY FIVE IN OUR CHART IS DEFINITELY ONE FOR THE UNDER FIVES
I LOVE ANTIQUE FURNITURE
I'M GOING TO BUY ONE ITEM
IT'S A GREAT STORY
AND IT GOES TO SHOW THAT CRIME DOES NOT PAY
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
I'VE PUT SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED POUNDS ON IT
THE MARKS ARE LOVELY AND CLEAR
THAT'S THE DECLINE AGAIN
OVERALL MINUS FIVE
WHICH MEANS OVERALL YOU ARE NOW PLUS FORTY
THAT'S MINUS TWELVE
IF IT IS ALL THE SAME TO YOU
TAKE ONE MILLION FRANCS
FOR SOME PEOPLE
THAT DREAM COMES TRUE WHEN AN OLD POT TURNS OUT TO BE WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD ON THE ANTIQUES
BUT HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHICH OBJECT BROUGHT TO A ROADSHOW MADE THE BIGGEST PROFIT
THIS WAS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO
IF THE PERSON IS SURPRISED
YOU HOPE FOR CERTAIN THINGS TO COME IN
OVER YEARS AND YEARS AND IT NEVER HAPPENS
BECAUSE IF I'M TELLING YOU SINCE WORTH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
I CAN REVEAL THAT WE HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE PILOT
AND THAT HAS ITS ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
BECAUSE OF THE COST
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THIS COMES FROM
AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER GREAT SORT REBIRTH IN THE NINETEEN THIRTY S AND THEN AGAIN AFTER THE WAR
IT'S ALWAYS A BIT OF A SHOW STOPPER
HE'S A UM A MAN ABOUT TOWN OR MAYBE SOME YOUNG LAD
IT'S DONALD MCGILL
DO YOU LIKE HIM AS MUCH AS I DO
A SINGLE IMAGE OF A POSTCARD WAS NOT NEARLY AS EXCITING AS A MOVING IMAGE
AND WHEN YOU GOT THE END OF THE PIER PENNY IN THE SLOT MACHINES
WHEN I WAS ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE
AND IT WAS A HUGE INDUSTRY
AND YOU WOULD NEVER GO TO THE SEASIDE IN BRITAIN AND NOT SEND A NAUGHTY POSTCARD HOME AGAIN
SOME OF THEM ARE UNSUITABLE FOR BROADCASTING
I THINK MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE A SORT OF AFTER THE NINE O'CLOCK WATERSHED VERSION OF THE ROADSHOW
BUT JUST RECENTLY
WE'RE ASKING OUR EXPERTS IF THERE'S ONE ITEM THAT'S BEEN POUNCED UPON BY ANOTHER TEAM MEMBER WHICH
IT IS A FASCINATING PROGRAMME
HE MAY ALSO BE A HOROLOGICAL SPECIALIST
A CLASSIC MOMENT FROM THE ARCHIVES
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
BUT THE HATRED WASN'T JUST RELIGIOUS
THE NEW EMPEROR'S BODYGUARD MADE UP OF NORSEMEN AND VIKINGS AND ANGLO SAXON
WOMEN WITHOUT ASKING WHETHER THEY'RE MUSLIM OR GREEK OR CHRISTIAN AND THEY BEHAVE IN A WAY THAT
ALL OF THE CHURCHES DATE BACK MUCH OLDER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN EUROPE AND
AND SO THIS IS WHAT REAL CHRISTIANITY LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE
THAT IS SOMETHING WHICH IS A SOURCE OF GREAT ADMIRATION ON THE ONE HAND
YET STILL AS SHARP AND PREDATORY AS AN EAGLE
WAVING A BANNER
AND THEN THE DRUNKEN KNIGHTS HELD A HOMICIDAL ORGY
EXCEPT THE WOMEN
BUT HE HAD A LOT TO LIVE DOWN
HIS FATHER HAD BEEN A NOTORIOUS COLLABORATOR WITH THE LATINS AND SO
THEODORE WAS SAYING
I'M NOT MY FATHER
THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE WAS ALL ABOUT REALISM
LATIN AND HEBREW AND WRITE PASSIONATE LOVE POEMS TO HIS CONCUBINE MISTRESSES IN COURTLY
THERE WERE ONLY FIVE
I GAVE YOU THE TREASURE AND THE PEOPLE
BUT THE BUILDINGS ARE MINE
AND HE'S ONE OF THE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN COACHING
WHAT HAPPENED WAS
WHICH WAS SOME PIANO LESSONS
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
MY SON HAS STARTED DOING CRICKET AND
FOR A STANDARD BRITISH BUCKLE LIKE THIS WOULD BE ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE
SURPRISING TO FIND SUCH A GADGET IN AN ANTIQUE CENTRE
BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT
THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
BUT FOR THE FUN OF IT
BUT I SPENT A GOODLY PERCENTAGE OF IT
WE' GOING TO CHECK OUT WITH THE AUCTIONEER WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT CHARLIE'S LITTLE LABELS
SHE WILL BE SUFFERING FROM CANVAS RASH
IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT SHE MIGHT BE SINGING ON IT
WHERE EVERY FRIDAY
I COLLECT MY DIVVY
I WOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF HE NOT HIDING THOSE COMMUNIST GIRLS
IF AIR FLICK FINDS OUT
I HAVE TO SHARE MY BEDROOM WITH A RATHER ELDERLY MEMBER OF STAFFOR
THEN WE WILL DIE IN ALE OF BULLETS
THE SERVICE HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED
THE LEADER OF THE COMMUNIST RESISTANCE
I WOULD BE OBLIGED IF YOU WOULD EITHER
AND IT'S VERY STRANGE THAT IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
AND I THINK SHE ACTUALLY LEFT THE ANTIQUES ROADHER RICHER IN HER OWN MIND ABOUT HER PROPERTY
TO TRY TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE
THAT JEWEL'S A SORT OF DISTILLATION OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE FINE AND DECORATIVE ARTS
IN LITERATURE AND IN MUSIC
AND IT'S A VERY HIGH ART FORM INDEED
THEY FIND THEM FAINTLY REPULSIVE
THEY HAVE A POWER ABOUT THEM
ONCE UPON A TIME
AND THAT WAS THE GREAT FUN
TO DEMONSTRATE TO HER WHAT IT MEANT
BUT TOGETHER WE WILL LEARN
SO IT'S ALL STILL OUT THERE
WE DON'T HAVE THAT NOWADAYS
THAT SPELT MY WIFE'S NAME
IN THE HEAD OF THE RING
A LITTLE BLOCK OF HAIR
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT WAS A KEY BROOCH THAT I DID
AND AND THE WEARING OF JET AND AND OF STRANGE MATERIALS LIKE BOG OAK AND VULCANITE
MADE OF HARDENED RUBBER TO SIMULATE JET
AND THAT'S TRUE OF ALL THE OBJECTS WE FIND ON THE ANTIQUE ROAD AND PERHAPS THE BEST THING WE CAN DO IS TO TRY
AND THEN IT REALLY WORKS
ONE OF OUR FAVOURITE CATEGORIES IS CALLED THE GREAT ESCAPE
WHERE OBJECTS VERY NEARLY DIDN'T SURVIVE A TRAUMATIC MOMENT IN THEIR LIVES
FALLEN OFF THE WALL
SHE HAD MENDED IT
I'M LOST FOR WORDS
BUCKINGHAM PALACE CHINA PANTRY
WHERE THE KEEPER OF THE PANTRY
AND THAT WILL SURVIVE OF COURSE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
THE QUEEN HAS NO DISHWASHER
TWO AND A HALF MINUTES ON THE SECOND ROUND
SO LOTS TO PLAY FOR
THANKS FOR WATCHING
ESPECIALLY MAMMAL LIFE
BUT WORKING AS A TEAM
WHEN THE SCALES BECAME IN GREAT DEMAND FOR ASIAN WILDLIFE TRADE
I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE BUT
YOU THINK I'M A TWAT
MORTARED OR BLOWN TO PIECES BY AN IED
LET'S FIND OUT WHICH OF OUR CONTENDERS KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE WHAT
APART FROM THAT
THE FORMAT IS MUCH THE SAME TWO MINUTES ON THE TIME LORD
AND TWO MINUTES ON GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
LET'S SEE HOW YOU DO WITH GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
NOBODY'S SUCCEEDED SO FAR
YOU MEET TOM BAKER
THOUSAND POUND FOR CHARITY
I PLAY CAPTAIN JACK ON DOCTOR WHO AND CURRENTLY I'M FIGHTING OTHER ALIENS AND MONSTERS IN
I'M NICK BRIGGS
THE STRONGEST LINK HAS TO CAST THE DECIDING BUT
I CAME IN FOR TWO EPISODES
I THINK AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUND EACH IS ABOUT RIGHT
BEFORE I HEAD BACK TO THE VALUATION DAY TO FIND SOME MORE ANTIQUES TO PUT UNDER THE HAMMER
AND SHE WAS THEN BASED IN LONDON
AND IT'S TRANSFER PRINTED
WHICH I THINK IS BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
AND IS THERE ANY REASON FOR SELLING THEM
WE HEAR THAT A LOT ON THIS PROGRAMME
THE OLDER THE BETTER YEAH
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE POOL CHARGER
PUTS A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE ON ME
I PREDICT ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
YOU CAN'T GET GREENER THAN ANTIQUES REALLY
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SECOND HAND
TIME FROM THE ISLE OF WIGHT
I'M SORRY I LOST THE PLOT THE OTHER WEEK
ON THE OTHER HAND
DOES ANYBODY REALLY KNOW HIM
WHO IS THE MAN BEHIND THE LAUGHTER
IT'S A WONDERFUL SERVICE
AND AND THAT'S WHAT GOT HIM GOING
LIKE MOST PEOPLE DID
I'D LIKE TO THINK SO
I NOW KNOW WITH HINDSIGHT
THAT WAS TRYING TO BREAK OUT OF THAT MOULD
HE DID NOT WANT TO BE LIKE ANYBODY ELSE
AND HE WANTED TO EXTEND THAT IN A MANNER THAT PERHAPS AT THAT TIME HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FROM THE THIRD ROW
AND HE TOLD ME SOME JOKES
HE WAS MARVELLOUS
WHEN WHEN YOU'RE WAITING TO GO ON
THE GUESTS WERE THE BEATLES
POPPING UP AT PARTIES
HE'S GOT HIS OWN LIFE
HE'LL TURN UP WHEN HE WHEN IT'S NECESSARY FOR HIM TO TURN UP AND DO PUBLICITY OR WHATEVER IT IS
AND SO THEY SHOULD
THEY'VE GOT A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY
HAS PEOPLE LIKE KEN
AND HE WORKS AT WHAT HE DOES FOR A LIVING
I WANTED I WANTED TO BE A GOOD COMEDIAN
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO TRY
THE WORLD OF THEATRE
DRAWING CROWDS AND FILLING THEATRES
WAS AS BIG AS MORE AND WISE
HE DIDN'T CONQUER TELEVISION
HE'S NOT DESIGNED FOR TELEVISION
SO I HAD TO GET A TAXI
THE TAX AFFAIR WAS THERE
DON'T LIKE HIM OR NEVER HEARD OF HIM
YOU JUST CAN'T HELP IT
HE IS STILL THE FUNNIEST
AND THIS WAS ELEMENTS OF HIS WHOLE LIFE BEING BROADCAST
BUT THOSE WHO KNOW KEN AND KNOW THIS SPIRITUAL SIDE TO HIM KNOW THAT HE IS
LIKE MOST PEOPLE
BUT THERE IS A COMPARISON WHERE SINATRA SUITS SOME MEDIUMS MAYBE BETTER THAN OTHERS
IS FRANK SINATRA THE MAN
AND WHEN YOU THINK OF KEN DOT YOU THINK OF KEN DOD THE MAN
AND YOU DON'T THINK OF A TV SERIES
OR YOU DON'T THINK OF A HIT RECORD
HE HASN'T MOVED AWAY
IF ANGELS HAD APPEARED
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
AND I FELT CONSTRAINED IN MY SERMON TO SAY
THAT IF YOU'VE COME HERE TONIGHT TO BE ENTERTAINED BY THE MUSIC
TO LISTEN TO AN INTERESTING SERMON
I THINK YOU MAY BE VERY DISAPPOINTED BUT
BUT IF YOU'VE COME HERE TONIGHT AND ARE LOOKING FOR GOD TO SPEAK TO YOU
THEN MAYBE HE WILL
IT DOESN'T TELL JOKES THAT SCORE POINTS OUT OF PEOPLE
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A JOB
IT'S AN ATTITUDE TO LIFE
I THINK WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET
AS HE WOULD SAY
I CAN KEEP A SECRET
ALFIE IS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH WORRY
I'M TELLING YOU THAT CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT
THEN YOU'RE FREE
I SEARCHED FOR MY FAMILY MY WHOLE LIFE AND I NEVER HAD A DAD BUT A GRANDDA
MAYBE SETTING UP MY OWN BUSINESS
NICK HALL PAID FORTY FIVE
THE STONER FAMILY HERE PAID A HEAVY PRICE
WILL GOD BE SHINING DOWN ON OUR TEAMS' EFFORTS TODAY OVER AT THE AUCTION
BUT DID THEY GIVE UP
PEOPLE CAN OFTEN FEEL AS THOUGH THEY'VE LOST THEIR SENSE OF IDENTITY AND BELONGING
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND MUSIC HAS HELP PULLED ME THROUGH
AND THAT'S WHATS SO GREAT ABOUT THE CHOIR WITH NO NAME
NO MATTER THEIR BACKGROUND
FOR A LITTLE WHILE
SET THEIR WORRIES ASIDE
WHERE YOU CAN DONATE
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET
IF YOU DON'T GET THROUGH STRAIGHTAWAY
PLEASE TRY AGAIN
BUT THERE ARE MANY MORE OUT THERE WHO THEY WANT TO TOUCH WITH THE POWER OF SONG
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S NINE THIRTY
NICE TO MEET YOU BOTH
SO WHAT DO WE DO
AND HE TAKES OLD BITS OF WOOD
CHUNKY CHAIRS OF DISTINCTION AND TABLES MADE OF ABANDONED BITS OF BOATS
IT'S UNIQUE AND IT'S GOT ITS OWN CHARACTER
LET'S CATCH UP WITH STEVE IEL
IT OPENS UP A WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY
AFTER TOUGH TIMES IN THE RECENT PAST
I'LL BE FINDING OUT EXACTLY WHY
FOR DAIRY FARMERS
WE GOT A PARDON
SUCCESS IS ABOUT SUPPLY AND DEMAND
BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE DEMAND THATS DEVELOPED
BUT THE AVERAGE CHINESE CONSUMER HASN'T HEARD OF THESE PRODUCTS
WE GOT RELATIVELY HIGH YIELDS
IT'S ROUGH AND RUGGED
THEY'RE NOTED AS BEING THE FIRST PEOPLE TO BEGIN SURFING
THE ROOM NEXT DOOR TO HERE
THAT'S THE TYPICAL SIZE OF A COMBAT ENGINEER BATTALION
THEY DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPANIES
IT'S A HARD THING TO ACTUALLY SAY
THEY'RE LYING THERE ON THE BEACH
COMPANY B'S FATALITIES
THERE IS A FUTURE THERE BUT IT'S VERY
I WOULD WELCOME THAT
AND THAT INCLUDES GIVING PEOPLE THE CHOICE TO BACK GRASS PRODUCED
WE NEED TO KEEP UP WITH MODERN PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES AND TO PUT TO BE EFFICIENT ON A GLOBAL STAGE
AS DEMAND FOR THE WHITE STUFF GROWS EVER HIGHER
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT A SCOWL IS TURNING TO A SMILE ON THE FACE OF MANY DAIRY FARMERS AND WE'RE
BECAUSE THERE LITERALLY IS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
THEY COST NINE POUNDS BUT AT LEAST FOUR POUNDS OF THAT WILL GO TO BBC CHILDREN IN NEED
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW AND HOW YOU CAN GET HOLD OF ONE IS ON OUR WEBSITE
BUT BEFORE THAT
THAT IS ALL WE'VE GOT TIME FOR FROM NORTH CORNWALL
LASERS AND GLITTER BALLS
WE STILL WANT TO BE INSPIRED
PART OF ITS FURTHER AWAY
WHAT IS NEW ABOUT THIS NEW GENERATION
WHAT IS NEW ABOUT THIS CHARACTER
I NOT ONLY ADMIT THEM
YOU CAN'T JOIN IN
BUT THE DOCTOR NATURALLY FEELS THAT YOU SHOULD
AND PEOPLE ALWAYS USED TO JOKE OH
FOR THE FIRST TIME REALLY
THAT NO MATTER HOW DREADFUL THE ALIENS WERE
CERTAINLY WHO I REMEMBER
THEY ALWAYS SAY
JOHN SIMM WAS VERY LUCKY
QUITE COMFORTABLE REGENERATION
THAT YOU WAIT A LITTLE BEFORE CRITICISING MY NEW PERSONA
WHEREAS FLYING A CONVENTIONAL SINGLE PISTON ENGINE AIRCRAFT
BUT THE ENGINES
YOUNG MEN HAD FLOWN PLANES AGAINST A VISIBLE ENEMY
THERE WAS THIS MYSTICAL FORCE
CAN YOU BREAK THROUGH THE SOUND BARRIER
EVERYBODY KNEW THEM
THEY KNEW THEM AS WELL AS TODAY'S PEOPLE WOULD KNOW THE NAMES OF FORMULA ONE DRIVERS
THE FIRST AIRCRAFT THAT THE ROYAL AIR FORCE HAD THAT WOULD FLY AT HEIGHTS OF FORTY EIGHT
WE BELIEVED AT THE TIME
NOBODY'S GOING TO SELL THEIR STATE SECRETS
YOU WERE NOT USED TO THAT SORT OF THING
THE ENGINE COMPLETELY EXPLODED
THE SEAT WAS DISAPPEARING BELOW
IN ORDER TO REMAIN AN INDEPENDENT GREAT POWER
THEY HAD TO HAVE A WAY OF DELIVERING THEM SO
WHAT DO THEY DO
WHICH WAS VERY IMPORTANT
THE MINISTRY OF TECHNOLOGY
AS IT CAME ABOUT
THE TEST PILOT SAID SO
BRITAIN COULD MAKE IT
A LOT WAS HAPPENING FOR BRITAIN
THAT WAS BEING QUITE SHAMELESSLY PROMOTED ON ALL SIDES
WE WERE COMING OUT OF AUSTERITY
RATION BOOKS WERE SOON TO END
HILLARY AND TENZING CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF MOUNT EVEREST
YOU SAW WONDERFUL
THEY ASSUMED THAT WITH A NEW GENERATION OF PISTON ENGINES
IT WOULD BECOME VERY MUCH MORE EFFICIENT
THEY WERE AFTER THE FIRST CLASS PASSENGERS FROM THE QUEEN MARY AND IF YOU WERE GOING TO CRAM THEM
ALL THAT WENT AND THEY WERE FLYING HIGHER BECAUSE IT WAS A PRESSURISED CABIN
THE MAJOR ADVANTAGE WITH THE TURBOPROP ENGINE
MAYBE NOT IN NUMBERS
IT DID WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO
BECAUSE IT WAS A TURBOPROP RATHER THAN A PURE JET
WHICH IS WHY THE PLANE SOLD IN AMERICA
IT WAS SO LOVELY
WHICH DISTURBED THE AIRFLOW INTO THE ENGINE
YOU JUST NEVER TOOK OFF AT ALL
SLOWLY OR QUICKLY
NOBODY QUITE KNEW
BEING A JET AIRCRAFT
MOSTLY BECAUSE YOU YOU DON'T HAVE THE SLIPSTREAM GOING BACK OVER THE CONTROL SURFACES UNTIL IT'S
IT WAS A TURBOPROP BUT IT WAS QUITE FAST
FOUR HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR
SO IN SOME WAYS
RIGHT TO THE FAR EAST
THE ENTIRE WING WAS IN FLAMES AND KNOWING THAT THERE WERE TWO
THAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY START MELTING THE MAIN SPAR
YOULL FIND PEOPLE
AND IT WAS ALMOST ILLEGIBLE BECAUSE THE IT WAS ALL WATER STAINED AND THE ADDRESS HAD RUN AND EVERYTHING
UP NEAR THE COCKPIT ABOVE IT
WELL WE CAN SEE WHAT WAS WRONG
EXCEPT THAT THE AMERICANS WERE THINKING
WE'RE GOING TO GET ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN SEVEN HOURS FLAT FROM LONDON TO NEW YORK
AND YOU WERE ISSUED WITH THIS PAPER DRESS
EVEN IF IT WAS SNOWING
THEYRE MORE OR LESS ALL THE SAME SIZE
THEY HAD TO BE I THINK TWO OR THREE INCHES ABOVE THE KNEE
THEY BROUGHT US THE SEVEN AH SEVEN
WAS GOING TO DOMINATE AVIATION
SO THE CABIN WAS SUPREMELY QUIET
WHAT A WONDERFUL AIRCRAFT THAT WAS
FOR A NERVOUS PERSON WHO DOESN'T REALLY LIKE FLYING
IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING AIRCRAFT THE VC TANK BECAUSE IT WAS NEAT
WITH HIGH LIFT DEVICES
AND THEN INEVITABLY
THE REASON IT WAS MORE ECONOMICAL TO FLY WAS BECAUSE THE SEVEN ZERO SEVEN HAD BEEN BUILT FOR VERY LONG
TO DO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE WERE TRYING
I SAID CARPETS HAVE IN COMMON
IT'S NOT A JOKE
IT'S THE WORCESTERSHIRE TOWN OF KIDTYMINSTER
DONOVAN AND OF COURSE
INCLUDING THE ROLLING STONES
THERE'S A REAL HISTORICAL GEM
THIS IS INCREDIBLY RARE
YET AT ONE POINT IN OUR HISTORY
IN WHAT WE' NOW CALL THE SUBURBS OF OF BIRMINGHAM YOU KNOW
THANK GOODNESS THIS COURT HAS SURVIVED DEMOLITION
A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR SOCIAL HISTORY WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED
ALONG WITH THE BRICKS AND MORTAR
IT'S GOING TO BE JAM PACKED
AND THIS IS WHERE ALL OUR ITEMS ARE GOING UNDER THE HAMMER TODAY
AND SO THERE SHOULD BE
PAINSTAKINGLY RESTORING SOME OF THE ROCK HOUSES BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL CONDITION AS THEY WERE IN
THAT'S SO RESOURCEFUL AND SO CLEVER
WE CAN SEE THAT
THAT WAS A BIG MOMENT
WE'RE ON A ROLL
WEVE COME TO THE END OF OUR DAY
THE RAF HAVE PROVIDED US WITH A LONG DISTANCE
IS THERE ANY CHANCE OF A POST LA TO TIDE ME OVER
AND THINK OF THE MOTHER
I KNEW YOU WOULD COME TO ME
A MEMORABLE MEETING BETWEEN WONDERFUL OBJECTS
EACH WITH THEIR OWN STORY TO TELL
COLOURFUL CHARACTERS ARE AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT FOR THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW
WHEN I WAS A BIT YOUNGER
COURAGEOUS IS THE RIGHT WORD FOR HER
HE AND HIS PARTNER
AND IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER THROUGH THE POWER OF THE TELEVISION SCREEN
AND THE GREAT THING WAS IT WAS ALL FUN FOR THEM
YOU KNOW ABOUT NEWCASTLE POTRE
I AM COLLECTING
THEY CERTAINLY WEREN'T MADE OF BRASS
WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREAT CITY COMPANIES
AND I ALWAYS REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT IF IT WEREN'T FOR ARTHUR
AND ONE MAN KNEW THE REAL ANTIQUES ROADSHOW
WHERE THERE WERE TWO SHIPS
ONE WAS A SHIP HEADING FOR AMERICA
SO HE SURRENDERED TO CAPTAIN MAITLAND OF THE NAVY
AND HE WAS BROUGHT OVER TO DEVON
AFTER THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO
THIS GREEN MOROCCO LEATHER CASE
AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF THING THAT HE MIGHT HAVE PRESENTED TO SOMEONE IN GRATITUDE FOR A SERVICE
IT IS THEREFORE NOT BEYOND THE REALMS OF POSSIBILITY THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO SOMEONE HERE IN
AND THAT PARTICULAR PERIOD OF HISTORY
AND A MAN WENT TO THE RECEPTION AREA
WHEN SHE LOOKED AT THIS
SO PENNY SAID TO HIM
IF WE GOT YOU A TAXI DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GO HOME AND FETCH THE OTHER THREE
WHICH BRINGS US TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF ANOTHER SHOW
THE ROMANS HAVE STATIONED FOUR OF THEIR BEST LEGIONS IN BRITAIN
AND EFFICIENT FIGHTING MACHINES
TAKEN OVER THEIR TOWNS AND FORCED THEM TO PAY HEAVY TAXES TO SUPPORT THE ROADS
WHILST THE CAVALRY RODE OR SWAM ACROSS THE GAP
THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WERE ORDERED TO MOVE IN AND SEIZE HIS THRONE
BUT FOR THE BRITONS AND FOR BOUDICCA
A COUNCIL OF WAR WAS HELD
THE ELDERS OF THE ICENI TRIBE AND THEIR NEIGHBOURS
JUST FIFTY MILES SOUTH OF HERE WAS THE HATED SYMBOL OF ROMAN RULE
NOW WHICH PUTS ME ABOUT HERE
WE BELIEVE THAT TRUTH
THEIR ONLY HOPE OF RESCUE CAME FROM THE ROMAN ARMY
WE HAD AN ENTIRE LEGION
WE'D HAD TO PAY FOR THAT TEMPLE WITH OUR OWN BLOOD
LONDON WAS A ROMAN BOOMTOWN
IT WAS CENTRED RIGHT HERE IN THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT OF TODAY'S CITY OF LONDON
IT HAD SPRUNG UP FROM NOTHING TO BECOME BRITAIN'S BUSIEST COMMERCIAL CENTRE
HE WOULD NEED AN OPEN PLAIN TO FIGHT ON
BUT THE ONE THING TEUS OMITTED TO TELL US WAS WHERE THE VALLEY WAS
AND THAT'S STILL A MATTER OF DEBATE TODAY
THEY CAN'T BE REMOVED VERY EASILY
THEN THEY WAITED FOR THE BRITONS TO
ARMED WITH SWORDS
THE BRITISH WARRIORS ROARING
HURLING THEIR SPEARS CHALLENGING THE ROMANS TO SINGLE COMBAT
BUCA'S KINGDOM WAS DESTROYED AND WHAT REMAINED OF HER TRIBE WERE FORCIBLY RESETTLED IN A
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A SPECTACULAR ROMAN VICTORY
BUT IT IS STILL ONE OF THE GREATEST HUMAN TRAGEDIES IN BRITISH HISTORY
IF YOU DRIVE A CAR WITHOUT A WINDSCREEN AT FIFTY MILES AN HOUR
WHEN I DROVE DOWN A RAMP
IN THE THIRD CORNER YOU CAME UP THE OUTSIDE
IF YOU ALLOW YOUR SATIF TO STEER YOU INTO A FIELD
CHRIS EVANS OUT OF RADIO TWO SPENT FIVE AND A HALF MILLION OF HIS POUNDS ON A VERY RARE
THIS WAS ALWAYS MY FAVOURITE OF THE CLASSIC FERRARIS
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY
WITH HIS VERSION OF JESSICA
WHAT BATTLES DO THEY FACE
NOW TO JUST OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CASES THIS YEAR
SHE FEELS THAT SHE'S THE ONE WHO'S DONE
SHE'S BEEN MADE TO FEEL THAT SHE'S THE GUILTY PARTY
AND I DO GET RAPED
SHE'S FINE SOCIETY
SHE'S FIGHTING THE MINDSET
IMPACTS ON OUR SOCIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE
YOU SIT DOWN IMMEDIATELY WITH YOUR DAD AND ENGAGE IN RUNNING SOME
THE WORLD'S YOUR ALWAYS
IT'S NEVER ENDED
IT WON'T EVER BE FINISHED
THEN IT'S IT'S QUITE EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY SOME PEOPLE
SOME MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC
IT HAS TO BE SAID
IT DOESN'T COME INTO IT
AND ALSO FOR MARKETING AND PROMOTING
YOU DON'T GET CHANGED OUT OF YOUR SCHOOL OR YOUR WORK CLOTHES
HEALTH AND SAFETY
THOSE WEREN'T TERMS THAT WERE USED AT THE TIME BUT THE RAILWAY COMPANIES WERE PAINTING THEIR
DEVON AND SOMERSET
SO THEREFORE THEY HAD THE BEST POSTERS
THEY HAD GREAT COLOURS
THEY WERE THERE WERE HOUSEHOLD NAMES
THIS ENGINE WAS TRAVELLING AT MORE THAN TWO MILES A MINUTE
AND THIS IS THE PROMOTIONAL MATERIAL FOR THE HOUSES AND THE HOUSING THEMSELVES
THE TRAINS THEMSELVES
I WANTED FUNNY THINGS
I WANTED STRANGE THINGS
INTERNET WASN'T BAD
BUT NOT THAT GOOD
SO WE KNEW IT WOULD HAVE TO BE TOTALLY
TOTALLY HAND BUILT
PUT A ROOF ON IT
MAKE IT LOOK BEAUTIFUL
BUT SOMEHOW YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE ANYBODY COULD LIVE IN IT
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST SOMETHING MISSING
AND THEN YOU CHANGE THE COLOUR SCHEME SLIGHTLY
YOU PUT A DENT IN A FRONT DOOR
EIGHT FOOT LAYOUT ON A BOARD
I WAS THROWN TO PIECES
I MEAN I HAD TO TAKE IT UP TO BED WITH ME AND PUT IT ON THE TABLE BESIDE THE BED
ON TOP OF THE TABLE
AND YOU'VE GOT WINGS AT EITHER SIDE
WE'RE USING A BACKDROP
ALL ARTEFACTS OF THE STAGE
WHICH IS WHAT YOU DO
THAT IT WAS INFALLIBLE
THAT IT WAS HARD WORK
THAT IT WAS FALLING APART
THAT'S THE PART
IF YOU LOOK ROUND THIS LIKE
IT'S ABOUT THE SAME PRIDE
FOR OTHERS AGAIN
IT'S ABOUT MAKING IT SO YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE EVERY PART'S COME FROM
YOU PUT IT ON THE TRACK AND THEN IT'S GOT TO PULL FOURTEEN COACHES
IN A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE
A LOT OF PEOPLE OFTEN FEEL THAT THEY'VE LOST ALL CONTROL
VERY COMPLICATED SOCIAL AND WELL AS WELL AS A TECHNICAL
OR TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEM
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A COUPLE OF WORKING LAYOUTS
THEY GET TOGETHER IN CLUBS AND AT SHOWS
FOR SHARING EXPERIENCES
SO IF YOU ARE HOPELESS AT MODELLING
THAT'S THE TRUTH
WHEN WE GET TOGETHER
IT'S JUST MONKEY
NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES
AND I KNOW THAT'S VERY STEREOTYPICAL
WHERE THEY RELATE TO HIM
INTO RAIL ENTHUSIASM
WHICH ADAM IS VERY KINDLY TAKING US DOWN IN HIS BARGE
BUT OTHERS BECAME VERY RICH
LIKE LOCAL BREWER
CLAUDE REEVES IS KNOWN
AND THEY'RE VERY
I THINK IT'S LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY
AS WELL AS ITS COLOUR
IT'S ABOUT THE NOVICES
FROM WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID
WHICH IS THE EASY BIT TO REMEMBER
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT
A CAPTAIN OF THE MILITIA
AND LATER ON IN HIS LIFE
AND THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T SPARKLE VERY MUCH
SHE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HEAR THAT
MY HUSBAND FOUND THIS IN A DEEP
WHATEVER YOU CALL IT
THAT'S WHAT OUR MISCELLANEOUS EXPERT MARK ALLEN HAS TO MAKE HOUSE ROOM FOR
KENWOOD HOUSE IN NORTH LONDON
AND WHILE THE DAMAGE DONE TO BUILDINGS DURING CONFLICT IS USUALLY EASY TO REPAIR
THE IMPACT ON HUMAN MEMORY IS OFTEN MUCH HARDER TO ERASE
OUR MILITARY EXPERT GRAHAM LAY RECALLS SOME MOVING ENCOUNTERS WITH DESCENDANTS OF PRISONERS
AND OF COURSE IF YOU WERE DISCOVERED
TO SHOW TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC THOSE STORIES THAT THE INDIVIDUAL STORIES
WHAT DID YOU DO IN THE WAR
SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THE ROADSHOW
I'VE DISCOVERED A DIARY OF DAD'S
WHICH WAS IN THE BOTTOM OF A BOX
ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE THEY MUST HAVE PLAYED ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT SPORTS
I WOULDN'T LOOK OUT FOR ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR EXCEPT POSSIBLY SCANDINAVIAN BUTTERFLIES
THERE WERE NO ANIMALS THERE
SOME OBJECTS ARE SO SPECIAL
EVEN BETWEEN FATHER AND SON
DON'T YOU WORRY
THAT'S JUST ABOUT IT
HE WAS THE NATURAL CHOICE TO TAKE OVER AS KING
IF YOURE ONE OF HIS FOLLOWERS
BUT THERE WAS ONE MAN ACROSS THE CHANNEL WITH OTHER IDEAS
DUKE OF NORMANDY
THANKS TO WILLIAM
THERE THEY WERE
THE FACT WAS THAT THE KING OF ENGLAND
EDWARD THE CONFESSOR
IT WAS GOING TO BE THE CRUSHING OF NORWEGIAN SKULLS
THIS WAS OUR TIME
AND AS WE GOT CLOSER
THEY WEREN'T EXPECTING US SO SOON
WHERE SOME OF THE MEN WERE SITTING AROUND RELAXING IN THE SUN
THE VIKINGS WERE EXPOSED TO SAXON STEEL
A PILE OF PLUNDER AND
AND ALL WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS' SAIL OF ENGLAND
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE THEIR LUCK
IT WAS A DEVASTATING BLOW FOR HAROLD
WILLIAM WAS BURNING AND PILLAGING VILLAGES IN THE AREA OF HIS LANDING POINT
HEARING THAT HAROLD WAS ON HIS WAY
AT FIRST NIGHT OF DAWN
JUST A HOUR OR TWO AFTER DAWN
WHERE I'M STANDING
HE WAS ON FOOT IN THE FRONT LINE AND HE COULDN'T RACE OVER ON HORSEBACK TO RESTORE CONTROL
FIGHTING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH HIS MEN
SOME BELIEVE THAT WILLIAM USED THIS LULL TO PLAN A NEW STRATEGY
MEDIEVAL BATTLES WERE SHORT
BUT MORE THAN THAT
SCOTLAND AND IRELAND UNDER THEIR CONTROL
FATHER CHRISTMAS CAN'T BE HERE WITH US TONIGHT BUT
WHO THIS WEEK ARE THE STARS OF PANTOMIME
SO IF YOU'RE WATCHING AND YOU DIDN'T GET ONE
IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE NO LONGER FRIENDS
SO PLEASE STOP BOTHERING ME
FOR PEOPLE YOU'D MOST LIKE TO LEAVE OFF THE CHRISTMAS CARD LIST
DRAWN ON EYEBROWS
I JUST THINK WE'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK ON THIS PERIOD AND THINK WHAT
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO KEEP OUT DUST AND RAIN
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY SAD THAT
LIKES TO HAVE A STICK
HE STARTS TO SOB
IT'S YOUR FAULT
I HAVE CHILDREN AND CERTAINLY WHEN THEY WERE SMALL
THEY WERE ASSAILED BY DOGS
A DOG JUMPED UP ONTO HER PUSH SHE
THE MORE TURKEY
THE BRANDY BUTTER
THE MORE PUDDING
THE MORE BRANDY BUT
AND WE ALL LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CHRISTMAS DINNER
THE SELF LOATHING
SERVE UP YOUR NOMINATIONS
FOR MOST EFFECTIVE POST CHRISTMAS DIET
I WEIGHED MYSELF AND I WAS A STONE MORE THAN HE HAD BEEN IN THE PAST
WERE THERE ANY SIDE EFFECTS TO GOING CARB FREE
THE STOP EATING LIKE A DOG DIET
I JUST THINK THAT THE BEST WAY
THE QUESTION IS MOST EFFECTIVE POST CHRISTMAS DIET
AND I THINK THAT
I HAVE TWO DOGS
I AGREE WITH THAT
IF YOU ARE FEEDING THIS CAT
PLEASE RING THIS NUMBER
AND MY MUM AND DAD BOUGHT ME AND MY BROTHERS A KITTEN FOR CHRISTMAS
IT ESCAPED AND WENT UP THE CHIMNEY
AND SO WE DIDN'T HAVE A CHRISTMAS PRESENT
AFTER ABOUT FOUR DAYS
YOU ARE NOW AN AMBASSADOR OF
YOUR NOMINATION IS A BAT BOX
WHEN I WAS SMALL
AND THEY WENT UNDER THE TREE
WHEN WE DISCOVER THE SPECIAL SKILLS OUR GUESTS NORMALLY KEEP CLOSE TO THEIR CHEST
I CAN CONVINCE A FRENCH PERSON I'M FRENCH
THAT WAS ONE OF THE OTHER REASONS
IT'S TIME TO PUT ALAN'S KNOWLEDGE TO THE TEST
AS HE JOINS ME OVER THERE IN THE CHANGING ROOM OVER THERE
I'M SO GOOD AT FRENCH
BECAUSE SINCE THE MENOPAUSE
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH THE MENOPAUSE HAS DESTROYED JO BRAND'S MEMORY
IT'S TIME TO PUT BIG ROD'S CLAIM TO THE TEST
AS HE JOINS ME OVER THERE IN THE BIT LIKE BLIND DATE
SO THIS IS HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK WE HAVE THREE MEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN
ONE OF THEM IS NOT FRENCH
WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUT A FRENCH WOMAN
WHO'S GOING TO LISTEN TO ROD'S FRENCH SPEAKING
BUT TO MAKE THIS A BIT MORE CHALLENGING
WISHING YOU ALL A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR
IT'S UP TO OUR CONTESTANTS TO FIND ALL THEIR BARGAINS
YEAH A LITTLE BIT OF PRISONER WAR I LOVE THAT
IF YOU CAN TURN THEM A PROFIT ON THAT
THAT WOULD BE GREAT ROB
HE THEN MADE CERTAIN CHANGES TO PERSONALISE AND MAKE THIS MURAL
WHICH MEANS OVERALL
AND THE SUBJECTS OF HIS STUDY WERE PRIMARILY LOCAL FARMHANDS AND FISHERMEN
KODAK BROUGHT OUT THE BOX BROWNIE
AND NEVER LOOKED BACK
FORTUNATELY SHE CAN'T BE HERE TODAY
BUT I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THAT AND I KNOW LILLAN WILL BE AS WELL
AND I WISH I LIVED IN THIS AREA BECAUSE JUST DRIVING FROM PICKERING THIS MORNING
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU SAY THE GEORGIAN PERIOD BECAUSE THERE WERE THREE KING GEORGES
BECAUSE AUTHENTICITY IS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING
RIGHT MOVING ON SWIFTLY
A ROLLING STONE GATHERS NO MOSS
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THEY'LL EVER GIVE UP
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THE SHOW
INCIDENTALLY OPENS UP THE BACK
YOU ARE WEARINGING THE MOST UNUSUAL NIGHT ATTI
NOT THE MARK SOX
I WANT NO PART OF THIS CRAZY PLAN
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
AND MICHAEL ASPE PICKS HIS PERSONAL FAVOURITES FROM THE ROADSHOW ARCHIVES
AT THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE
AND THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW HAS ALWAYS BEEN A MAGNET FOR COLLECTORHOLICS
I THINK WE'RE ALL GUILTY
I THINK WE'VE ALL GOT IT INSIDE US
HE IS ONE OF THE LEADING AUTHORITIES
IT WAS THERE WHEN KENNEDY WAS SHOT
HAVING TO BE INTELLIGENT ABOUT IT
AND WHEN YOU SEE A COLLECTOR
MAYBE THIRTY YEARS ON ONE SUBJECT
I LOVE THAT PRECISION ABOUT COLLECTING
OH THAT THEY WERE PREPARED TO DRIVE
IT GIVES YOU SOMETHING TO DO
BUT MY FIRST REAL LOVE WAS BOOKS
NOT JUST ONE OR TWO
I PROBABLY HAD ABOUT
THAT MAKES ME FEEL A BIT BETTER ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD DOLL COLLECTION
THE EXPERTS WILL HUDDLE ROUND AN OBJECT THAT THEY THINK IS PARTICULARLY SPECIAL
NOT JUST RECORDED
WHERE HE CAME FROM
SOME OF THE MOST FAMILIAR FACES HAVE THE MOST SURPRISING PASSIONS AND PASTIMES
HIS DAY JOB IS OVERSEEING AN EXQUISITE COLLECTION OF PRICELESS GEMS
WHEN HE'S OFF DUTY
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN HE ACTUALLY SAID HE WAS AN UNDERTAKER
DRESSING LIKE THEIR HEROES
HE REPORTED HIS FINDS TO THE MUSEUM OF LONDON
WE LOVE FINDING BURIED TREASURE ON THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW
ONE MAN SAW HIS FAIR SHARE DURING EIGHT YEARS AT THE HELM OF THE PROGRAMME
AND THERE IT WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY IN USE IN THE OLD PALACE OF WESTMINSTER
WHEN IT GOT BROKEN
IT WAS DITCHED IN THE THAMES AS RUBBISH
IT WAS JUST WONDERFUL
THANKS FOR MANY HAPPY HOURS
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY
THIS IS ANOTHER WORLD
VISITORS TO THE SHOW AND SPECIALISTS ALIKE CUT QUITE A DASH OVER THE YEARS
IT WAS RACIAL APARTHEID
A WELSH NOBLE HAD SOME OF HIS LAND HERE IN NORTH EAST WALES SEIZED BY AN ENGLISH NEIGHBOUR
IT WAS AN ACT OF THE UTMOST DEFIANCE
THE DAMAGE AMOUNTED TO TWELVE
TAKE SOMETHING BACK
THEY WERE FIGHTING ON FRIENDLY TERRITORY
AND FIGHTING A DIFFERENT KIND OF ENEMY
THE STAB YOU IN THE BACK
RATHER THAN STAND UP AND FIGHT YOU PROPER
BUT HE WAS NOT GOING TO LET THE WELSH HUMILIATE HIM AND GET AWAY WITH IT
A FRIEND OF MINE WAS IN TOWN
AND THEY COULDN'T MARRY AN ENGLISH PERSON
ARCHERY WAS COMPULSORY
BOYS AS YOUNG AS SEVEN WERE TOLD TO TRAIN WITH ROCKS TO BUILD THEIR MUSCLES
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN FORMIDABLE MEN
NOW THEY MOVED INTO THE ATTACK
WHATEVER BUT THIS WAS AN OPEN BATTLE AGAINST AN ENGLISH ARMY AND WE WON
THE ENGLISH ARMY COMMANDER
WAS CAPTURED AND HELD FOR RANSOM
ABANDONED BY THE KING
SO THE KING DECIDED NOT TO PAY MORTIMER'S RANSOM
HE COULD HARDLY HAVE MADE A BIGGER MISTAKE
GULPING FOR AIR
ONE OVER HERE TO THE EAST AND ONE OVER HERE TO THE WEST
KING HENRY'S FORCES
ACROSS THE PLANE
AT THE AGE OF FIFTY
EXHAUSTED AFTER A DECADE OF REBELLION
THEY'RE MADE IN THE SAME WAY AS CHAMPAGNE
AT THE HEART OF THE STORY IS THE FAMILY MEAL
WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN VERY NICE IN A POSH HOUSE LIKE THIS ONE
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE A DELICIOUS DISH UP YOUR SLEEVE THAT CAN BE MADE IN ADVANCE AND SERVED UP AT ANY
CHOOSING THE RIGHT WINE FOR YOUR MAIN COURSE IS OFTEN THE LAST THING ON YOUR MIND
OR YOU COULD GO FOR A CABERNET MERLO BLEND FROM ELSEWHERE
FOOD HAS TO BE AN ADVENTURE
ENTIRELY OF YOUR OWN CREATION OR CUTTING EDGE
EVER SINCE I FIRST SET FOOT ON ARCTIC SEA ICE
IT'S MORE PLASTIC AND SOFT
WHEN YOU GET ICE IN THE SKY
PEOPLE HAVE FOUND A LOT DEEPER
SO AS WE GO INTO AN ICE AGE
THE LEVELS OF CARBON DIOXIDE
AND EVEN GIVING US WARNINGS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR WORLD
GET THE SPROUTS AND BOIL THEM EARLY
THAT'S AN INVASION OF PRIVACY
HE'S HERE TEMPORARILY
I'LL BE STANDING THERE CLAPPING LIKE A SEA LION ON SPEED
EXCEPT FOR THE VIRGIN BIRTH
MY REDSER ASKED ME THAT ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE HE DIED
WHAT WILL I BE IN THE NATIVITY PLAY
I THINK I'D LIKE SOME FRIED BRIE CHEESE WITH SOME CRANBERRY SAUCE
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
CHILDREN JUST MOAN
GET YOUR FOOT OFF ME TRO
WHAT SHALL WE DO
LET'S HAVE AFTERNOON TEA
FROM ITS HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
IT WAS THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE END OF TWO VERY DIFFERENT ROYAL MARRIAGES THAT HELPED SEAL
SO WHILE WE MAY OVER TO THE AUCTION ROOM
WE' GOING TO LEAVE YOU WITH A LITTLE REMINDER
AND AND AS THOMAS KNOWS
THERE SOME GOOD ONES AND SOME POORER ONES
RIGHT LET'S SEE IF THIS NEXT LOT GETS THE SEAL OF APPROVAL
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AND QUITE FRANKLY I WOULDN'T WANT TO
A TRIP UP IN A STATE OF THE ART MICROLIGHT AIRCRAFT
LEARN AND APPLY
AND I TELL YOU WHAT
I CAN SEE THIS DOING TWO
AWAY FROM THE ROOM
IT'S JUST ABOUT TO START
AFTER AN EXCITING CHASE
OUR REGULAR PIANIST
I AM IN THE AUTUMN OF MY LA
HAS JUST BEEN ARRESTED BY THE GESTAPO
ON SUSPICION OF CONCEALING NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM
ALL IS NOT LOST
IT IS THE WORRY ABOUT THE WAR
AND HOPING THAT YOU WILL WIN
I HAVE MOVED MY ROOM
IT IS SIGNED BY HEINRICH HIMMLER
ME AND MY MEN WE ALL ITALIAN WAR HEROES
IT MIGHT HAVE WON THEM A QUICK VICTORY
IT WAS AN EFFECTIVE DEFENSIVE FORMATION
AND ONE AFTER THE OTHER
THE AGILITY OF THE BOATS
IT WAS A PROFITABLE NIGHT FOR DRAKE
WITHOUT HIS LENTERN TO GUIDE THEM
THEY WERE VERY TOP HEAVY AND CUMBERSOME
LATER THAT MORNING
THE WIND AT LAST PICKED UP
DRAKE AND HOWARD MET TO PLAN THEIR ATTACK
IT WAS A NAVAL COMMANDER'S WORST NIGHTMARE
AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT
IT WAS THE JOB OF THE SOLDIERS TO FIRE THE GUNS BUT
BUT THEY HAD NO EXPERIENCE OF FIGHTING AT SEA
FOR MOST OF THE BATTLE
ONE SPANISH SHIP HAD BEEN SUNK
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CERTAIN DEATH
BY THE TIME THE FLEET ARRIVED OFF ISLAND
THE LESS HE'LL HAVE TO PAY
THE MEN'S COMMANDERS
DRAKE AND HOWARD
IT IS SAID THAT
THERE IS NO WAY
YOUR FIRST MONTH'S WAGES
BRIGHT OUTLOOK ON LIFE
WHICH IS FANTASTIC LIKE
WE'VE GOT FIVE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
HE WAS IN A PILE ON THE FLOOR AT THE END OF MY BED
I WAS ON BENEFITS
I RENDER WENT REALLY WELL
IT WAS HARD FOR US AT THAT TIME
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE
BECAUSE I'M SAVING UP
AND UM SORT OF WHAT SORT OF FIGURE ARE WE LOOKING AT
THIS IS GETTING BORING
AND I MANAGED TO DESTROY IT
IF WE ARE ASKED TO ASSIST
DUE TO THE DAMP WEATHER
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
MY INFIRMARY HAS THE LOWEST RECORD OF ADMISSIONS
HAR WORDS IN THIS SEASON OF PEACE AND GOODWILL TO ALL MEN
YOU'LL BE ON THE OUTSIDE AND WE'VE
A BLANK PASSPORT
YEAH I ENJOY A GOOD SING
WHAT IS HE UP
IT WOULD DO TWO THINGS
HE SHOULD BE FIRST ASLEEP BY NOW
BUT HE'S JUST NOT BIG ENOUGH
I'M GOING TO GO AND FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS PLACE
THE ARBORETUM IS PLANTING THREE HUNDRED NEW ONES EVERY YEAR
UM WE'VE NEVER HAD TO CLOSE THE TRAIL FOR ANYTHING
I'M WALKING ALONG
HE MAY SIT ON AH ON A FENCE POST OR SOME ROCK OR SOMETHING
I CAN PICK UP SOME GIFTS TO ADD A LITTLE EXTRA JOLLITY TO CELEBRATIONS AT THE ARBORETUM
IT'S A TIME LIKE NEVER BEFORE
NO IT FEELS EXACTLY THE SAME
GETTING ROUND THE TABLE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR FAMILY AND MAKING MERRY
WHICH IT KIND OF IS
SO FOR INSTANCE
THE CHRISTMAS TREE WHICH IS EVERGREEN
THAT MIGHT SOUND A BIT CRAZY
WELL BEST TO TRY AND KEEP IT WARM AND THEN CALL SOMEONE LIKE CAROL OR MARY TO GET HELP
BUT SHOULD YOU FIND A FULLY GROWN HEDGEHOG THAT IS HIBERNATING COSILY SOMEWHERE SAFE
THAT'S THE BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT ANY HE SHOT COULD HAVE
AFTER YOU'VE HARVESTED WHEAT IN THE SUMMER
BE VERY CAREFUL
IN TERMS OF MONUMENTAL SCULPTURE
AND I FIND THAT PARTICULARLY MOVING
MYSELF AND MY WIFE
WE RECEIVED THAT ORDER OF SERVICE WHEN WE ARRIVED AND WE HAD A VERY ROUGH IDEA OF SOME OF THE SONGS
WE WERE PUTTING A BLOCK TOGETHER
BUT I FIND SMALL COLLECTIBLES
SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO
I CAN'T REALLY TELL YOU MUCH MORE ABOUT THEM
FROM EDINBURGH AND THE ANTIQUES RO TEAM
IT WAS A BELTER
DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK
WATCH MY LIPS IT IS PRIVATE
AND YOU REMEMBER WHAT SHE SAID
I DON'T HAVE NONE OF THEM IN MY HOUSE
NO BLOODY THANKS
HAVE YOU SEEN IT
I THINK IT'S TIME TO GET THE DOORS OPEN AND GET THE SHOW ON THE ROAD
I THINK IT'LL PROBABLY
WHOS IT GOING TO BE
TO PROTECT YOUR INTEREST
WHICH IS YOU KNOW A FEW MILES AWAY
BUT IT SURVIVED ALL OF THAT AND
THE HOUSE AND THE GROUNDS WERE DESIGNATED AN ANCIENT MONUMENT
WHEN YOU'RE BROWSING AROUND AN AUCTION ROOM
ALWAYS BUY A CATALOGUE
I'M FEELING REALLY POSITIVE
THERE ARE SO MANY TREE COLLECTORS OUT THERE AND I KNOW A LOT OF THEM WOULD LOVE THIS AS PART OF
THANK YOU SO MUCH
IN CHINESE CULTURE
SUCCESS AND CONTROL
I CAN SPEND HOURS BROWSING IN AN AUCTION ROOM
BECAUSE I USED TO GO FLY FISHING WITH MY FATHER AN AWFUL LOT IN SOMERSET
AND IT'S POSSIBLY THE BIGGEST SPORT IN THE WORLD
YOU'RE SELLING THIS
WE HAVE BEEN CALLING IT A BRONZE VESTA CASE BUT
YOU'VE GOT TO COME TO ONE OF THESE
WHICH IS WHAT I DO
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE
I'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S WORTH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED
PAN AND I TOLD HIM WHAT IT WAS AND I SAID
I WENT BEHIND A PILLAR AND WATCHED THE SAL AND
THIS IS TERRIBLE
YOU THINK IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ANYTHING IN COMMON WITH THEM
HAVING SAID THAT
HE WANTS TO DO HE WAS GOING TO DO THE OLYMPICS AND WOULD I LIKE TO JOIN HIM
AND I THOUGHT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A SPORTS MOVIE
HE HAD A SMALL TEAM
HE PUT TOGETHER THE TEAM HE WOULD HAVE PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE A MOVIE
MARK HAD THIS IDEA THAT YOU KNOW WE COULD FAKE UP THE QUEEN JUMPING OUT OF A HELICOPTER
COULD WE REPRESENT THE QUEEN IN THAT WAY
AND WHEN THE MESSAGE CAME BACK
YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CELEBRITY TO TAKE PART IN THE REGULAR MASTERMIND PROGRAMME SO IF YOU'D LIKE
THANKS FOR WATCHING
I HAVE AN ABSOLUTE CRISIS NEXT
GOODWILL TO ALL MEN
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE
ON BEHALF OF THE DEAN AND CHAPTER
MOST OF OUR WORK HERE AS MINOR CANONS IS IN ORGANISING SERVICES THAT PEOPLE WILL COME TO HERE
SO WE'RE EXTREMELY USED TO INTERNAL LIAISON AND TO EXTERNAL LIAISON WITH OUTSIDE
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO COME HERE FOR A SPECIAL SERVICE
BUT IT'S QUITE UNIQUE TO BE ORGANISING SOMETHING THAT NOT ONLY IS NOT IN THE ABBEY AND NOT IN
ONCE THE ABBEY WAS REESTABLISHED AS IT IS TODAY
AS A COLLEGIATE CHURCH WITH A DEAN AND CHAPTER
BECAUSE WE ARE SO LUCKY HERE
TWO MILLION PAYING VISITORS LAST YEAR AS WELL AS THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
ONE DAY YOU'RE AT A ROYAL WEDDING
SO ON BEHALF OF THE DEAN AND CHAPTER I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A VERY
SO IT'S VERY EXCITING
AND SO WE SAT DOWN HERE AND WITH JAMES O'DONNELL TO TALK ABOUT MUSIC
WE SAT DOWN WITH MY COLLEAGUE MIKE TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE SERVICE MIGHT WORK
AND I BEING QUITE FASCINATED BY THAT
WAS VERY BALANCED
WAS VERY SENSIBLE
AND THAT KIND OF SUMS UP THIS PLACE
IT'S MY JOB TO GIVE THEM QUITE A HARD TIME
WE'RE IN THE BIG TIME
ALL TAKEN CARE OF
YEAH I THOUGHT AS MUCH
WE'VE GOT NO MONEY
IT'S MOST PROBABLY RIDICULOUS
YOU CAN'T HAVE AN ITALIAN NU
WE HAD A TROPICAL STORM
FIRST TIME FOR EVERY
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT STUFF
I DID NOT INVITE YOU
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S SOMETHING WHICH CAN BE QUITE POMPOUS ABOUT IT AND QUITE SORT OF HAUGHTY AND
IN NEW REGULATIONS PUT INTO FORCE TODAY
I'M BUSY AT THE MOMENT
AND CERTAINLY WE WEREN'T GOING TO GO INTO THAT WORLD
AND WEREN'T PART OF THAT GENERATION
AND WE DIDN'T THINK WE COULD DO WHAT THEY DID
SO WE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
WHICH WAS TO DO SOMETHING VERY LOW KEY
THIS FILM IS A HIGHLY DISTASTEFUL ONE I MEAN
HE WANTED TO ACT OUT
GET THEE BEHIND ME
IF YOU TURN THE SOUND DOWN YOU CAN'T TELL SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO BE FUNNY
AND I REMEMBER LOTS OF THE SKETCHES THAT WE DID TOGETHER
LIKE THE ORIGAMI SKETCH
I REALLY MEAN THIS
GERALD DID MAKE VARIOUS ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT HIS OLD FLANGE OF GORILLAS
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE OUT OF A JOB
SO WE MADE A PILOT
FOR VARIOUS REASONS
BLOODY VAN BROKE DOWN
I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEF YOU AS TO THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS
THAT WAS THAT WAS A CLASSIC SORT OF MEL
I THINK YOU BELIEVE THAT SOMEWHERE IN SOME PUB SOMEWHERE
OBVIOUSLY A VERY DARK
BECAUSE HERE AT THE BBC FOR EXAMPLE IT'S ACTUALLY A POSITIVE ADVANTAGE TO BE WORKING CLASS
HE'D BEEN VERY AMUSED BY THIS
HE'D BEEN ROUND TO SEE HER THE DAY BEFORE
AND PEOPLE SAID
WALKED AROUND THE SCHOOL VERY
THRUST A LARGE GIN AND TONIC INTO MY HAND
AND I PRETTY SOON REALISED IT WAS ACTUALLY MY COPY OF TOMMY
THIS ROUND
THAT I'M GOING TO BE WORLD FAMOUS
AND THEN WITHIN A YEAR OR SO HE WAS VERY
YOU'RE KIDDING ME
THEY SAW THAT BY TAKING THEIR DESTINY INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND CREATING A PRODUCTION COMPANY THEY
AND GRADUALLY WE WOULD THEN START TO BE SUCCESSFUL
AH TO TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD
MY IMAGE OF HIM
AH SO WHATEVER HE SAID
VERY IMPORTANT IN OUR DAY
ON SOMETHING DIFFERENT
USED HIS LEISURE TIME VERY
AND THAT'S ONE OF HIS GREAT JOYS
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF HIS FIVE A DAY
I WAS BADLY SMITHED LAST NIGHT
BECAUSE IF YOU WENT OUT FOR A DRINK IT WOULD TURN INTO A VERY LONG NIGHT ALWAYS ENDING ENDING UP
SO IT'S A KIND OF HYBRID
THERE WAS ALWAYS HAD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CASH FROM THE WORD GO
HE WENT OUT AND BOUGHT HIMSELF A NEW ROLLS ROYCE
HE WAS VERY GENEROUS WITH IT
AND MEL NAMED HIM AFTER THE CHECK
BACK AND PEOPLE WOULD COME UP AND GO
BUT WE WE WE DRANK THE WHOLE TRAIN DRY ON THE WAY BACK
AS EVERYTHING HAS BECOME MORE CORPORATE
AND THEN IT'S INTERESTING THAT AFTER THE FILM DIRECTING
HE CAME BACK AFTER THE FIRST NIGHT
I MET HAROLD VOIGHT FROM THE CECIL THE OTHER DAY
THERE WAS A SERENITY
BUT THERE WAS A SERENITY AS HE SAT THERE READING BOOKS AND HE WAS VERY HAPPY TO BE PART OF THIS
TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN PAID TO THE COMEDIAN MEL SMITH
WHO'S DIED SUDDENLY AT HIS HOME IN LONDON AFTER SUFFERING A HEART ATTACK
SO IN A WAY YOU'RE NOT
AND HE WAS CHECKING WITH ME THE TIME OF THE RACE THAT WE HAD A HORSE RUNNING THE NEXT DAY
PART OF MY LIFE WORKING WITH MEL
THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT
AND HAD WE PICKED A JOCKEY
WILL YOU DO THIS
UM AND WHICH WAS THAT JOCKEY
WHERE WE BEGIN TO CELEBRATE THE WONDERFUL GIFT THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US IN THE CHRIST CHILD
THE WONDERFUL SENSE OF HIS LOVE FOR US
TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AND FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
WHO COME HERE TO WORSHIP
BRINGING SALVATION TO ALL
AND IN THE PRESENT AGE TO LIVE LIVES THAT ARE SELF CONTROLLED
UPRIGHT AND GODLY
WHILE THEY WERE THERE
AND LAID HIM IN A MANGER
BUT THE ANGEL SAID TO THEM
WHO IS THE MESSIAH
OR PERHAPS OF THE FARMYARD
WAS PAINTED BY A VENETIAN ARTIST
THAT THOUGHT TOOK ME RIGHT BACK TO THE STABLE ITSELF
AND THE BIRTH OF THE BABY JESUS
WHOM WE WORSHIP AND ADORE AS LORD
THE WONDERFUL COUNSELLOR
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND AROUND THE WORLD
AND WE COME TO SING PRAISE TO GOD AND TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
AS WE THINK OF MARY IN THE PAIN OF CHILDBIRTH
HE HIMSELF WAS NOT THE LIGHT
YOU CAN HEAR THE PAIN OF THE PSALMIST
WITH BLESSED MARY
SAINT EDWARD AND ALL YOUR SAINTS
IN YOUR ETERNAL KINGDOM
CAUSE I'M NOT PHIL
AND SHES RIGHT
IF YOU WALK AWAY NOW AND I GET CAUGHT
BUT IF I WRAPPED THEM AND SOLD THEM AS LUXURY CRACKERS
SHE SAID THAT EVERYONE IS SO BUSY AT CHRISTMAS
WHY DON'T WE HAVE A CHRISTMAS NIGHT FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS BEFORE CHRISTMAS
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW
I SPOKE TO BONO
IF YOU'RE NOT GOOD
I HOPE HE WON'T MIND
I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE SOMETHING BEGINNING WITH F
EARTHQUAKE IN LONDON
HOW DO YOU KNOW
YOU NEED TO MAKE AN EFFORT
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A GO AT DOING A CHARADE
THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES DO AT CHRISTMAS
AND WITH YOUR COAT PENS LATER ON
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN YOUR LETTER
YOU KEEP IT BETWEEN YOU AND SANTA
WHICH DOESN'T HAVE MANY GOOD IDEAS BUT
WELL IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE
AH HE'S GOT HIS ALLOTMENT
LIKE A CLOUT ROUND THE EARS
I'M ON YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE
BLACKPOOL IN FEBRUARY
WE WERE BOTH ON THE REBOUND FROM AN EMOTIONAL CRISIS
LOOKING FOR THE OMENS
READING THE FUTURE
THEY USED TO DO IT WITH CHICKENS' ENTRAILS BUT
IF IT'S THERE HOW CAN YOU SEE THAT YOU'VE GOT A RAT
LIFE IS A MYSTERY
I'M AFRAID YOU'VE BEEN CRUSHING YOUR FOLLICLES
ESPECIALLY OUT OF BUSINESS HOURS
WHY IS IT NOBODY EVER ASKS ABOUT HOW I AM
THEY'RE STAUNCH POTTED MEAT ROUND HERE
YOU COME STRAIGHT OUT WITH IT
IT WAS A HELL OF A ROMANCE
SHE THINKS EVERYBODY NEEDS PROTECTING FROM MEN
HE'LL GIVE YOU ALL SORTS OF OLD TWADDLE
DON'T BE LOOKING AT HIM SOFT
A SMALL SHOPKEEPER HAS TO BE RESPONSIBLE
AND I'VE STILL GOT THE SADDLE SORES TO PROVE IT
HE WAS NEVER ONE FOR MIXING BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE
FOR A GENUINE SOULMATE OF STRICT FINANCIAL PROBITY
ONE MUST BE REALISTIC
TO YOU I AM ALWAYS AVAILABLE ON A CONSULTANCY BASIS
AND THERE COULD BE MORE
WHEN YOU SAY BACK
THIS STUFF HAS A DOUBLE WHAMMY
YOU GET YOUR GENERAL HEALTH STIMULUS
I TELL YOU WHAT
THIS WILL TRANSFORM YOUR NIGHTS
BECAUSE WAY BACK THEN
I DON'T THINK I'VE GOT THAT PARTICULAR BUTTER
WE'RE NOT ALL BARBARIANS
WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
THE COMPANY SAID
THE PADDLES ARE PUT AWAY
NO ONE'S GETTING POINTS TONIGHT
IT'S HAPPENING HERE AGAIN CHRISTMAS
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT
DECORATIONS TO PUT UP
PART TO GO TO
TALKING ABOUT CHRISTMAS
ALWAYS TAKES THE FORM OF AN EGG AND
ALL SET TO ENJOY THE DAY
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT
YOU'RE SO FUNNY
I CAN'T STAY LIKE THIS
I'VE I'VE GOT TO RELAX
FOR THE PERFECT CHRISTMAS
BUT IT CAN'T BE JUST ANY OLD TREE
IT'S GOT TO BE THE ONE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT
OVER YOU'RE RIGHT
THE RUN UP TO CHRISTMAS IS LIKE A MILITARY OPERATION
TINSELLY COMMUNION IN THE BOSOM OF THE FAMILY
LET'S BE HONEST
THAT'S ONE WAY OF GETTING YOUR BAUBLES INTO THEM HARD TO REACH PLACES
TEN OFFICE PARTIES FIVE
IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR MOST OF US
COME CHRISTMAS EVE
THE HARD WORK'S DONE AND IT'S ALL DOWNHILL TO ALBERT SQUARE
BUT IF YOU WEAR YOUR COLLAR BACK TO FRONT
THINGS CAN GET VERY STRESSFUL
EVEN THE MOST RIGHTEOUS AMONG US CAN SNAP LIKE A COMMUNION WAFER
I PUT ME STOCKING UP AND ALL I'VE GOT WAS A PAIR OF ODOR EATERS
I HOPE I GET WHAT I WANT THIS YEAR
LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO FLEX OUR VOCAL CORDS WITH A GOOD OLD CHRISTMAS SING SONG
GOOD KING WUSLAS
YOU NEED A FEW LITTLE NIBBLES TO ACCOMPANY ALL THAT DRINK
MAYBE A LIGHT BREAKFAST
SOME SAUSAGE ROLLS AND STILTON FOR ELEVENSES
THEN I LIKE TO EASE OFF A BIT
JUST A FEW MINCE PIES
AS I GEAR UP FOR THE BIG ONE
I CALL IT TURKEY
GRAVY THAT YOU CAN STAND YOUR SPOON UP IN
YOUR TURKEY CAME FROM THE BUTCHERS
AND NO ONE REALLY CARED WHERE IT HAD BEEN BEFORE THAT
AS LONG AS IT WAS PLUMP AND DEAD
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BIRD
THAT'S GOT TO BE HAPPY
GOOD LUCK TO IT
YOU ENJOY YOURSELF
BUT YOU'RE STILL GOING TO END UP PLUCKED AND STUFFED COME CHRISTMAS
IT'S TIME FOR TOP OF THE PULS
AND IN HONOUR OF THIS GREAT YORKIDE INSTITUTION
AND EVERY YEAR SINCE
A GRATEFUL NATION HAS GATHERED ROUND THE SET TO LISTEN WITH RESPECT AND REVERENCE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
ALL RISE FOR HER MAJESTY
LOOK BACK OVER THESE LAST TWELVE MONTHS
WE REFLECT AND SAY
YOU KNOW IT WAS FORTY FIVE MINUTES
THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE QUEEN'S SPEECH AND DOCTOR WHO IS GIVEN OVER TO OUR GREAT NATIONAL
SOME PEOPLE REALLY DON'T LIKE CHRISTMAS
I TELL YOU WHAT THEIR PROBLEM IS COLD COCKLES
HERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAD WARM THE COCKLES OF THE COLDEST HEART
WARMS YOU RIGHT UP
LET'S GO OUT FOR A NICE STROLL
YOU'D BETTER CALL A TAXI
HAD AN ARGUMENT
I DON'T SUPPOSE THERE'S ANYTHING ON THE TELLY
THERE NEVER IS AT CHRISTMAS
I'VE LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT
AND I HOPE YOURS HAS BEEN AS PERFECT AS MINE
THAT WAS MY PERFECT CHRISTMAS
IT HAD ITS HIGHS
WAY TOO MUCH TO EAT
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT
AND THE OTHER HALF COULDN'T GIVE A SHIT IF WE DIED RIGHT HERE AND NOW
I'LL BE ON THE FIRST HELI BACK TO BASTION
I THINK IT'S FUCKING FUNNY
WE'D HAVE A WHALE OF A TIME
SO NOW YOU KNOW
INTRIGUE AND BLOODTHIRSTY BATTLES
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO FIND OUT
AND I DO MEAN HUNDREDS
ALL SETTLED INTO THE GRAND HALL
AND IT LOOKS LIKE CATHERINE SOUTHERN HAS MADE A VERY
VERY GOOD START
I DON'T MIND THIS ONE
AND FIX THE RESERVE AT ONE TWENTY
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT TOMORROW
WITHOUT THE INTERNET
THEY CAN HEAR ME
TIME AND TIME AGAIN
THE BIGGER THE ITEM DOESN'T NECESSARILY COMMAND THE HIGHER PRICE
I'M GOING TO BE FINDING OUT ABOUT THE MAN WHO DESIGNED THIS IMMENSE BEAST
DEPENDING UPON YOUR VIEWPOINT
WAS EITHER A FORWARD THINKING GENIUS
HE OWNED LAND IN SEVERAL COUNTIES
YOU WERE THE ENEMY
THE DANGER PETERED OUT
STRONGEST CASTLE POSSIBLE
BECAUSE HE COULD
A MEDIEVAL SHOW OFF
WHATEVER THE REASON
BY THE MID FOURTEENTH CENTURY
AND INTO THE HANDS OF VARIOUS OWNERS
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CIVIL WAR IN THE SIXTEEN FORTY S
WE SEE A LOT OF THINGS ON THE SHOW THAT DATE BACK TO THE SIXTEENTH
SOMETIMES THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
YOU WANT TO SEE
BUT I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THE SHOW
SEE YOU NEXT TIME
NOW WE NEED EIGHT HUNDRED TO TWELVE
AND THE NAME OF THE STEWARD THAT CUT THAT
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY
THE STEWARD TO LORD ABINGTON
I KNOW IT SOUNDS SILLY
BUT BACK IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND
THAT'S SENSIBLE MONEY
AT THE AGE OF THIRTY EIGHT
RIGHT DOWN TO THE FURNITURE THEY PRODUCED
IT'S JUST A FUNCTIONAL LITTLE SIDE TABLE OR CANDLE STAND
GET IT OUT OF THE WAY
BECAUSE THEY HAD TO SHARE THEIR TOOLS
VERY GOOD TO US
I JUST DO NOT KNOW
TO CLAIM THAT HONOUR THEY MUST FACE ONE AND HALF MINUTES ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT
TWO MINUTES ON GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
THAT'S WHAT I THINK
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG TO ASK ME
SOME SEVEN YEARS NOW
THE IDEA BEING TO GET ORDINARY MERE MODELS OFF THE SOFA TRYING SOMETHING NEW
SOMETIMES NEW INITIATIVES BY MAINSTREAM SPORTS
WITH BRICKS WELL
LITTLE STONES AND BI LIDS DUSTBIN LIDS
THANKS FOR WATCHING
THIS'LL BE THE SHOULD BE THE FIRST TIME
PEOPLE OF SURREY
PASS THE SEMOLINA PUDDING
CHEERED THEM UP NO END
NEAR THE HAYSTACK
SAY FOR WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO RECEIVE
YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
DON'T USE OILY FISH BONES
AND EVEN SOME VERY GELATINOUS FISH IS NOT GOOD
AND IF YOU WANTED SOMETHING MORE FORMAL OR FLASHY
HOW OFTEN DO YOU COOK TURKEY
BESIDES AT CHRISTMAS
SO HERE'S A FEW TIPS TO MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER
MAKE SURE YOU BRING YOUR TURKEY OUT THE NIGHT BEFORE SO IT COMES UP TO ROOM TEMPERATURE
I LIKE TO WRAP MY BIRD IN FOIL SO IT'S LIKE A BIG POCKET ROUND IT
LOTS OF BACON AND PUT SOME WATER INTO YOUR ROASTING DISH SO IT LIKELY STEAMS YOUR TURKEY
THEN JUST BEFORE ITS READY TO GO
UNWRAP THE TURKEY FROM THE FOIL AND ALLOW IT TO ROAST SO YOU HAVE THAT BEAUTIFUL
ALL THESE THINGS CAN BE ADDED IF WE WANT
AND THE POINT OF IT WAS JUST TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS NO LIQUID
NO WATER WHATSOEVER IN HIS BACON
I'M GOING TO MAKE A VERY
AND I HOPE YOU ALL ENJOYED IT
THANKS AGAIN TO OUR WONDERFUL CHEFS AND I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN NEXT TIME
OF COURSE IT IS
I MATTER OF FACT
YOUR GP REFERRED YOU TO US
JUST ONE REALLY NICE DAY
BECAUSE I'M NOT PHIL
AND SHES RIGHT
GET HER TO TALK TO THE POLICE AGAIN
REDO THE INTERVIEW
SO IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM
BUT WE DO HAVE A PUB TO OPEN
DON'T BE A HERO
YOU'RE MEANT TO BE A SMART BOY
I DESERVE TO WIN THIS SHOW BECAUSE I AM SIMPLY BRILLIANT AT EVERYTHING
I DESERVE TO WIN THE SHOW BECAUSE I'M A WINNER
JUST LIKE THE FORMULA ONE DRIVER WHO WON THE TWENTY TWELVE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP
WHICH WAS THE FASTEST DRIVER
I WAS BORN IN SOLIHULL
IT'S A GREAT DAY OUT
I SHALL NOW NAME ALL EIGHT US STATES BEGINNING WITH M
WHATEVER IT WAS YOU DID TO RAISE MONEY GETTING DOLLED UP IN FANCY DRESS
SIMPLY PICKING UP THE PHONE
ALONG WITH THE DANGEROUSLY HANDSOME STEVE JONES AND MY OTHER REINA DAY COMRADES
MIRANDA HART AND DAVID WILLIAMS
WE'LL BE LETTING YOU KNOW HOW THE MONEY THAT YOU GAVE IS HELPING TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES ACROSS
MORE FROM THE MASTER LATER
WHEN HE'LL BE SHARING LOTS OF GOOD NEWS ABOUT HOW YOUR DONATIONS HAVE CHANGED LIVES
NOT LEAST FOR THE ONE MILLION
THE MONEY WILL ALSO GO TOWARDS TRAINING PEOPLE TO HELP THEMSELVES
TOMATO AND BEANS FOR RED NOSE DAY
STOP RAVING INSANE AS IT MAY SEEM
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VILLAGE OF DBLE
LIKE EVERY YEAR
SOME OF THE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THEM
WILL BE LETTING US KNOW HOW YOUR MONEY HAS BEEN WORKING HARD RIGHT HERE IN THE UK
SO AS OUR DARLING BOYS FROM ONE DIRECTION ONCE SAID
IN CONTRAST TO THE THOUSANDS OF YOU WHO GOT UP OFF YOUR BACKSIDES AND MANAGED SOME TRULY GREAT
WHAT DO I DO BEST
AND THE ANSWER IS
MR DAVID BRENT SPEAKING FOR ALL OF US THERE
TWO MONTHS BEFORE
IT'S ABOUT THE MONEY IN YOUR POCKET
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH
THINGS REALLY ARE GETTING BETTER IN A HUGE WAY AND MAINLY OF COURSE BECAUSE OF THE THINGS AFRICANS
FUNNY AND QUITE FRANKLY A COMIC RELIEF LEGEND
IT'S A PICTURE OF CHANGE AND PROGRESS
YOU ARE PART OF THAT PICTURE
THE BIG FUTURE OF AFRICA IS CHANGING DAY BY DAY AND IT'S USUALLY FOR THE BETTER
ME AND A FEW OF THE BOYS
BUT YOU'RE ASKING ME FOR MONEY
BUT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE STAGGERING MILLIONS YOU RAISED THIS YEAR
AND THEN MY MOTHER DIED AND WE FOUND IT IN THE HOUSE
I THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT I I LIKE
SO THE BIG STUFF AND EVERYTHING ELSE GETS PICKED UP AND THROWN DOWN HERE BUT
IT'S CALLED THE FLEET AND TECHNICALLY
I HAD A QUICK CHAT WITH THE AUCTIONEER ABOUT ONE OF OUR ITEMS
WHAT I WOULD FEEL THE SAME
ESPECIALLY AT THIRTY TO FIFTY
WE'VE GOT DAPHNE'S LITTLE CLOCK
I THINK THAT'S A BARGAIN
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT CHRIS'S VIOLIN JUST ABOUT TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NOW
IF YOU SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT ON YOUR TRAVELS
BACKED THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME KIND OF ARMOURED VEHICLE THAT COULD BE DEVELOPED
GET THEM TO THE FRONT
THEY'VE BEEN SITTING IN THE CUPBOARD FOR A LONG TIME
CLIMATE CHANGE AND INVADING SPECIES ALL TAKING THEIR TOLL ON SOME OF OUR BEST LOVED CREATURES
ONE IS TO MONITOR THE GREYS AND THE REDS
IT'S THE FRUITION OF OF THE PROJECT
I'LL HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT IN JUST A FEW MINUTES BUT FIRST
THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING MOMENT IN CONTEMPORARY BRITISH BUTTERFLY HISTORY
THE CHILTENS IS A FAIRLY HEAVILY POPULATED AREA AND THE BIRDS ARE INTERACTING WITH BUSY ROADS AND
WE'VE RELEASED SIXTY BIRDS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY THEN WOULD HAVE EVER BELIEVED THAT
NEARLY TWO DECADES LATER
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AT WILDWOOD
DO WE HAVE A STORY OR TWO FOR YOU
LET'S FIND OUT IN THIS SPECIAL EPISODE OF THE ANTIQUES ROAD SHOW
AND IT'S A HARROWING EXPERIENCE
BECAUSE THERE IS RISK IN RESTORATION
AND POSSIBLY ONCE BELONGED TO A QUEEN OF ENGLAND
CAN THAT REALLY BE RIGHT
SO OFTEN WE FIND SURPRISING STORIES BEHIND THE OBJECTS WE SHOW
I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT WAS GOING TO COME OUT
AND WE KNEW THAT WE HAD THE CAMERA
THE ANTICIPATION IS IS ALMOST KILLING ME
I'VE KEPT QUIET ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS
I'M OBVIOUSLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SALE
EVEN I DON'T KNOW THE OUTCOME OF OUR FIRST STORY
REMEMBER THE VICAR'S VAN DYCK
FATHER JAMIE MCLEUD
WHO RUNS A RELIGIOUS RETREAT IN DERBYSHIRE
SENIOR CURATOR OF GLASS AND CERAMICS AT THE VICTORIAN ALBERT MUSEUM
WE KNOW EACH OTHER
AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF CENTRAL EUROPEAN GLASS IS WAY IN EXCESS OF MINE
SORT INVARIABLY DESCRIBED AS EITHER AN OIL LAMP
HOW GOOD DOES LIFE GET
IT'S JUST THE COMPLETE PACKAGE
THEY'RE DELIGHTED WHERE IT IS
THE WHOLE THING IS THE COMPLETE PACKAGE
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY PARALLEL OF THAT PERIOD IT
UM SO YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO MIX THEM TO MAKE IT PALATABLE
SOME OBJECTS ARRIVING AT A ROADSHOW DEFY EVEN OUR EXPERTS
WHICH WAS RECENTLY SOLD
A ROSE OUR GLASS EXPERT
AND THE OWNERS TURN UP BEARING THEIR STUFF
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE FIVE
HE WOULD HAVE GOT IT DOWN TO A FINE ART
WE SAW THAT REMARKABLE CHEST THAT WAS FIRST SEEN ON THE PROGRAMME IN SCOTLAND BY OUR FURNITURE
IT'S THOUGHT TO HAVE STARTED LIFE HERE
TO BE HERE TO MEET YOU BOTH
THE CHEST IS HERE
AND SHE'S WAITING FOR YOU ON THE KING'S STAIRCASE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WHEELED INTO THIS HOUSE SOMEWHERE
A LETTER TO BE SENT IN THE EVENT OF HIS DEATH AND ONLY THEN DID HIS TRUE CONTRIBUTION TO THE WAR
TEDDY'S PLANE WAS SHOT DOWN
YOU KNOW NOT KNOWING OR
IN THE MEANTIME
ON BEHALF OF ALL OUR TEAM
WHO I WOULD BE HAPPY TO IDENTIFY TO THE COURT
WHAT HAS BECOME OF MY BELOVED PEARL
WE STILL WANT TO BE INSPIRED
PART OF ITS FURTHER AWAY
EVERYBODY LOVES THE SPACESHIP IN ANYTHING SCI FI
WHAT IS NEW ABOUT THIS NEW GENERATION
WHAT IS NEW ABOUT THIS CHARACTER
WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY
I NOT ONLY ADMIT THEM
YOU CAN'T JOIN IN
BUT THE DOCTOR NATURALLY FEELS THAT YOU SHOULD
AND PEOPLE ALWAYS USED TO JOKE OH
FOR THE FIRST TIME REALLY
THAT NO MATTER HOW DREADFUL THE ALIENS WERE
CERTAINLY WHO I REMEMBER
WHO HAD A CAREER AND WHO HAD A REALLY
THEY ALWAYS SAY
GET AWAY FROM ME
QUITE COMFORTABLE REGENERATION
WHEN THEY GET TOGETHER
HE WAS REALLY UM PROPERLY FRIGHTENING ANOTHER WORLDLY
YOU KNOW VERY A VERY MODERN COMPANION
NONE OF THEM ARE ROMANTIC
ON NEW YEAR'S EVE
HELPING HIM CHOOSE THE TAR IS
I'M A STAUNCH TEETOTLER AND STRICTLY AGAINST DRINKING LEGAL OR ILLEGAL
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT YOUR HUNGARIAN GLUELASH
I CHOSE THE WORD ADVISEDLY
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN SO WELL BEHAVED THESE LAST FEW MONTHS
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GET OUT AS SOON AS WHAT I DO
I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH FOR THIS
SO PUT THE WORD OUT
COULD YOU DO ME A SMALL
WELL I MEAN A MAN WAKES UP IN THE MORNING
HE THINKS ABOUT HIS HORRIBLE BREAKFAST
CONTRARY TO POPULAR TRAVEL BROCHURE MYTH
HE'S SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE MACHINE SHOP
THIS IS HIS POINTLESS
I WAS IN A SUPERMARKET
TRYING TO STEAL A TIN OF PORT LUNCHEON MEAT
YOU'RE JUST ONE OF THOSE BLOKES WHO DOESN'T GET THE BREAKS
I'D LIKE IT TO GO NO FURTHER
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
BECAUSE I HAVE LIVED ABROAD AND
AH THE MONEY MOMENT
EACH TEAM HAS THREE HUNDRED POUNDS AND ONE HOUR TO BUY THREE BARGAINS WHICH WILL THEN BE
TODAY WE'VE GOT TWO TEAMS OF CHARS
AND I'M TRAINING
WE'RE SHOVING OFF TO THE SUNNY SURREY HILLS
EVER HEARD OF IT
TIN GLAZED EARTHENWARE
WE'LL CHECK OUT NOW
AH FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
AND THEY SELECT IT
ALMOST FROM EAST TO WEST
TO WI GREEN
WE SELL LOTS OF GARDEN ORNAMENTS
SOME TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER
AND YOU CAN GET TO BUILD UP A RELATIONSHIP OVER SEVERAL VISITS
FIND YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND EVEN GIVE HIM A NAME
THIS IS A STATUE OF GUY THE GORILLA
GUY GOT HIS NAME WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE ZOO ON GUY FAWKES DAY IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN
HE SET UP HIS STALL RIGHT HERE AT THE MAP IN PAVILION AWAY FROM THE CROWDS
WE'RE GOING TO PUT THOSE VALUES TO THE TEST RIGHT HERE
IT'S A BUSY OLD PLACE
THEY HAVE FIFTY TWO SALES A YEAR
BUT REALLY IT'S A PLAY ON INTERIOR DESIGN
AND I KNOW IT'S A VERY VERY BUSY DAY
I DID INHERIT IT FROM MY MOTHER
THE PRICE OF GOLD IS HIGH
I THOUGHT IT'D BE WORTH A BIT MORE
I WANTED A BIT MORE THAN THAT
I'M JOHN HUMPHRIES
AND WELCOME TO CELEBRITY MASTERMIND
THEY GET NINETY SECONDS FOR THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND TWO MINUTES FOR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
A LOT OF PEOPLE ENJOY IT
THEY ENJOY THE YEAH THE FOIBLES
MR KHAN FALLING DOWN A LOT OF YOUNG KIDS
THAT SORT OF THING
VERY DIFFERENT AND IT'S FUN TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND TO SAY
I GET NERVOUS EVERY TIME AND SOMETIMES
IF I'M NOT NERVOUS
UM IT'S AH IT'S AN AMAZING WORLD
IT'S A SOAP OPERA WEEK ON WEEK
BUT IT KEEPS EVERYONE ON THE EDGE OF THEIR SEATS AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ROUND THE WORLD
YOU COULDN'T DREAM OF DOING THAT YOURSELF IN A CAR
WHEN YOU GO AND WATCH THESE GUYS
AND THEY'RE RIGHT ON THE LIMIT GOING THROUGH CORNERS
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CELEBRITY TO APPEAR ON THE SHOW
AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO SO
AND THANKS FOR WATCHING
WELL IF THEY SHOW UP SO MUCH IN THE SHOP
WHEN I'M IN ACTION
BUT HE HAS A VERY SENSITIVE SKIN
I FOUND IT TOTALLY UNDRINKABLE
BUT THE TRICK WAS THEY HAD PUFF PASTRY
THEY THINK WE WAVE A FAIRY WAND
WE COULD ALL CLUB TOGETHER AND SEND EM MRS FOX
EXCEPT FOR THE POM POMS
WE HAVE A RATHER OLD BATH AT HOME
A BOTTLE OF WHISKY
CAN I SAY TWO SHILLINGS NOW
I'M INVITING EVERYBODY HERE TO BRING IN TWO THOUSAND AND WHATEVER IT IS
IF SHE CALLS IN
HE'S MY GRANDSON AND I LOVE HIM
YOU WANT A PROGRESSIVE SCHOOL
AND I'M TRYING TO SUPPORT HIM
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO DINO
THEY DON'T EAT MEAT
FOR SAFETY REASONS
NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY FOR THE PATIENTS
YOU DON'T KNOW THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY
AS SOON AS HE WASN'T LOOKING
EVERY CHANCE YOU GET
IT SETS DRUG STUFF
YOU ARE SO GORGEOUS
YOU'RE WHIING YOUR TIME
LET'S NOT GO DOWN THAT ROAD
WELL I DID RESCUE HER FROM THAT
NOW THE MONEY MOMENT
WHICH WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IN MANDARIN
I WOULD HOPE SO
WHICH IS A CHINESE ALLOY
LOOKS LIKE SILVER
AND YOU DON'T NEED TO POLISH IT
WOULD YOU TAKE FORTY POUND FOR IT
TURN IT BACK INTO SOME SORT OF MONEY
THE TEAMS WILL HAVE THE BONUS BUY TO CHOOSE FROM
THEY'RE QUITE CLOSE THROUGHOUT
WAS VERY GOOD ON THE GRINDER
BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE GIRLS
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE
LET'S HOPE IT MAKES SWEET MUSIC RIGHT NOW
WHAT WOULD WE LIKE TO SEE
BODYGUARD ON THE WAY HOME
THAT EAT AT HOME
MAYBE THEY'D MAKE ONE CURRY FOR THAT DAY
I BELIEVE IT WAS MADE BY A GERMAN PRISONER OF WAR
ONE THING I REGRET ABOUT THAT IS
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING RID OF IT
DO YOU LIKE TROIKA
WE'VE GOT TWO ITEMS
THE VICTORIAN SILVER CARD CASE
BELONGING TO SHEILA
THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE DAY
WELL OVER ITS ORIGINAL ESTIMATE
EXPERTS AND SCIENTISTS WE ARE GOING TO TRY AND EXPLAIN WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON
BUT IT'S ALSO A POWERFUL
THEY FACE REALLY DIFFERENT CHALLENGES
IT MEANS THAT THEY CAN SWIM FURTHER UP RIVERS AND COME INTO CONTACT WITH MORE PEOPLE
SO IF YOU'RE OVERSEAS YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK TWICE ABOUT TAKING A FRESHWATER DIP
BOATS HAVE UNWITTINGLY TRANSPORTED MANY SPECIES TO NEW TERRITORIES
WHERE THEY'VE WREAKED HAVOC WITH THE LOCAL WILDLIFE AND PERHAPS THE GREATEST CULPRITS OF ALL ARE
AND YOU FOLLOWED THE HUMANS
SOMEBODY FED YOU
UM WHERE THEY CAN HIT UP TOURISTS FOR FOOD AND LOOK SAD EYED AND
THEY CAN'T READ MAPS
EVEN IN THE HEART OF MOSCOW CITY
THEY REALLY ARE TOP DOGS
THEY ALSO GET SOCIAL CONTACT
SO I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD SEE THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOUR IN A CITY WHERE THERE AREN'T LARGE
THEY'RE SOFT BODIED ANIMALS
THE ONLY HARD BIT IN AN OCTOPUS ARE ITS MOUTH PARTS
SO IT ACTS AS A VERY EFFECTIVE DECOY AND IT MIGHT KEEP THE PREDATOR OCCUPIED
THEY END UP WITH TWO ROWS OF POISON ARROWS
THEN IT PROVES TO BE A TRULY UNSTOPPABLE FORCE
NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
ISSUES TO SAY
IT'S NICE TO BE WITH YOUR OWN SOMETIMES
IT WAS IT WAS AWFUL MOIST
IT WAS MY ANCESTORS WHO WERE HUNTING THEIR HEADS
THAT WAS SUCH A DISASTER
YOU'RE TOO BUSY CHATTING TO SOME WE GIRL A SANTA HAT
WE'LL GET HIM SOMETHING TO EAT
IT'S NEW YEAR'S EVE
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A KID MY MUM AND DAD DRAGGED ME ROUND THE ROMAN SITES
AND WHAT WE DO IS
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT POSSIBLY FIND
I'M ALSO PRETTY
THEY WIPED OUT ITS LEADERSHIP AND THEN THEY SET ABOUT THE LONG AND ARDUOUS TASK OF
BY ESTABLISHING SHIPPING LANES AND BUILDING ROADS
THEY'RE SHRINKING THEIR WORLD
AND BY CREATING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE
BY BUILDING PORTS
THERE THE TRIBES THAT THE ROMANS DISMISSED AS BARBARIANS WERE LESS INTERESTED IN TRADE AND
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE THEATRE
THEY HAD TO BE DESTROYED
ONE AFTER THE OTHER
PEOPLE SAW THE BENEFITS OF WORKING WITH THE ROMANS
YEAH THAT'S MORE THAN HALF OF ROME'S ANNUAL CONSUMPTION OF WHEAT COMING FROM THIS AREA
YOU'RE HERE ON THE GROUND
NO SATELLITE IMAGERY
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE AIR PHOTOGRAPHS
IN THE ROMAN PERIOD
HUNDRED SOLDIERS HERE
PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO COME THROUGH THE WALL
TRADE WAS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN
WHETHER YOU GO THROUGH ONE OF THE GATES OR EVEN MANAGE TO SNEAK OVER AT NIGHT
IT'S THE SAME THING WE USED IN ROMANIA
ROME OVERAWED PEOPLE
ROME IMPRESSED PEOPLE
EXPERTS AND SCIENTISTS
NATURE'S WEIRDEST PHENOMENA ARE NOW FREQUENTLY CAUGHT ON CAMERA
WHEREVER AND WHENEVER THEY OCCUR
THESE INCIDENTS CAN BE SO EXTRAORDINARY
THOUSAND WALKING CATFISH IN THEIR PLACE
SO THEY WILL FEED ON FISH
JUST LIKE ANIMALS
HE FOUND THAT HIS HONEY WAS BRIGHT RED
SUGARY SYRUP THAT'S JUST READY TO BE PICKED UP
I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY A GOOD IDEA TO TRY AN ODD COLOURED HONEY
A CARE FOR OTHERS
EXAMINATIONS OF THE BRAINS OF CERTAIN SPECIES OF WHALE AND DOLPHIN HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY HAVE THE
SO IT SEEMS THAT SCIENCE IS FINALLY CATCHING UP WITH ANCIENT HOW BELIEFS THAT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
EVEN PLASTIC MILK BOTTLES TIED TO THE BACK OF ELECTRIC TOY TRAINS
YOU CAN FIND SOME CAUSE FOR
BUT IN THIS CASE THEY HIT THAT BARRIER OF WARM AIR AND THEN ARE BENT BACK DOWN TO THE EARTH
I'VE GOT WARM YELLOW WATER IN THE BOTTOM BOTTLE HERE
JUST BY ABSORPTION IN THE AIR
SO ALL THEY'RE HEARING IS THE LOW FREQUENCY
THEY ARE THE EGG CAPSULES OF A MARINE SNAIL
IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE REGION
OTHERS REMAIN AN ENIGMA
YOU LUGGING IT ALL OVER HERE ON THE OFF CHANCE
YOU WANT TWO MINUTES
YOU'VE GOT TWO MINUTES
SHE WANTS TO BE YEAH
WE MET WHEN WE WERE AT CHURCH TOGETHER IN ADELAIDE IN AUSTRALIA
AT THE SAME TIME
WHICH IS GROWING VASTLY
SO I AND JUST WAITING ON THE NEXT TIM WANNACOTOGRAPHY
MUCH MORE TO COME
IT'S JUST THAT WHEN I WAS WORKING AS A MODEL
THEY OBVIOUSLY THRILLED TO BE ON THE SHOW
VERY GOOD ITEMS ON DINNER WITH MY HELP
I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST
IT'S NOT MY FAVOURITE THING BUT
WE WOULD DO WELL WITH IT
AND NINETY FIVE POUNDS WENT TO MARK STACEY
SUCH WAS THE PRESTIGE AND WEALTH OF THE FAMILY
THAT IT GUARANTEED A NEVER ENDING FLOW OF HIGH QUALITY WORKS OF ART
PAINTINGS AND FURNITURE TO THE HOUSE
UM I USED TO CYCLE QUITE A BIT
YOU'D WANT TO ADD A PERSONAL TOUCH OR TWO OF YOUR OWN
YOU BETTER NIP ALONG AND GOOD LUCK
SO I THINK I'VE GOT A FEW IDEAS BUT
I'M A BIT DISAPPOINTED BY THAT
YOU ARE PLUS FORTY
YOU DECIDE AFTER THE SALE OF YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS BUT
FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT DAVID'S LITTLE RABBIT
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT ALL THE SCORES
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE CREATING MY OWN SITCOM SO SOON IN MY COMEDY CAREER
THE FIRST VIDEO WE UPLOADED NOW HAS LIKE FOURTEEN MILLION HITS OR SOMETHING
WE WHEN WE WE GOT SIGNED TO A RECORD LABEL FROM BEING ON YOUTUBE
AND THE LABEL SAID TO US
I GOT BACKSTAGE
AND SO WE WAITED AROUND
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO APPEAR IN THE NEXT SERIES OF MASTERMIND ON BBC TWO
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A RACE AND IT'S A VERY
THE LIZARD POINT IN CORNWALL
VERY IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE IT'S TO SEE WHICH IS FASTEST
WE DROVE ACROSS SPAIN IN THREE BUDGET SUPERCARS
WHAT DO YOU COME UP WITH NEXT
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT
WE MUST NOW FIND OUT HOW FAST IT GOES AROUND OUR TRACK AND THAT
AND DON'T WORRY
IT IS IN FACT MOVE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
SO THAT'S WHERE YOU FIND HIM
I DID A COUPLE OF EMMATE MUSICALS AND
AND I WAS REALLY BAD
AND THEN IT GOES REALLY HIGH AND EVERY NIGHT
LIKE WHEN I GOT THE PART OF WOLVERINE
I WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT NO MATTER WHAT IT WAS
WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE
BECAUSE EVERYWHERE HE GOES
THEIR ATTENTION TO DETAIL
FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN
AND LOOK AT YOU
EVERYONE'S WALKING AROUND
THEY'RE NATURAL SPRINGS AND THEY'RE HOT
LIKE TO COOL MYSELF DOWN
BECAUSE I WAS HOPING FOR ANY EDGE
THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE TOWEL
THAT WE DON'T MAKE STUFF ANYMORE AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T MAKE VEHICLES
AND WE WERE WONDERING WHAT ELSE IS
HAVING ESTABLISHED WE DO MAKE QUITE A LOT OF STUFF IN BRITAIN
SO WE HATCHED AN AMBITIOUS PLAN
WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT LONDON WAS BUT
THAT WAS HALF THEIR AIR FORCE
SIX MONTHS LATER
AS CHURCHILL CONCEDED
THE WORST JOURNEY IN THE WORLD
BECAUSE IT WAS A CONVOY
CAPTAIN DP MOON
WE THOUGHT WE COULD GET THIS CONVOY THROUGH
THE BIG HEAVY HITTERS
THE MAIN DEFENCE FOR THE CONVOY
THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS WERE BEING BOMBED BACK AT HOME
HE'S A BARRISTER
NOT A TRAINED ARCTIC NAVAL WARFARE SPECIALIST
AND HE'S BEING CHASED
MOTHER WORLD'S BEST BATTLESHIP
AND IF THEY MANAGED TO GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE TUR
THAT'S NOT REALLY VERY SENSIBLE HERE
THEY CAN'T SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
THEIR JOB WAS DONE
SO THAT'S BRILLIANT AND CAN WE GO HOME NOW
PRESUMABLY THE INTENTION OF IT GETTING THERE
WHICH WILL LATER BE TAKEN TO AUCTION WHERE THEY'LL BE SOLD AND THE TEAM THAT WINS IS THE TEAM THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
GOOD LUCK WITH IT
LA THAT IS MINUS SEVENTY NINE
STIF BEARS AND KAISER
WE GET SAMPLES FROM TANKERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD AND WE TAKE THE SAMPLES AND WE HAVE TO DO
WHICH ARE ABOUT THIS BIG
BUT I'M GUESSING IT MIGHT NOT BE QUITE AS DESIRABLE AS THE BIZAR WEAR
IT'S JUST AS IT WAS MADE
MUCH LATER FRAME
NOW FOR THE BLUES
LOUISE AND BETSY
BUT WHICHEVER WAY IT GOES
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK
THIS IS FANTASTIC QUALITY
AND I THINK SHOULD GO EXTREMELY WELL
WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTEST
YOU ARE PLUS FORTY FIVE
YOU'RE OUT ON THE NET
IT'S BEEN A POPULAR HOLIDAY DESTINATION FOR WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS
ARE YOU AGREEABLE TO THAT
BUT WHAT IS SO INTRIGUING
WHICH WAS A COCKATOO
BUT I LIKE THAT
THAT'S A PROPER VALUATION
WE DIDN'T GET MIDDLE ESTIMATE
WE'RE STILL ON TRACK FOR YOUR FIVE TO SIX HUNDRED
WHEN THE MONEY COMES
THAT'S A LOVELY GESTURE
I WANT A NEW DRESS
PLEASE KEEP WATCHING
AND WELCOME TO CELEBRITY MASTERMIND
WITH FOUR CONTENDERS WHO THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA WHEN THEY AGREED TO DO IT
AH TOO LATE TO BACK OUT NOW
AH THE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE ROUND
IT WAS A VERY WEIRD
COUPLE OF MONTHS ACTUALLY
IT WAS VERY SURREAL
RECORDING WAS IN ITS INFANCY
FILMS WERE IN THEIR INFANCY
HE WAS VERY OFF THE WALL
THE THING IS THAT PEOPLE DO THINK ABOUT MUSIC HALL AND THEY SAY
IT WAS ALL VERY YOU KNOW MOTHER IN LAWS AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF
HE DID TRICKS WRONG
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO APPEAR IN THE NEXT SERIES ON BBC TWO THEN DO VISIT US ONLINE AT BBC
THANKS FOR WATCHING
DO JOIN US AGAIN FOR MORE CELEBRITY MASTERMIND
I GAVE THAT RING AWAY
I WANTED THAT MAN OUT OF OUR LIVES
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY
SHE WANTS TO BE THERE
AND YOU AND PHIL
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE
SHE'S HAD A FEW RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS
MAYBE NOT ABOUT KISSING DANNY
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
MEAN I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH YOUR SISTER BEING THE WAY SHE IS
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD PEOPLE SAY WHATEVER WEATHER THEY GET IN THE STATES
WE GET IT A FEW DAYS LATER
AND THAT HAS BEEN A REALLY BAD COMBINATION
EVEN A BIT OF SNOW ACROSS THE NORTH
COMING INTO SOUTHERN PARTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES LATER IN THE NIGHT
SEEING TEMPERATURES DROPPING CLOSE TO FREEZING
BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH OF COURSE TO TIP THINGS OVER ONCE AGAIN IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY
SO WE'LL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS
THE REMNANTS OF A STORM THAT'S BEEN BATTERING THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE USA
THE ATMOSPHERE DOESN'T LIKE TEMPERATURE CONTRASTS
TIDE STILL FAIRLY HIGH
THAT LOW GETS EVER CLOSER
NOT AS MUCH RAIN THIS TIME
AND PART OF THAT PROCESS IS WHAT GENERATES THE JET STREAM
ALL OVER THE WORLD
THE QUESTION IS FOR HOW LONG
WELL I TELL YOU WHAT
THAT WAS A TRAP
THE PATTERNS WENT A LITTLE BIT
IT'S COMPLETE AND
AND IT REALLY IS TOUCHING TO SEE THOMAS' INITIALS
REMEMBER THAT LOVELY DUTCH KNEEHO DESK
THAT WASN'T BAD
IT LOOKS VERY DRAMATIC IN THE MOVIES
MORE THAN I'D EXPECTED
FIRST ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND THEN THEIR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
OUR CELEBRITIES MIGHT WELL BE ASKING THEMSELVES
BUT ON THE STAGE
SO YOU READ A GOOD BOOK
AND THEN LIKE WHEN YOU READ IT THE SECOND TIME
YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING BEFORE
AND YOU'VE DONE A SHOW A HUNDRED TIMES
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAY NEXT
I WOULD NEVER HAVE WANTED TO CARRY ON IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME SORT OF BURNING DESIRE AND
WHEN THE RIGHT TIME FOR ATHLETES TO RETIRE IS
IF I ASK MYSELF THE SORT OF REALLY DEEP QUESTIONS
HAVING SAID THAT
I'M I'M QUITE FAMILY FRIENDLY
I'D LIKE TO BE MORE DANGEROUS
YOU LIKE OLDER
UM SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO APPEAR IN THE NEXT SERIES OF MASTERMIND ON BBC TWO
HE WAS REALLY UM PROPERLY FRIGHTENING ANOTHER WORLDLY
VERY A VERY MODERN COMPANION
BECAUSE SHE'S ANOTHER FEISTY
HELPING HIM CHOOSE THE TAR IS
SOME AMAZING RACES
SOME INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES
SOME BRILLIANT CARS
IT'S NOT AS LONG AS YOU THINK
IT TOOK TWO WEEKS
AND THIS IS AMAZING NEWS
TOP SPEED OF ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW IT ENDS
SOMEONE'S REALLY HOLDING ONTO ME TIGHT
IT WAS GOOD AH IT WAS GOOD I MANAGED TO GET YOU INTO THE RECOVERY POSITION
AFTER ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES
AND I DIDN'T REALISE HOW ANGRY HE WAS
NONE OF THE TRAIN COMPANIES WE CONTACTED WOULD PLAY BALL
BECAUSE THE VERY FIRST THING ANYONE IS GOING TO WANT TO DO UPON GETTING IN
EASE GET OUT OF IT
GET YOU A DRINK
WHAT DO LADIES GENERALLY DRINK
HAVE YOU EVER HAD A DRINK
I'LL MIND YOUR CLOTHES
I HAVE ACTUALLY BECOME THE MOST
THE THING TO DO IS TO TRY AND ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF OTHER PEOPLE
DID YOU GO AWAY FOR YOUR HOLIDAYS
WE WENT DOWN TO ITALY
TALKED TO THE POPE
REMEMBER THAT FELLOW I KNOCKED OVER WITH THE CAR
THINGS HAVE CHANGED
I'VE JOINED THEM
THEY'RE PROUD OF ME
MY TEENAGE SHOWED WERE GOING TO COME IN
THERE ARE SIGNS EVERYWHERE
I WOULD GIVE UP SMOKING AND THEN I THOUGHT THAT BECAUSE WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS
WHEN IT ACTUALLY COMES TO GIVING UP SMOKING
YOU'RE TWO PEOPLE
THAT'S WHEN I ENJOY SMOKING
YOU LIGHT SMOKING
BEING A SMOKER SINCE I WAS SO BIG
YOU PROBABLY ONLY NEED FIVE OR SIX
YOUR MAN'S BEHIND HIM AGAIN
I MADE A MISTAKE
FORGET ABOUT PEOPLE
WHAT IT IS BUT I'VE I'VE LOST ALL INTEREST
I'M SISTER BRIDGET
I TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD AND
DURING THE NIGHT
THAT'S THE END OF IT
YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT DEATH
OR ANYTHING TO DO WITH DEATH
THEY ARE THE MUSLIMS
THEY LIKE TO THINK THAT THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES
KILLERTON HOUSE IS BUILT IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE FOR ONE OF DEVON'S OLDEST FAMILIES
IT'S THE BUSIEST TIME OF YOU
WHICH NEEDS SOME RESTORATION
WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE A FLASHY WATCH OR PIECE OF JEWELLERY
IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE BIRD
DOLPHINS MAKE TWO TYPES OF SOUNDS
THEIR MOMENT COMES ALONG
A SINGLE TREE STANDING IN THE FOREST ISN'T ACTUALLY WORTH VERY MUCH
IT'S JUST AS VAST AND VALUABLE AS IT EVER WAS
BUT A WIDE VARIETY OF WILDLIFE HAVE QUITE HAPPILY TAKEN UP RESIDENCE HERE
IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO GET A COUNTRY FAR CALENDAR FOR ALL THOSE IMPORTANT DATES
IT'S NOT NOT KNOWING THE ANSWER
I'M JOHN HUMPHRIES AND WELCOME TO CELEBRITY MASTERMIN THIS
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE TEST OF WHAT THEY THINK THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY SHOULD KNOW AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DO KNOW
IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE SAME BY ANY MEANS BUT
IT'S A STRANGE THING TO DO
TO BE IN A SOAP OPERA LIKE THE ARCHERS FOR AS LONG AS I HAVE
MY WIFE'S IN THE ARCHERS AS WELL
IT HAS BEEN WONDERFUL BEING THE JR OF AMBRIDGE
I THINK IT'S AN ADVANTAGE TO LOOK YOUNGER THAN I AM
IT IS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR
BUT ON AN AWFUL LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL BECAUSE HE KIND OF BLAZED THE TRAIL
I COULD ONLY STAY TWO AND A HALF HOURS
BY THE ONES THAT CAME CENTURIES BEFORE ME YEAH
WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR IDEAS FROM
THEY ALWAYS WANT TO TELL YOU STUFF IF THEY KNOW YOU WRITE CRIME NOVELS
BUT THAT FIRST SENTENCE IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL
IT'S REALLY ABOUT
PEOPLE ASK YOU HOW YOU CREATE SUSPENSE
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ABOUT GIVING THE READER CHARACTERS THEY CARE ABOUT
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO APPEAR IN THE NEXT SERIES ON BBC TWO THEN DO PLEASE VISIT
DO JOIN US AGAIN FOR MORE CELEBRITY MASTERMINDS
THANKS FOR WATCHING
AND THEY BECAME GOOD FRIENDS
IN FACT BEFORE THE SECOND WORLD WAR
IF YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION
GINGERBREAD HAS A REALLY ANCIENT HISTORY
AND AND IT'S ACTUALLY MIDDLE EUROPEAN WORK
AND NO THEY WERE VERY SPECIAL YEARS
I'VE MADE A MISTAKE
IT'S VERY SPECIAL
I THINK EVERYBODY
YOU WORK AS A TEAM
THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU
IT'S REALLY SPECIAL AND I'M REALLY VERY
ESPECIALLY FOR THE SCHOOL
THEY'RE FULL OF INTEREST
WHO IS OUR CURRENT QUEEN'S GRANDMOTHER
AND THEY'RE RATHER MARVELOUS
FROM VICTORIAN VASES TO TAXIDERMY
EXPERTS AND SCIENTISTS
CAN ASTOUND US WITH INTRIGUING BEHAVIOUR AND EXTRAORDINARY DESIGNS
AND IN THESE WEIRD EVENTS
BUT AS THEY GET OLDER
EVEN THOUGH THEY'LL STIFFEN UP
THIS BEHAVIOUR WOULD BE TREACHEROUS
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM IN A DOMESTIC HERD
IT'S LAID DOWN IN ITS MUSCLES AND INTO A MEMBRANE THAT LIES BENEATH THE SHELL
WHEN THEY ARE ALL OVERLAID
BECAUSE THIS INITIAL SPLIT WILL DEFINE HOW EACH SIDE OF ITS BODY DEVELOPS AND
A UK FIRST AND EXPERTS THINK THAT THE ANIMAL IS ALREADY A FEW MONTHS
PERHAPS EVEN A YEAR OLD
AND I'M ABSOLUTELY ENTHRALLED BY THE THOUGHT THAT THIS SNAKE MIGHT STILL BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE
BELIEVE IT OR NOT
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED FAIRLY RECENTLY WHEN A GROUP OF HIKERS WERE OUT IN THE YORKSHIRE HILLS
THESE ANIMALS HAVE EXTRAORDINARY NAVIGATIONAL ABILITY
SO IF YOU TAKE THEM SIXTY
THINGS LIKE DUCKS THAT ARE SWIMMING OR FLOATING ON THE SURFACE
ACTUALLY HALF ITS HEAD IS GOING TO BE OUT OF THE WATER
BEFORE IT GETS CLOSE
IT MEASURED NEARLY THREE METERS IN LENGTH AND WEIGHED IN AT A STAGGERING
IF A LITTLE UNEXPECTEDLY
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
NOTABLY WHEN THE EGGS ARE JUST ABOUT TO HATCH
IF THEY FAIL THERE
IT COULD BE FATAL
SHRINKING YOURSELF AS A DEFENCE STRATEGY IS CERTAINLY PRETTY WEIRD BUT
BUT THEN AGAIN IT'S WORKING FOR THE MINIATURE CHAMELEONS OF MADAGASCAR
THE QUESTION IS THOUGH
BUT IT APPEARS THAT THERE MIGHT BE A LIMIT TO MINIATURISATION GOVERNED BY THE COMPLEXITY OF ONE
IT'S NOT THE HEART
IT'S NOT THE LUNGS
IT'S NOT THE LIVER
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT
AND WITH ITS BIZARRE ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR AND STRANGE NATURAL PHENOMENA
THERE'S NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT THE NATURAL WORLD STILL HAS THE POWER TO LEAVE US BOTH BAFFLED
AND WITH SO MUCH MORE TO DISCOVER
THE BIG QUESTION IS
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
PRETTY THINGS IN THE BARGAIN
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
SOUNDS LIKE A BIT OF A TALL TALE TO ME
WE'LL FIND OUT SHORTLY BUT RIGHT NOW
THE LITTLE PICTURE FRAME
WAS REALLY CUTE
THESE GUYS ARE ANIMAL LOVERS
THERE'S A TEASE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT
HAVE A NICE CUP OF TEA
WE HAVE A HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE ON THIS PROGRAM NO
I THINK THEY LIKE IT
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
RIGHT NOW FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
IT'S IN A TRADITIONAL STYLE
THERE IS A GOOD MARKET FOR ADVERTISING WHERE
START A TWENTY FIVE PANEL COMMISSION
IT'S THE TAKING PART
THAT'S WHAT I TELL MYSELF EVERY DAY
AND MARKET DAY IS EVERY MONDAY
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY
WE'VE GOT A BRIDGE HERE
AND I'VE GOT TO STRESS THAT
WE DON'T GET A LOT OF PURIST THINGS
I KNOW IT CAUGHT THE EYE OF OUR EXPERT
STRAIGHT IN AT TWO HUNDRED PO
I'M ONE OF THEM
ALMOST ALL OF US RELY ON THE CASING THAT THE MEAT COMES IN
THE PELT OF THE ANIMAL
SO I'VE COME TO ONE OF BRITAIN'S LAST REMAINING WORKING TANNERISTS TO FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW GOOD
AND NOW YOU'RE FLOGGING LEATHER ALL OVER THE WORLD
AND THEY GOT THEIR WAY
BUT THE PROBLEM WAS THE QUALITY CONTROL
WHAT IS CLAYTON'S LEATHER FAMOUS FOR
WE'RE BASICALLY BESPOKE LEATHER MAKERS
IF YOU'RE EVER WATCHING A GAME OF TEST CRICKET ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
NO ON THE CONTRARY
ERRING ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION
SO ALL CREDIT TO OUR EXPERTS
WE HAVE TO COOL THE RED HOT LIQUID INTO A SOLID
I PROMISED SHOWING YOU ELECTRICITY
THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO THAT
BECAUSE THEY ARE A FANTASTIC SET OF PEOPLE
THEY LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES
AND WHEN THE SNOW HITS
THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER SET OF CHALLENGES TO FACE
SALMON CAN BE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE UK
BUT A CLOSE RELATIVE
THE ARCTIC CHAR
IS ONE OF THE RAREST FISH IN BRITAIN
ALTHOUGH YOU MAY NOT THINK IT
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
ALMOST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO
OFTEN WITH A LOT MORE GRACE THAN US
EVEN IN THE WORST OF WEATHERS
JUST BRIM ASKING TO BE ADMIRED
THIS IS WHERE ALL OUR LOT WILL BE GOING UNDER THE HAMMER
IT'S WORTH ALL OF THAT
WE'VE GOT SIX BASIC ANIMALS UP FOR GRABS
I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON TEDDY BEARS
I KIND OF WENT WITH MY GUT FEELING ON THIS
SO THIS IS THE TYPE OF SOCIETY
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
NOT WANTING TO THROW THINGS AWAY
GOT ONE OF THE BEST ROCK N ROLL BANDS IN THE WORLD
THE ROLLING STONES
OUR SOCIAL HISTORY
I WAS VERY KEEN TO GET INVOLVED
NOT ONLY WAS HE BURIED IN A NORTH SOUTH DIRECTION
BUT THIS WAS IN HIS HAND
BECAUSE THE YEAR BEFORE IT WAS MINTED
THE EMPEROR CONSTANTINE HAD BEEN CONVERTED TO CHRISTIANITY
PAVING THE WAY FOR THIS TO BECOME THE OFFICIAL RELIGION OF THE EMPIRE
BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU STUCK A SPADE IN THE GROUND
I'M NOW RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT HUGE CEMETERY
BUT IT WOULD BE MORE COMMON IN PANNONIA
IT'S DIFFICULT TO BE SURE
BUT OUR FIGURES SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS UP TO THIRTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO WE SAMPLED WERE
A PLACE WHERE TRADERS
WHERE YOU HAVE THE HEAD IS NOT IN CORRECT ANATOMICAL POSITION
IN THIS INDIVIDUAL
I THINK THIS WAS PROBABLY HOW THEY DIED
SO WHAT HAPPENED
THERE IS THAT IMMEDIATE
WE HAD SOMEONE FROM A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING PLACE AND TIME
ONE THING I'M ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED ABOUT
WHEN YOU GET VALUES LIKE THAT
PERHAPS AN INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CULT OF BACCHUS
THAT'S A VERY INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY
WAS A NEWCOMER FROM ROME
WITHIN A FEW GENERATIONS
SIXTEEN HUNDRED YEARS LATER
OF COURSE IT CAN
BUT PEOPLE HERE KNOW IT'S A FALSE CHOICE BETWEEN IMMIGRATION GOOD
OR IMMIGRATION BAD
MIGRATION HAS BEEN TOO HIGH
AND SHOULD COME DOWN BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIGRATION AND THE
WHAT'S AT ROOT OF THAT PUBLIC ANXIETY IS A SINGLE DECISION TAKEN HERE AT WESTMINSTER WITH
SO WHY DID THEY TAKE IT
IT'S A REMARKABLE STORY
I THINK THAT'S A TRICKY QUESTION
UNLIKE THE GOVERNMENTS OF GERMANY
ONE REASON A MASSIVE MISCALCULATION ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD COME
THAT'S HOW IT IS
BITS OF HOW MANY WERE GOING TO COME AND THEY WERE IN THE LOW THOUSANDS
FOR THE CHOICE THEY MADE TO OPEN THE DOOR TO EAST EUROPEANS
THERE WAS ANOTHER PRIORITY
BUT THE WORST OFF IN SOCIETY NOTICED SOMETHING RATHER DIFFERENT
A BIG CHOICE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE POLITICIANS
BUT THEYD SCARCELY BOTHERED TO CONSULT THE PUBLIC
IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
TO PEOPLE WHO WERE WORRIED ABOUT ABOUT JOBS
WAGES OR WORRIED ABOUT THE PACE OF CHANGE
PEOPLE COMING HERE FROM THE EU
ANYONE CAN COME FROM ANY COUNTRY
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO VERY BIG NUMBERS
BUT THE THE IDEA THAT IT SHOULD COME DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED
MINISTERS END UP LOOKING FOR THINGS THEY CAN TARGET
AND THEY OFTEN COME WITH A CATCH
WE WERE ON THE SIDE OF THE ANGELS
UNIVERSITIES ARE SAYING
SO DAVID CAMERON CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF SOMETHING MORE CONCRETE
AS IT TURNS OUT
QUESTIONS ON IMMIGRATION AND GETTING CHEFS WITH THE NECESSARY EXPERIENCE
YOU MAY HAVE A CUT IN YOUR WAGES YOU MAY EVEN LOSE YOUR JOB
JUST AS WE SAID TO THE COAL MINERS THIRTY YEARS AGO
FEW WOULD NOW DEFEND THE HUGE INCREASE IN NUMBERS
LET ME PROMISE YOU THIS WE WILL WORK THROUGH THIS TOGETHER
WHICH IS TO ALLOW MIGRANTS IN
ALL RIGHT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT TO TELL ME OPEN THE BORDERS
AND I WOULD SAY WHAT I WANT FOR YOU
YOUR CHILD IS FOR YOUR CHILD TO HAVE A VERY PROSPEROUS AND GOOD
YET THAT IDEA IS NOW COMING UNDER ATTACK
NOT JUST IN WESTMINSTER
BUT IN THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE
THERE IS A MIGHTY STRUGGLE ENSUING ABOUT WHICH APPROACH IS RIGHT FOR
QUALITY OF LIFE
LACK OF SOCIAL HOUSING
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WHEN YOU SENT ME AWAY BEFORE
WE WANTED TO GIVE HIM A GOOD SEND OFF
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
AND THIS ISN'T ABOUT THAT
BLOW HIM TO PIECES
BUT NOT FOR HUNTING
WHEN YOU HEAT THE ELEMENTS
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH GRAVITATIONAL ENERGY TO COMPRESS THE CORE ANY FURTHER AND
AND A FRACTION OF HIS BRIGHTNESS
NEAR A BLACK HOLE
QUITE UNPLEASANT THAT TIME
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU
I'D SAY FIFTY TO EIGHTY
WE'RE PINNING ALL OUR HOPES ON THE MAN WITH THE GAVEL
WHICH IS SLIGHTLY EARLIER
WE'LL TAKE THAT
NICK THINKS IT'S SCOTTISH
GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND
THAT WOULD CREATE THE FLANGE WHEN THE TWO
WHEN I BUY BROOCHES FOR MY OTHER HALF
IMPORTANT BUSINESS NEWS
JEREMY WOULD BE SLOWER AND WE WOULD BE FASTER
IT WOULD SEEM DELIBERATELY
IF YOU ARE A YOLBO AND YOU HAVE A SUGGESTION
WRITE IT DOWN ON A NOTE
EVEN THOUGH IT'S A BIT BORING
ALL THE WAY THROUGH MY LIFE
IT'S GOT PLASMA THIS AND ST LIKE THAT
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
SO EVERYTHING WAS CARBON FIBER
BUT WE SHALL FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS LATER ON
MY GUEST TONIGHT DRIVES A BENTLEY CONTINENTAL AND A RANGE ROVER
AND HAS AN IMPENETRABLE ACCENT
THE FIRST QUESTION WAS
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
BE VERY LUCKY WITH IT
MOST OF THEM UNDERSTAND
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PETROLHEADS I THINK WE'VE EVER HAD ON THE SHOW
EVER SINCE I PASSED MYVAN TEST
MAY THE BEST MAN WIN
IT'S TIME TO END
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING
I THINK IT'S EMBARRASSING
HE'S BEEN INJURED RECENTLY AS WELL
LET ME GET THIS RIGHT
THE HOME OFFICE CANCELLED HIS APPLICATION TO GO BACK
SO WHAT THAT NOW MEANS IS HE HAD A PROVISIONAL FLIGHT BOOKED
THEN WE'LL CLOSE WITH SOME DIGNITY AND
YEAH I'M REALLY PISSED OFF
BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY GOT THE HOOK AND THE LOOK
I'VE BEEN HERE ONCE BEFORE IN THE SPRING
AND EVEN THEN WHEN THE WEATHER WAS BETTER
NO MATTER HOW TREACHEROUS
VERY LOCAL WHERE WE ARE TODAY
IN ORDER TO MAKE A LIVING
BUT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD
ON THE ARCTIC SEA
AND THEYRE THEY ARE VERY UNPREDICTABLE
SOME DAYS THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THEM
AND THEN EVENTUALLY WE GOT AS MANY AS SIXTY FIVE PAIRS
AND NOT JUST HERE
WINTER MAY BATTER THE MOST EXPOSED AREAS HERE BUT
IT'S KNOWN AS ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST WELCOMING TOWNS
WE'VE GOT A MASSIVEQUEUE
THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO
ADAM'S GOT THEM IN HIS BEDROOM
THEY BELONG TO VICTORIA
TO REALISE I WAS WRONG
AND OUT OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MEN
THIS GIRL CAN'T RESIST A HAT
WE HAVE TO BUY IT
AND WHEN HE WAS APPOINTED AS A MILITARY GOVERNOR GENERAL
HERE'S A BIT OF A CHALLENGE
THERE WASN'T THE EXCITEMENT TO BE FOUND ON THE DAY
COMES FROM NOTTINGHAM
AND WE ALL KNOW WHY NOTTINGHAM'S SO FAMOUS
LATER ON IN THE SHOW
IT'S A GOOD ONE
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU WANT FROM A TEAPOT
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT JUST A DRUNKEN BRICKLA MEAN
CHARLOTTE RE STUDIO POTTERY
AND I DON'T REALLY LIKE IT
THE JAPANESE TOY BROUGHT IN BY KAREN
SOME GREAT RESULTS SO FAR
ONE OF HOLLYWOOD'S HIGHEST PAID STARS SPENT SOME OF HIS CHILDHOOD IN A WORKHOUSE
A VERY FAMOUS CHARACTER
WHAT WAS THE DISCIPLINE LIKE IN HERE
I THOUGHT I'D LIKE A HOLIDAY
AND SHE CAME BACK ABOUT A YEAR LATER
IT WAS REALLY NICE TO SEE THAT BIG SMILE ON MARK'S FACE WHEN THOSE CORKY TOYS RACED OUT OF THE
MAYBE YOU SHOULD COME AND SIT DOWN
SHE WILL COME ROUND
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO TURN THINGS AROUND
SHE COMES OUT FIGHTING
NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE
CAN YOU ALL JUST BACK OFF
HE'S WORKING IN THE PUB
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET OUT THERE AND TAKE A CHANCE
AS YOU KEEP SAYING
I'M GOING TO BE THE ONE TO GET THE FLAK THIS TIME
I'M ASKING YOU TO DO THIS FOR ME
IT MAY LOOK SUPERFICIALLY LIKE A MOS IN FACT
ITS COMMON NAME IS CLUBMOSS
IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT
BY VIRTUE OF THOSE TOUGH
BUT THERE WAS THEN
EACH OF WHICH REPRESENT
AND ONE IN WHICH THE INSECTS WERE TO PLAY A CRUCIAL PART
TOGETHER REALLY GREY
IT'S A LOT OF WORK
WHAT MORE WHAT MORE CAN YOU GIVE
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO GET COOKING
THANKS TO ALL OUR CHEFS AND DO JOIN ME FOR MORE REMARKABLE RECIPES NEXT TIME
YOU PROBABLY CONJURE UP IMAGES OF GALLERIES IN LONDON AND PARIS AND NEW YORK
BUT IF YOU LIVE IN SOUTH WALES
LET'S BE HONEST
THIS IS A MA
START ME STRAIGHT IN AT
IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY
DON'T PAY THAT MUCH
ONCE YOU'RE INSIDE
WHERE DO YOU START I MEAN
ST ANDREW'S ROKER IS ONE OF THEM
I MEAN IT IS SUCH A LONG WAY AWAY FROM ITS HOME IN THE COTS WORLDS ISN'T
THIS WAS AFTER A PERIOD OF RAPID SUBURBAN EXPANSION IN SUNDERLAND
NORTH OF THE RIVER
OBVIOUSLY LOVED THE ARTS AND CRAFTS MOVEMENT AND
IS THAT THE TRUE REFLECTION
IT'S GOT THE LOOK
WE'VE GOT A VALUE OF ONE EIGHTY TO TWO FIFTY
WHY WE REVIEW FAST VOXELS SO RARELY ON TOP GEAR
RATHER THAN A LEVER
IF I WERE TO CHOOSE ONE OF THESE THREE CARS TO DRIVE HOME IN TONIGHT
THIS IS THE FUTURE
BUT NOW WE MUST RETURN TO THE PRESENT
BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION
THE FASTEST STAR WE'VE EVER HAD IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR
BUT WE DECIDED TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION ON THIS OCCASION BECAUSE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
THEY REALLY STRUGGLED THE LAST FEW YEARS
AND THEN NOTHING HAPPENED
WED TELL HIM TO GET LOST
AND WHO WOULD THEREFORE HAVE TO GO INTO MEXICO AND TEST THE MASTRETTA WAS THE MAN WHO MADE
AND COMING UP NOW IS THE MOST THOROUGH TEST OF THEM ALL
YEAH AND I'VE GOT A QUESTION STRAIGHTAWAY
WHY DOES HE DO THAT
PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY
OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN
IT IS TIME TO END
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
YOU HAVE TO BE LED BY YOUR PROFESSIONALISM
HOW WILL I
WHEN YOUR FRIEND COMES BACK
LAY PRETTY BIG LATHE
WE'D NEED A JOKE
SO THAT'S ALL RIGHT
AND RAN OFF WITH HER
ACCORDING TO THE AUCTIONERS ESTIMATE
FIFTY POUNDS THAT'S MINUS FIVE
WASN'T QUICK ENOUGH THEN
HIS IDENTITY WAS NEVER DISCOVERED
HIS MOTHER THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA
IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT PLANNING RULES WERE MUCH LOOSER
WHAT YOU CAN OR CAN'T BUILD IN THE COUNTRYSIDE IS A CONSTANT SOURCE OF CONTROVERSY
HAVE NEW PLANNING RULES HELPED TO SAFEGUARD OUR RURAL LANDSCAPE
STANTON ENGINEERING WAS BROWNFIELD AND
WE ACCEPT THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR HOUSING IN THE VILLAGE
THE PARISH COUNCIL SAID YES TO THAT
THE SCHOOL IS ALREADY FULL
THERE'S THINGS LIKE WATER PRESSURE
THOUSAND PAGES OF PLANNING GUIDANCE
BUT WE WOULD LIKE TEN
MAINLY ON THE BASIS
BECAUSE MANY OF THE THINGS THAT CAUSE DELAYS ARE BEYOND THEIR CONTROL
YOU HAVE TO CONSULT WITH LOCAL PEOPLE
YOU HAVE TO AMASS ALL OF THE EVIDENCE AND YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY LET DEVELOPMENT
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN TAKE PLACE IN A MATTER OF WEEKS
BUT THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE IS MUCH FASTER IN THE LAST THREE YEARS THAN UNDER ANY OTHER
SO I THINK IT IS WORKING BUT IT'S JUST TAKING SOME TIME
YOU ACHIEVE IT BY HAVING A LOCAL PLAN AND A HUGE NUMBER OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE DONE IT
AND IT WAS THEIR INFECTIOUS ENTHUSIASM
THESE PLACES ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT
THEY NEED TO BE KEPT OPEN
AS THE GOVERNMENT PREPARED TO UNVEIL ITS NEW PLANNING GUIDELINES
WE ARE VISITING UPON THE NEXT GENERATION THE REAL PROSPECT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO GET A HOME
THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO BUILD OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND
THAT'S OVER A MILLION PLOTS OF LAND
AND NOW WHILST WE DISPUTE THAT NUMBER
THE BBC MAKE AN AWARD TO A FARMER FOR THEIR STANDOUT CONTRIBUTION TO FARMING AT ITS FOOD AND
AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR SUGGESTIONS
IF YOU KNOW A FARMER WHO DESERVES RECOGNITION FOR MAKING A REAL DIFFERENCE TO THE FUTURE OF FARMING
AND FOR INSPIRING THE REST OF US
THEN YOU CAN NOMINATE THEM AS OUTSTANDING FARMER OF THE YEAR
DETAILS ON HOW TO DO THAT ARE ON OUR WEBSITE
THE VALUE OF WOOL IS NOTHING LIKE IT WAS BACK THEN
HE'S MARKED HER WITH A GREEN MARK
WE THEN CHANGE TO BLUE AND THEN RED AND THEN BLACK
I'M OFFICIALLY THE PERSON WHO ISN'T SCARED OF ANYTHING AND DOES MAD THINGS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND
UM JUST BEFORE WE GO
BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW WHERE YOU'D LIKE COUNTRYFILE TO GO TO IN THE BRITISH ISLES
IN THE YEAR AHEAD
BRAVE CONTENDERS MAY THINK THEY'VE DONE PRETTY WELL WITH THEIR CAREERS SO FAR BUT WHAT THEY HAVEN'T
STOPPED IT THERE
I GO AND SEE HIM NOW
THERE'S NOTHING THAT HAVEN'T BEEN CALLED
I WAS A TRAUMAMAN FOR EIGHT DAYS
SO THOROUGHLY MEMORABLE EIGHT DAYS
I WORKED AS A CORNISH FISHERMAN FOR EIGHT MONTHS
WHEN IT'S ROUGH
THE PARISH OF FINDON IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE
COMING UP TO EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND A BIT BEYOND
SHE'S ANGRY WITH HER FAMILY
SO I THINK SHE'S SHE'S WELL AWARE THAT THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT PLACE FOR HER TO BE
WELL I WAS ON PATROL IN AFGHANISTAN
IT HAS MORE COLOURS ON IT
AND MY GREAT GRANDPARENTS WERE BORN IN LUDHAM
BECAUSE I REALLY GENUINELY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE
MAYBE THAT WAS THE IDEA
YOU PUT THIS ON THE TABLE
BUT OTHER THAN THAT
WITH THAT KIND OF BALANCE
IN AROUND ABOUT THE YEAR NINETEEN TEN
THE ACTUAL TITLE SUGGESTS A KIND OF HUMAN ELEMENT
AND I MEAN BEING QUITE A DOG PERSON MYSELF
ITSELF DO YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WAS RELATED
THE ANTIQUES ROAD SHOW
BUT IT'S THE NOISE
AND I HAVEN'T TRIED THIS BEFORE
WHAT THE STORY WAS LIKE
GIVING METALS TO ANIMALS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND THEN HE STILL COULDN'T GET THE FIRE TO DRAW
WHO WAS ALSO A VERY FAMOUS
WHERE DOES IT LIVE AT THE MOMENT
AND I'M BASING THE VALUE THAT I'VE PUT ON THIS
AND SUCH AN ICONIC PIECE AS WELL
UNTIL NEXT TIME
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS
AND THE KEY HAS BEEN NEW SCIENCE
THE SMALLEST BIT OF EVIDENCE
LOOKING AT THE SNAILS FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT POINTS ON THERE
WE CAN ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THEM TO SPECIES
BUT IF YOU CAN REFINE IT WITH THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INFORMATION
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHAT WE HOPED FOR IN HERE WERE REMAINS THAT HAD BEEN HIDDEN AWAY BURIED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
WE KNEW THAT THE SKELETONS WERE INCOMPLETE BUT NOW WE KNEW THAT EITHER SOME BONES HAD BEEN TAKEN
NOT ONLY FROM PLACE TO PLACE
THINGS CHANGED QUITE RADICALLY
IS THIS WHAT I THINK IT IS
TWELVE INCHES OF WATER AND THE WATER WAS MURKY
BUT IT WAS WHITE
THEY'RE BLACK IN COLOUR
PUSHED THE WIRE IN IT WAS SIX FOOT WIDE
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE LIVES AND BELIEFS OF SUCH A REMOTE TIME
BUT WHEN THE RESULTS DO COME
WE KNOW THAT IT WAS A PARTY OF SIX
YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE UPSIDE DOWN
ON THE HILL THAT NIGHT
THE OPTION IN MY HEAD WAS THEY'VE EITHER MANAGED TO STAY TOGETHER AS A GROUP OR WE'RE GOING TO BE
AND IF IT WAS A AH IT WAS A LONG DAY AND HIS FEET WERE HURTING
HOW ABOUT SAYING
WHAT DID YOU EVER KNOW ABOUT THOMAS SIDNEY COOPER
WE OF ONE MIND HERE
WHY DON'T WE FIND OUT OVER AT THE AUCTION JUST HOW BULL
WITH OUR OLD FRIEND
IN CASE THEY DON'T
THINGS REALLY HEATED UP FOR MY FAMILY WHEN IT TURNED OUT WE WERE GOING TO BE RECEIVING A VERY
BUT WHAT IF YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T LIKE YOUR THING
LIKE AN OLD TISSUE
YOU NEED TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION
HE'LL LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE CUDDLY AND FUNNY
WE ALL KNOW WHAT JOBS WE HAVE TO DO
AND I KNOW THAT
EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE A PRINCE
I JUST WANTED TO BE TREATED THE SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE
AND WE LET JACK DO THE SPEECH
HE KEPT GOING ON ABOUT JACK'S FIGHTING SPIRIT AND STRONG
WHICH MADE MAMMA A BIT MISERABLE
AND SLIGHTLY CONFUSED
WHAT'S UP WITH THE INTERNET
FIVE SQUARES OF TOILET PAPER PER VISIT
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY SUGGESTING WE CUT YOUR FATHER'S HEAD OFF
BELLE PROMISES TO DO A FULL HOUSE HOOVER ON A BI WEEKLY BASIS
SORTED ITSELF OUT IN THE END
AND WHERE WAS MUGGINS WHEN THIS WAS DISCUSSED
HOT TOPIC WHERE SHALL WE GO ON OUR HOLIDAYS
YOU MIGHT THINK
THIS SHOULD BE A TREAT
SHE'S BEEN A LITTLE QUIET
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SHARINGING YOUR THOUGHTS
I HAVE DECIDED THAT THIS HOLIDAY DECISION IS TOO IMPORTANT FOR ONLY ONE OF US TO WIN
AND WHAT'S MORE
STANDING STRONG ON THE HIGH SEAS
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CHECK ALL THE FACTS
WHAT DAD HAS BROKEN TWO LEGS
EVERYONE IS SO PLEASED THEY PICKED MY IDEA
YOUR HEART POUNDING
MUCH LOVE AND KISSES
AND JUST LIKE WHEN THAT JEEP BOUNCED OVER THE SAVANNA
YOU'VE NEVER FELT MORE ALIVE THAN NOW
THE HOLESS SON
SCRATCHINGS IN THE NIGHT
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING LIVING IN THERE
AND JUST WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING WITH THAT FLAME THROUGH
AND IT TOTALLY STINKS
WE WORSE THAN THAT
AND MUM AND DAD
WHAT CAN THE MATTER BE
I NEED A SHOWER
VICTORY IS MINE
I DON'T LIKE TO COMPLAIN
I DO LIKE TO COMPLAIN
AND IF NECESSARY
I'LL TAKE ACTION TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING
THE NEIGHBOURS ARE ALLOWED TO BE ANNOYED
SHE COULD GO THERE DURING THE WEEK
SHE THINKS SHE'S SO BRILLIANT
REMEMBER WHEN HE SAID YOU'D GET YOUR NEW LAPTOP
THAT LAST NOTE WAS MEANT FOR YOUR SISTER
THIS BE WHAT'S CALLED AN EXTENDED METAPHOR
AND COCONUT WATER ON TAP
BUT MAYBE IT'S JUST WHAT MUM AND DAD NEED RIGHT NOW
TO GET PDENCE TOGETHER
IGNORE THE REST
WITH REGARDS TO THE INCIDENT WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE SPARKED THIS UNFORTUNATE EPISODE
RATHER THAN SHOP NOW
WE'LL GO FOR IT
EVERY YEAR THEY HAD AN EXHIBITION
WHAT MAY WE SAY
I'M SETTING UP A CHARITY
SOMETHING IS DISTURBED BY CROSSRAIL
I HAVE A DREAM OF HAVING MY OWN ORPHANAGE
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD SAY TO NICK
WE COULD DO THAT
WE AGREE ON THIS
BUT IF WE WERE TO BUY THAT AND
I THINK IT COULD BRING AS MUCH AS SEVENTY FIVE
SO YOU CAN GET IN AND REFILL IT
IT NEEDS TO RIPEN
ALL OF OUR CONTENDERS ARE
SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT
WHICH IS NOT VERY APPEALING TO ANYBODY
BECAUSE I THINK GENERALLY
BECAUSE I'M I'M MORE OF A LIVE ARTIST THAN I AM A STUDIO ARTIST AND
AND IT KIND OF BRIDGED THE GAP
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
I THOUGHT SHE DID PILLOW TALK
SHE WAS THIS AMAZING
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO APPEAR IN THE NEXT SERIES ON BBC TWO
FOLLOWED BY TWO AND A HALF MINUTES OF GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
WE HAVE TO HAVE A TIE BREAK
AND THE SIX HIGHEST SCORING RUNNERS UP IN THIS ROUND WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO CLAIM A PLACE IN THE SEMI
STILL PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
THANKS FOR WATCHING
ITS THE CLOSEST THING TO A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP I'VE EVER HAD
WE WERE TOGETHER BEFORE
HE'S NOT DENNY'S DAD
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
LESS PLACES TO HIDE
I'M THINKING MORE
AND I WANT CAROL WITH ME TODAY
AND SHE ALSO USED TO SAY
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG
THEY SAID A SOLDIER HAD BEEN KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN
AND WE'RE GOING SHOPPING LATER
THAT WAS FOUR BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE
WELCOME TO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY
WE'VE GOT A PAIR OF LIGHTLY LOOKING EXPERTS
WE'RE IN THE HISTORIC TOWN OF DERBY
THIS WAS ONCE A ROMAN TOWN
AND THEN LATER IT BECAME A MAJOR VIKING AND SAXON SETTLEMENT
THE GRAND HALL IN DERBY'S ASSEMBLY ROOMS
AND I'VE ALREADY FOUND SOME WONDERFUL ITEMS
WHEN I WAS IN NEPAL
SO WE GOT OUR HOME BUILT
HI WHAT'S YOUR NAME
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING IN JUST
I KNOW YOU'VE OUTGROWN THE HOUSE NOW
LET'S HOPE THAT LITTLE BLACK POT WITH A YELLOW LID IS AROUND FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS
RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME TO JOIN UP WITH OUR EXPERTS BACK AT THE VALUATION DAY
JUST FIFTEEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE AGED OVER SEVENTY HAD A DRIVING LICENSE
IT'S MORE THAN SIXTY
AND THAT MEANS THE ROADS ARE FULL OF PEOPLE WHOSE EYES ARE BROKEN AND WHOSE
WITH THAT IN MIND
IT'S QUITE PLUSH
WITHOUT JAMES HERE
IS OUR TRANSPORT SECRETARY IN GREAT BRITAIN DOESN'T KNOW WHAT A MOTORWAY IS
PO NINETY NINE NOTE TO MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR SHOPKEEPERS
AH SO LET'S JUST FIND OUT
SOMETIMES YOU GET A QUIRKY
OFFBEAT FOREIGN LANGUAGE PRODUCTION
THAT'D BE A SAAB
AND THEN OCCASIONALLY
I'M TRYING TO GET OFF GIVE ME A BREAK
SO THE LIGHTS GO GREEN AND I WAS SO UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE THAT I REVVED OFF TOO QUICKLY AND
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'D CALL IT
BUT WE GOT INTO OUR DIRECTOR'S GOLF BUGGY ONE DAY
THEN THE DRIVER'S SEAT THERE
JEREMY AND I DECIDED TO MAKE A CAR SPECIFICALLY FOR OLD PEOPLE
CAN I ASK A QUESTION
AND NOT JUST FOR THE ELDERLY
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED
ON TOP OF OUR CAR WAS A BOX
PART ONE IS ON NEXT SUNDAY
THE WEEK AFTER THAT
AH THERE'S NO KIDNEY
NOTHING WAS OUT OF PLACE
THE MINUTE CAROL COMES IN
LET'S HOPE THAT OUR TEAMS' PURCHASES TODAY DON'T COST US AN ARM AND A LEG
LOVELY TO BE HERE
FIRST UP FOR THE RED TEAM
I WAS A BIT MORE FRUGAL THAN NORMAL
OR SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO SAY
WE MAY HAVE A FALSE SPRING HERE
IT'S A REALLY NICE
BUT FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME
WHICH IS BRILLIANT
BIDDING IN THE ROOM THEN AT FORTY FIVE
THAT IS BAD LUCK
I THINK THAT'S SHAMEFUL
HE COMMISSIONED THE ARCHITECT JOHN NASH TO DESIGN HIM THIS SPECTACULAR PICTURE GALLERY
THINGS ARE GETTING TIGHT
BUT IT'S VERY INTERESTING
GOT A FAMILY DECISION
THE WAVE BREAKS
PROBABLY AROUND FIVE
MAYBE USE IT AGAIN FOR DRESSING UP YEAH LET THE GRANDKIDS USE IT NEXT TIME
WE SHOULD BE AFTER THIS LOT
SOME THINK THAT MAY BE THE OLDEST ITEM HERE OR THE LARGEST OR THE HEAVIEST
I DO APPRECIATE IT
THIS IS SUCH A REMARKABLE PIECE OF FORCE
THEY'RE RIGHT NEXT TO US
NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN THE BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE
IT'S A LOT COLDER
RECLAIMING ITS SHORELINE
ONE MIGHT BECOME AN ADULT AND ONE MIGHT
BUT IT'S ALSO SURPRISINGLY MILD
I'M GETTING A READING OF NINE DEGREES
SO THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY GOOD
IF THERE'D BEEN ANOTHER THOUSAND MILES
THE SHORTEST DAY
THAT'S NOT THE CASE BECAUSE THERE'S A LAG
SO THE COLDEST MONTHS ARE ACTUALLY JANUARY
PRETTY MUCH FRESH OUT THE GROUND
AND THE COLDER IT IS
THE QUICKER I CAN DO IT
SO THE QUICKER I CAN MAKE WORK
SO THE COLDER IT IS
BECAUSE OF ONE SIMPLE THING
BUT UNLIKE MOST FAMILIES
HE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE PICTURE
AND TO GET TO GRIPS WITH AN ENTIRE ANCIENT CIVILIZATION
READY TO BE SMITED
BEATEN WITH STICKS
FEATURES ARE INHERITED
THE FUNCTION IS VERY EGYPTIAN
ALTHOUGH THE VICTORIANS WERE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE BIBLE LANDS
FOR THE FIRST TIME
HE HAD A PERMANENT BASE
THOUSAND OBJECTS THAT WERE DISCOVERED BY PETRIE
WHERE YOU PUT ALL OF THOSE SEPARATE TYPES OF POTTERY CHANGING OVER TIME IN COLUMNS
WE HAVE THE COMPUTER
PEOPLE WHO CRAVED UNWHOLESOME EXCITEMENT AND PEOPLE WHO WASTED TIME WATCHING SPORT
EVERYBODY GOT ON VERY WELL
WAS THAT IT WOULD BE BEST IF WE CHOSE A CAR WITH FOUR WHEEL DRIVE
WHY DOES EVERYWHERE
ALL OVER THE WORLD
THAT SUGAR WAS PRODUCED ON LARGE PLANTATIONS AND THOSE PLANTATIONS EMPLOYED THE
THE VICTORIES OF THE NAPOLEONIC WARS AT THE NILE
AND HE HAD HIS FIRST COMMANDS IN THE WEST INDIES
HE COMMANDED TWO FRIGATES AND A BRIGUR IN THE AMERICAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE IN THE WEST INDIES
AND WE KNOW FROM ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXCAVATION OVER WHERE THE SHIPS WERE AT ANCHOR THAT THE SEABED IS
WHERE THE HEAT FROM THE TROPICS TURNS THE FRESH FOOD RANCID AND THE WATER GREEN WITH
PERHAPS WITH A TINY COPPER THIMBLE
AND AS ALWAYS WITH ARCHAEOLOGY
AND IT'S ONLY THE SECOND TRENCH THAT WE'VE DONE
HISTORIANS WRITE ABOUT PLANTATIONS AND PLANTATION LIFE
WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO LOOK AT NOT JUST THE PLANTATION AS A SYSTEM
WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THAT LEAD INSIDE THE BONE
AND IF IT'S BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE BONE
AND SCURVY WASN'T A PROBLEM FOR HIM BECAUSE BEING ONE OF THE DOUBT
THESE SORTS OF THINGS
WHICH BECAME MUCH MORE PROBLEMATIC WHEN YOU WERE ON DEEP SEA JOURNEYS
SO THE SCURVY PROBLEM WASN'T SUCH A GREAT ONE
SHIP'S COMPANY VERY SICKLY
ON THE SAME DAY
IT WAS AN ACT OF SUICIDE
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY LOST
SO NEL KNOW KNEW HER FOR
WE WERE GOING ROUND AND ROUND ON THE SPEED BOWL AND THEN THE DRIVER JUST TOOK HIS HANDS OFF THE WHEEL AND
YOU HAVE TO LEVEL WITH THE BLUES HERE
TIME MUST BE UP
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE IS CANADIAN
NOT A PERIOD PIECE
WELL IT'S HARD TO PREDICT SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A GUESSTIMATE THAN AN ESTIMATE BUT FORTY TO SIXTY TO THE
YOU CAN'T SAY DOUBT ABOUT THAT
AND THAT IS ALL THE MONEY
AND THAT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THEY NEED THE BONUS BUY OR NOT
YOU'VE GOT TWELVE OF THE
BUT THIS ONE OTHER THING EASTBOURNE IS FAMOUS FOR AND YOU WOULDN'T GUESS WHAT IT IS
THIS IS REAL QUALITY
BUT I'VE JUST BEEN TOLD THERE'S A PLACE NEARBY THAT'S VERY INTERESTING
THAT IS SUCH A DRAMATIC BACKDROP
IT'S A BLESSING SUSANZNE WASN'T HERE
NOW FOR THE JEWEL IN OUR CROWN
IT IS A MINEFIELD
THAT IS A SURPRISE
IT'LL BE SAD TO LEAVE
BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE DOING THOSE VALUATIONS
YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUST WATCH THESE IN THE EVENING WITH US
IT'S A TOP SPOT
WHO ARE THE WINNERS
BUT HERE OF COURSE THERE'S LOTS OF NOCTURNAL ANIMALS
WE'VE GOT OUR LIVE CAMERAS OUT AND ABOUT
CLOSE TO WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT
VIDEO PICTURES OF IT BUT
THE COCOONS CAN SURVIVE ALMOST INDEFINITELY SO WHEN THE FLOODS RECEDE
AT THAT SORT OF SIZE
WHICH IS A REAL SHAME
THEY MAY NOT BE SEXY
THIS IS A WAY OF FINDING OUT WHAT'S AROUND HERE
WE HILLING OFF DOWN TO THE RIVER
BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT OXFORD UNIVERSITY WANT TO EXPLORE MORE ABOUT
AND THEY WANT YOU TO GET INVOLVED SO
WE WANT AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE THIS WEEK TO GET INVOLVED IN A BIRD TABLE EXPERIMENT
WHAT IS THE EXPERIMENT
AND THAT'S EITHER GOING TO BE CHEESE OR APPLE
IF YOUR SURNAME IS A TO L YOU PUT OUT CHEESE
TOMORROW YOU PUT OUT YOUR NORMAL FOOD
IF YOU ARE STILL NOT SURE
THEN YOU CAN JOIN IN WITH US LIVE TOMORROW ON WINTERWATCH EXTRA THATS
AND THE REASON IT'S BEEN SO MILD
THE POWERFUL JET STREAM ACROSS THE ATLANTIC GENERATING STORM AFTER STORM COMING OUR WAY
AND DON'T WE KNOW IT
WE'RE ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH
THAT TOTAL SO FAR REPRESENTS MORE THAN WHAT WE WOULD NORMALLY EXPECT TO GET IN THE WHOLE OF WINTER
WHERE YOU ARE YOU HAVE TO GO HIGHER UP INTO THE CAIRNGORMS TO GET THAT SNOW
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING THIS WEEK
WE WILL BE BACK TOMORROW AT A DIFFERENT TIME
WHAT'S GOING ON WE WANT
I HEADED BACK TO BRIGHTON
I NEED TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION MORE BETTER THAN COMBAT
GET OUT OF THE WAY
VICTORY OR DEATH
HE'S NOT MENTIONING
THE THE PURGES OR THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO DIED DURING THE COLLECTIVISATION OF AGRICULTURE
IT'S IT'S NOT BEEN AN EASY PREGNANCY
HOPEFULLY NOT TOO EXPENSIVE
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS
IT'S WHETHER IT'S GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT
THAT MINDSET OF
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
WHY DON'T WE CHECK OUT WHAT THE BLUE TEAM BOUGHT
WE'RE HEADING OFF TO THE DEPTHS OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE TO LOVELY SNOW HILL
THE CONDITION WON'T HELP
THE ONLY COMMENT I CAN MAKE IS
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FOR FIFTEEN
WELL THE AUCTION ESTIMATE IS FOUR TO SIX HUNDRED
DON'T GO FOR IT
I FANCY IT'LL MAKE
BETWEEN TWO AND THREE THOUSAND
BUT THAT DEFINITELY WAS NOT THE CASE LAST NIGHT
THROUGH THE KITCHEN
YOU LAST NIGHT YOU WILL KNOW THAT WEVE JOINED UP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF BRIGHTON IN AN EXPERIMENT A STUDY
THE BIG QUESTION WAS
AND TO DO THAT WE HAVE GOT CAMERAS AND CAMERA TEAMS ALL OVER THE HIGHLANDS
WHAT THEY DO IS THEY HUNKER DOWN
KNOW THAT JUST BEFORE IT GOT DARK
THESE BIRDS WILL STAY PUT
HOME TO A GREAT NUMBER OF EXCITING SPECIES AND ONE
UM BECAUSE WE' BUILT EVEN MORE HOUSES
ONES WHICH LIVE IN THE INNER CITY
NICE BIRDS AS WELL
AND WHEN IT GETS COLD
BADGERS LOVE THEM
SEE YOU IN A MINUTE
OUR THERMAL CAMERA ALSO IS OUTSIDE
THEY STICK WITH IT
I HAD THE TORCH
AND WE WERE BOTH LOOKING FOR THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR
THEN LET US KNOW
NOW WE KNOW THEY GO A LOT FURTHER
FOXES ONLY BECAME URBANISED IN THE NINETEEN THIRTY S WHEN WE STARTED BUILDING SUBURBIA
IT WAS THAT THAT LURED THEM INTO OUR CITY
THIS THERE ARE SOME LINKS ON OUR WEBSITE
IN FACT THEY ARE THE OLDEST LIVING ORGANISMS THAT WE HAVE ON THE PLANET
THEY WEREN'T ON THE LEG THE QUESTION IS
WHERE WERE THEY
NOW WE ONLY REALLY HAVE THE SMALL PREDATORS LEFT
BUT IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY
THEY ARE ALL FLYING SPECIES
OVER A DECADE AGO
I WAS INVOLVED IN TWO REMARKABLE EXCAVATIONS OF THE BURIALS OF IRON AGE WOMEN
THAT IS THE ACTUAL BUILDING THERE
THERE WAS A SUGGESTION THAT SHE HADN'T DIED OF TB
SOMETHING THAT DOES HAPPEN OCCASIONALLY DURING THE IRON AGE
THEN THIS PLACE WOULD BE NOT SO MUCH A PLACE OF MOURNING
BUT OF SOMETHING MUCH
ANIMAL BONE RUBBISH
BUT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PART OF A CHOSEN FEW
OR EVEN A CHOSEN MANY
WAS THIS A CEMETERY FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY
I THINK WHAT THIS NEW EVIDENCE HAS DONE IS SHOWN THAT THE IDEA OF THIS GIRL BEING A HUMAN SACRIFICE
WE NOW KNOW THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE A SPIRITUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH WATER
THAT BEING DISEASED OR BADLY INJURED MIGHT BE WHAT SINGLED YOU OUT AS BEING SPECIAL
THROUGHOUT MANY PARTS OF BRITAIN
THAT MEANS THEY ARE PROBABLY PLACED IN TREES
SO THEY GET TREATED IN ACTUALLY A VERY SPECIAL WAY
THEY'RE NOT EATING MUCH FISH
AND AT THE TIME
I'M SURE YOU'D JUST BE BOUNCED OFF THE BACK OF IT
THEN IT MUST BE FOR A MAN
ALL OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE CHARIOT AND THE HARNESS FITTINGS ENABLED US TO RECONSTRUCT THE WHOLE THING
IT WAS GOING TO SPRING ONE FINAL SURPRISE
A BEAUTIFUL OBJECT SAYING WEALTH AND PRESTIGE
WE HAVE MIRRORS
WE ARE SO USED TO SEEING OUR REFLECTION
IT COMES WITH A WHOLE SERIES OF MEANINGS
YOU'VE CHOSEN OTTER
WHEREAS THEY ARE SEPARATE IN STATUS
THE MOST SACREDLY CHARGED OBJECT THAT THAT WOMAN WAS BURIED WITH
WE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A DIFFERENT NATIONAL IDENTITY
WE MIGHT EVEN SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT THE REMAINS EXHUMED FROM THE UNMARKED GRAVE
AND IF THEY DO TURN OUT TO BE THOSE OF ALFRED
THEN THEY CAN BE REBURIED WITH ALL THE DIGNITY THEY DESERVE
BUT THAT WAS ONLY THE START OF THE STORY
SO IN HONOUR OF HIS FATHER
JUST FOUR YEARS AFTER HIS BURIAL
BY THE NINTH CENTURY
BUT THEY WERE SOON ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT MAKING PILGRIMAGES TO ROME
THE FIRST IN EIGHT FIVE THREE WHEN THE BOY WAS JUST FOUR YEARS OLD
THESE VISITS TO THE MOST IMPRESSIVE AND POWERFUL CITY IN THE WESTERN WORLD MADE A HUGE IMPRESSION
AND OVER TIME IT BECAME A PERMANENT SAXON BASE
BECAUSE HE WAS TO GROW INTO A COMMITTED
THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A SPECIAL CEREMONY TO HONOUR A SON OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF WESSEX
HER MOTHER WAS A MEMBER OF THE MERCIAN ROYAL FAMILY
AND EFFECTIVE FOR YEARS TO COME
WHEN ALFRED WAS CELEBRATING THE YULEIDEDE AT CHIPPENHAM
GUTHRUM AND HIS MEN MOUNTED A SURPRISE ATTACK
ALFRED HAD FOUGHT ALONGSIDE HIS BROTHERS SO HE WAS NO STRANGER TO THE BATTLEFIELD
BUT ALSO TRACES OF IRON SMELTING
WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE THAT HE AND HIS MEN WERE SMELTING WEAPONS WHILE THEY SPENT TIME UP HERE IN
EVENTUALLY BECOMING LORD CHANCELLOR HIMSELF
AND ALL THE WHILE
IT BECAME LITTLE MORE THAN A FINE STONE QUARRY TO BE USED FOR BUILDING AND REBUILDING ALL OVER THE
BEGINNING WITH HIS CAPITAL
ABOUT ONE ATOM IN A TRILLION ATOMS OF CARBON IS RADIOACTIVE CARBON OR RADIOCARBON
AND MR PAGE TOLD HIM THAT IN ADVANCE OF THE BUILDING WORK
THE REVEREND WILLIAM WILLIAMS
OR MORE THAN ONE
AS FAR AS WE KNOW
BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE THAT ONE PIECE
TO DO FURTHER EXCAVATION ON THIS SITE TO SEE WHAT ELSE IS TURNED UP
WORDS CAN'T SAY
BUT YES IT'S ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT STEP I THINK
ANY BOY WHO DOESN'T HAND HIS HOMEWORK IN NOW
JUST OFF THAT LOVELY ROMAN ROAD CALLED THE FOSSE WAY
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
WILL THE EXPERTS BE ABLE TO KEEP OUR TEAMS ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW AS THEY BROWSE THESE VAST
AH MAYBE EVEN SOMETHING ORIENTAL
I'M THINKING THE FROG
I THINK WE GO FOR IT
I KNOW MODERN TEA COMPANIES DO THE SAME THING
WE NEED TO FIND CHRIS
SO THEY'RE PRETTY WELL ON THE MONEY
THE WAY THINGS ARE LOOKING
YOU ARE PLUS FORTY SIX
AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE CLUB WERE GIVEN NAMES OF BIRDS AND BEASTS AND MYTHICAL FIGURES
NEVERTHELESS IT' IS REGARDED AS ONE OF HIS FINEST PIECES
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD COME TO LOOK AT IT
BUT IT SHOWS THAT SHE IS SO HANDS ON
WHICH WE CAN'T SEE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE SHUTTERS ARE CLOSED FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES
AND NIECES AND NEPHEWS
AND IT IS QUITE VALUABLE
I'M TV'S ROBERT WEBB AND TONIGHT I'M GOING TO TANTALISE YOU WITH JUST A FEW OF POP'S GREATEST DANCE
TOMORROW MORNING LOOK THE BBC HAVE GOT A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF CAMERAS
SAYING HE DIDN'T HAVE A WARM HAT ON
WE SENT HIM OUT INTO THE RIVER
THE TERRITORY HOLDER DID WIN THAT ONE
WE GOING TO BE FOLLOWING THE SOURCE OF WATER FROM THE HIGH PEAKS RIGHT DOWN TO THE SEA AND LOOKING AT THE
AS THE LIGHT COMES UP
IF THEY ARE HUNGRY
FOXES BUGERS AND STRAY CATS FEEDING TOGETHER
IN PARTICULAR AROUND THE KENORMS IN THE HIGHLANDS
HERE BUT WHAT ABOUT WILDLIFE CLOSER TO HOME
HOW DOES THAT SURVIVE
WELL BEFORE WE FIND OUT
FOXES CAN BE QUITE VOCAL
TO SEE IF WE COULD GET THE FOXES TO CALL BACK
AND WE GOT A COMMENT THAT CAME IN FROM HEATHER HOLLAND ON FACEBOOK WHO SAYS SHE WENT AWAY FOR A FEW DAYS AND CAME
COMPLETELY MYSTERIOUS THING
SO FROM THE TWO VERY EXCITED GUYS ON THE SCENE OF CLUELE
WE HAVE GOT JAKE
HOLDING THE NUT STEADY
PHYSICAL OR SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT
YOU COULD BE FINED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
THE WORLD WILL BE WATCHING
THAT AND YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE COMPLETED MY LEG OF THE JOURNEY
WHICH WAS A VERY LONG JOURNEY BUT
COMING UP WITH THEIR EXPERT VALUATIONS AND THEN
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN ENGRAVED
THEY MEAN A LOT TO ME
I AGREE WITH THE VALUATION
THEY WANTED SOMETHING MORE CONTEMPORARY AND MODERN
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO SHOW ME A MILL
THAT WAS THAT WAS A BIT TRICKY
IT'S BEEN DELIGHTFUL
I THINK I'D FIT IN REALLY WELL BECAUSE MY HEAD IS DEFINITELY IN THE CLOUDS BUT MY FEET ARE FIRMLY
OBVIOUSLY YOU DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR
SO WHATEVER YOU DO
LINDA CERTAINLY WAS THE JEWEL IN OUR CROWN
WE HAVE A TRUNCHEON
WE CARRY IT CONCEALED ABOUT US
OR SEE A MAN LIKE ME
IT WAS HIS IDEA
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT IN THE FIRST PLACE
WHY NOT SELL MYSELF FOR A BIT LONGER
AND GET SOME MONEY THAT I CAN ENJOY
SHOULDER LENGTHTH DARK HAIR
QUITE REGULARLY OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS
AND EACH ANIMAL HAS A DIFFERENT STRATEGY
FOR INSTANCE HEDGEHOGS HIBERNATE
MY PREDICTION IS IT'S GOING TO GET COLDER
AND TALKING OF PREDICTIONS
COURSE ON THE PROWL FOR FOOD
BUT IVE COME DOWN HERE TO THE FLOOD PLAIN
THIS ISN'T THE CASE AND THIS IS INFLUENCING THE WAY THAT WE ARE CHANGING OUR MIND WHEN IT COMES TO
ALL VERY EXCITING STUFF
THAT'S BEFORE THEY START THEIR BREEDING
AND VOLES WITH VOLES IT'S ALL A NUMBERS GAME
WE HAVE DONE THE CALCULATION
SAID WE HAD ONE IN THE MOWER STARTED IT UP TO FIND THE GRASS NOT COMING OUT INTO THE BASKET
TOOK OFF THE PIPE GAVE IT A SHAKE AND OUT FELL A HEDGEHOG WITH ITS NESTING MATERIAL
FEW ROLLED OUT ONTO THE FLOOR ALONG WITH MR HEDGEHOG
SO I THINK BASICALLY WHAT THIS IS TELLING US IS BEFORE YOU SET FIRE
IF YOU WANT MORE ADVICE THERE' IS PLENTY OF IT ON OUR WEBSITE
WHEN I WAS A KID
NOT THAT LONG AGO
WE THOUGHT THAT HEDGEHOGS WENT TO SLEEP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WINTER
PAUL TAYLOR SAYS SEVEN STARLINGS
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT IT
AND THIS WEEKEND IS PRETTY SPECIAL
THE WORLD'S LARGEST WILDLIFE SURVEY
WELL ALL EYES ON THE GARDEN BIRD WATCH THIS WEEKEND
JANUARY IN THE UK
NO SEVERE COLD THIS WEEKEND MORE RAIN
THIS IS THE VIEW OF THE UK FROM SPACE THE WHITE IS SNOW COVER
VICKI HOBAN SAYS LOADS OF BIRDS IN FULL SONG AROUND OUR WAY THIS WEEK
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME
SUSAN BREWER SAYS
SO WE CAN BRING YOU MORE OF THIS ACTIVITY WHEN IT'S AT ITS PEAK
WE WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND A MASSIVE THANK YOU TO THE NATIONAL TRUST OF SCOTLAND
MEAN HE HASS GONE GLOBAL
ORIGINALLY I WAS GOING TO DO MEDICINE
WHAT ABOUT FOR YOU
MAYBE SOMETHING EMBROIDERY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
I'M HEADING OFF TO LONDON TO HAVE A LOOK AT SOME RIGHT ROYAL MILITARY HISTORY
THIS THING HAS A PECULIAR FEATURE
TWENTY FIVE POUNDS YOU PAID FOR THAT
WHO I BET HAVE ALSO BEEN CALLED STRANGE NAMES IN THEIR TIME
SO LET'S SEE WHAT THEY CAN FIND AT TODAY'S VENUE
I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING
THE MAN WITH ALL THE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
THIS IS MY VALUATION
STORY WE ALL LOVE
AND IT'S ALSO AN ESSENTIAL ITEM IN THE RATION KIT OF THE BRITISH ARMY
YOU'VE GUESSED IT
WHICH I'M AT NOW
I BET YOU CAN'T GUESS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
AND WELCOME TO MASTERMIND WITH ME
CHARLES RENNIE MACKINTOSH
ONE CONTENT WAY OUT IN FRONT
DEALS ON WHEELS
SHE WAS GOING TO STAY AROUND AND PLAY HAPPY FAMILIES
YOU HAVE NO IDEA AT ALL
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
MADE ME THE CENTRE OF EVERYTHING
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO
BUT SHE DIDN'T SAY NO
YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T JUST PRETEND THAT THEY DON'T EXIST
CAN I JUST HAVE FIVE MINUTES WHERE I DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT CANCER
SORRY TO PERSIST
AND WHATEVER HAPPENS
GET READY FOR A GOURMET'S GREATEST HIT
THAT'S VERY PURE WATER
BUT LET'S START BY JOINING RICK STEIN
A BIT IMMATURE AND LACKING IN FLAVOUR
WHAT'S THE POINT
IT'S JUST LIKE A SILLY GARNISH
WHAT I'D USE THIS FOR IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SOUPS
AND IT MAKES IT ALL NICE AND FLUFFY
ACCORDING TO THY O MAN
JUST A SEMI SET CREAM
IT'S A FROZEN CREAM
VERY DIFFICULT TO GET HOLD OF
A BIG THANK YOU TO ALL OUR CHEFS TODAY
TODAY'S PROGRAMME IS COMING FROM THE SUNNY SOUTH WEST
THE GREAT THING
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHICH WE WILL TALK ABOUT
I LOVE THE MICROSCOPE
HALF THIS WOULDN'T MEAN A THING
THAT'S WHAT I THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING
AND THE REAL THING IS
THAT'S THE FLAVOUR OF THE MONTH
THEN THINK AGAIN
HE WASN'T PUT OFF HIS LATEST COMMISSION
SO CALLED BECAUSE THEY WERE BOUND IN A MOROCCAN RED LEATHER
EACH ONE MADE FOR A PARTICULAR CLIENT
LET'S FIND OUT FROM HEAD GARDENER SIMON WOOD
THIS ONE FOR THE DUKE OF BEDFORD
AND HE WAS BORN IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
I DON'T BLAME YOU
I CLEANED IT WITH SOME MUTTON CLOTH
I'M NO STRANGER TO SORROW
WELL IT'S TOO LATE NOW
THE BATTLE WAS LOST
AND THAT WOULD BE AN ABOMINATION
WE DID HAVE A GOOD NIGHT TO START WITH
MOSTLY I'M FINE
WHY DID THEY PUT THEM ON THE BACK
I'VE MADE THE ULTIMATE SEDUCTION PLAYLIST
I'M NOT BE A FUCKING SENDDERELLA
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE SEX WITH A SLAPPER
OF COURSE I DID
MY MONEY WAS ON NA RUSH
I HAVE THE UPPER HAND
NO ONE DOES TWO
WE SHOULD GET GOING
YOU PROMISE SHE'S NOT GOING TO FIND A BETTER MAN
ESPECIALLY NOW SHE'S UP THE DUFF
SAY YOU'LL THROW IN A ROLLING
SO I NEED TO FIND A WAY OF SUPPORTING MYSELF IN UNIVERSITY WHILST PAYING FOR A BABY
NO QUESTIONS ASKED DIVORCE OPTION
THREW THE RING AWAY AND THEN CHUCKED ME OFF THE PROPERTY
IT MIGHT BE BETTER NOT TO GO THROUGH THE FAMILY GP
I'M A HEAD OF MARKETING FOR PREPAID CURRENCY CARDS
I'M TERRIBLY EXCITED FOR YOU
BECAUSE THE SWASTIKA
AS A MOTIF AND EMBLEM
THE BIG QUESTION OF COURSE FOR OUR TEAMS TODAY OVER AT THE AUCTION IS
YOUR CHOICE WILL COME LATER BUT
PROBABLY IN BIRMINGHAM
I THINK IT'S WORTH
EVEN IF HE'S GOT SIX CARRIAGE CLOCKS IN HIS CELL
WORKING WITH HIS HANDS
THE PUPIL SHOULD EXCEED THE MASTER OR THE MASTER HAS FAILED
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE WITH AGE
HOW MUCH IS THIS GOING FOR
PRESSURE BUILDING RIGHT NOW
IT ALMOST READS LIKE A LOVE LETTER FOR THE INTENDED
WELL DO YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT TALKING ABOUT WORKS OF ART
THIS IS REALLY DEAR TO ME
CAN WE GO BACK AND FINISH IT OFF
IT'S BEEN SO INSPIRATIONAL
AND IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO PAY HIM A VISIT
IN YOUR HANDS ENTIRELY
IS ANOTHER SALE ROOM ON ANOTHER DAY
WE DON'T LIKE THAT
A SHOPPING TRIP IN NEW YORK AND POSSIBLY
MOSAICS OF HABITATS OF HEATH
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE HILLS AND THE CATCHMENT OF THE RIVERS
NONATIVE CONIFERS WHICH WERE THEN LEFT TO GROW WILD
IT'S TRYING TO GET THAT BALANCE ISN'T
AND THEY WOULD ALL EAT TOGETHER
AND WILDLIFE ON THE OTHER
FOR THE MONEY THAT COULD BE MADE THROUGH BETTER CARBON STORAGE AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT
AND IT WAS TRICKY ALL ROUND
WE HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE COWS
AND THE FIRST RESULTS THAT CAME BACK WERE FROM ERIC
SO HE'S GOT TO GO
SO I DON'T REALLY WANT TO SEND HIM TO SLAUGHTER
IMPROVING THE BREED
DUAL PURPOSE BACK IN THE DAY
IS SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
BUT BEFORE THAT
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE WEATHER WILL BE LIKE THIS WEEK
IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO CELEBRATING NEW YEAR
THEY'VE BEEN OUT OF STEP WITH THE REST OF US FOR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS NOW
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY STILL FOLLOW THE JULIAN CALENDAR
IT WAS MUCH MORE ACCURATE THAN THE OLD ONE
WELCOME TO THE DRAGONS' DEN
THE DEN REOPENS ITS DOORS TO A FRESH BATCH OF CASH HUNGRY ENTREPRENEURS
THE STAKES ARE HIGH
SUCCEED AND THEY SECURE THE BACKING OF A MULTIMILLIONAIRE INVESTOR
AND WE START WITH AN INVENTOR WHO WANTS TO BRING THE BATH INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY
IT'S NOT A PRODUCT
AFTER THAT LITTLE CONVERSATION FROM ME
YOU'VE DONE GLASTONBURY
THE ISLE OF WIGHT
YOU'VE HAD TEA IN THE PARK
THAT'S WHAT OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEURS HOPE
WITH A NICHE HOLIDAY BUSINESS AIMED AT THOSE WHO WANT A TASTE OF FESTIVAL ACTION SOMEWHERE IN THE
WHEN THE WHOLE OF A PACKAGE TOUR INDUSTRY RUNS AT ABOUT TEN
THAT IS WHY WE REQUIRE TO HAVE FIVE CENT TURNOVER AS FREE CASH FLOW
SO IF ONE OF OUR HOTELS DOES DOES HAVE A CATASTROPHE
SO IT WOULD GENERALLY BE
THAT'S MORE THAN ONE FOR EACH PERSON
AND IT CERTAINLY MEANS THAT ONE HAZARD OF MODERN LIFE IS THAT OF DAMAGING A MOBILE HANDSET
OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEUR BELIEVES HE HAS A SOLUTION
THERE ARE SAY REPAIR SERVICES THAT CAN REPAIR PHONES BUT
THIS IS WHAT I WOULD BUY AT AN AIRPORT TO TAKE ON HOLIDAY
WHEN I DID EXACTLY THAT THING
WHICH WAS DROP MY PHONE
JUST A MEMBER OF YOUR STAFF
HAVE YOU ALSO REALISED
I'M WAY SMARTER THAN YOU HAD
IT WAS ALSO THE INSPIRATION FOR GILBERT AND SULLIVAN'S MOST FAMOUS MUSICAL BADDIES
IN THE WINTER OF NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT
BECAUSE HE'S SO YOUNG
EIGHTY FIVE POUNDS IT FETCHED IN THE ROOM
IT'S WELL IT'S NOT BEEN CLEAN FOR A LONG TIME
HENCE SIX TO EIGHT HUNDRED
BUT KATE THINKS THE RULES ARE THERE TO BE BROKEN
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOSER IN THAT EQUATION
AND THEY BUY A CHICKEN
WHEREAS SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW
SHE WANTS TO THROW IT AWAY
YOU READY FOR THIS
ONCE THE PRIME CUTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF A CARCASS
EVERYTHING ELSE FINDS ITS WAY TO THE MINCER
NOTHING IS WASTED
AWARD WINNING CHEF STEVIE PALM THINKS THIS MEANS WE'RE MISSING OUT ON SOME OF THE BEST BITS THE
CHICKEN IS THE MOST POPULAR MEAT IN BRITAIN
I BELIEVE IT'S TIME WE GAVE THEM THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE
HOW GOOD WOULD THAT BE
I SAW SOMETHING
I THINK THE FACT THAT WE'RE SEEING YOU AGAIN REFLECTS HOW COMMITTED WE ARE TO MAKING THIS WORK
GONE SEVERAL DATES
JUST YOU AND ME
JAMIE'S GOT HIS FRIENDS AND YOU'VE GOT YOURS
ARE YOU A COMPETITIVE MAN WOULD YOU SAY
THREE COUNTIES LEVEL
LOOKS A BIT LIKE A FOUR INCH SHELL FROM AN ARTILLERY PIECE
YEAH AND IT WAS ONLY FOLLOWING BETTY'S DEATH IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THAT WE HAVE HAD
WHEN THE NATIONAL TRUST TOOK IT OVER
FOR THE VIEWERS
I START THE BIDDING HERE AT FIFTEEN
BUT IF WE KEEP THAT FIGURE AT TWO TO THREE HUNDRED
SO LET'S CATCH UP WITH TODAY'S AUCTIONEER
DAD'LL BE SO PLEASED
IT'S NOT STODGY
AND IT'S NOT OBVIOUS
YOUVE GOT TO SEE THEM IN THEIR CORRECT SURROUNDINGS
SO YOU CAN HAVE ONE ROTATION PER DAY
WE'VE GOT SUSAN AND THE UMBRELLA STAND
YOU MIGHT FIND SOMETHING HERE
ANYONE ELSE QUICKLY
LOTS OF MEMORIES
I DON'T BELIEVE IT
WHAT A LOVELY MOMENT THAT WAS
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THE SHOW
WE'VE CERTAINLY ENJOYED OURSELVES
THANKS TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OVER THERE
AND THEREFORE LIKELY TO BE VERY SUNNY
I KNOW YOU HAVE
BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS SENT IN A PICTURE
WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT
HAD THOUSANDS OF HOUSES AND FLATS
BUT NO PEOPLE AT ALL
WHAT CAN POSSIBLY GO WRONG WITH THAT
THAT AIRPORT IS NOT A FILM SET
IT OPENED FIVE YEARS AGO
THEN IT WENT BUST
THEN IT CLOSED DOWN LAST YEAR
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
WHEN I WAS BORN
OR AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF NEXT
IT IS A BIT LIKE
I WASN'T A TREY
I WATCHED THE FIRST FILM
I WAS VERY INTO THAT
BUT I'VE ALWAYS LIKED IT
RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH
IT WAS VERY SCARY
THE WHOLE THING WENT ON FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS
WE SPENT THE NIGHT IN AN UNWANTED HOUSE
BECAUSE UNLIKE THE TIME OF THE ROMANS THAT CAME BEFORE AND THE LATER ANGLO SAXON PERIOD
ONCE IN A LIFETIME
BECAUSE OF HIS STRENGTH
SOMEWHERE OVER THERE TO THE EAST
PART OF THE INITIAL WAVE OF WARRIOR OPPORTUNISTS WHO CAME AND SEIZED POWER AND LAND IN THIS PART OF
SO IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY THAT SURPRISING THAT THEY MIGHT START TO HAVE A WEAPON SET AT THAT POINT
POSSIBLY FOR ALL THREE CEMETERIES
NOT ONLY AROUND THEM BUT
REALLY DID MATTER FOR THEM
WHAT YOU NEED IS TO CAST THE NET A LOT WIDER AND THAT'S WHAT ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND SCIENTISTS HAVE
IDEALLY PEOPLE FROM THE SAME COMMUNITY
OR AT THE SAME TIME
WHAT ABOUT THE LOCALS
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING HERE WHEN THE ANGLO SAXONS ARRIVED
WHAT'S EVEN MORE INTERESTING IS THAT WE'RE NOW STARTING TO GET A HANDLE ON THE SIZE OF THE ANGLO
THE FIFTH AND SIXTH CENTURIES
AT THIS TIME THAT WE CALL THE DARK AGES
LEFT A LASTING LEGACY
AND IN AN EVEN MORE FASCINATING WAY
EACH SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE
HAS TAKEN US ONE STEP CLOSER TO UNDERSTANDING WHO THESE PEOPLE WERE
THE BIG QUESTION IS
I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
BECAUSE LAST TIME I
LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
AND THAT WILL COST YOU THIRTY EIGHT
ON THAT HAPPY NOTE THEY COULD NEED THEIR BONUS BUY
WHICH IS VERY PECULIAR
OXFORD GREEN AND HE KNOWS THAT THIS IS AN EXCELLENT COLOUR TO DISPLAY
IT COULD BE YOURS FOR TWENTY EIGHT
I'M PRETTY SURE OF THAT
HE'S VERY KEEN ON NEW
AND IT WILL BE AN ABSOLUTE BARGAIN AT ONE HUNDRED
WHO WAS DISTANTLY AND ILLEGITIMATELY RELATED TO THE HOUSE OF LANCASTER THROUGH HIS MOTHER
SOUGHT TO CHALLENGE RICHARD FOR THE THRONE
HENRY TUDOR MARCHED ON ENGLAND AND HENRY
IF THEY WERE STILL ALIVE AFTER THE BATTLE OF BOSWORTH
THEY'D HAVE BEEN AN EXTREME EMBARRASSMENT TO HIM
HE WAS GOING TO MARRY THEIR SISTER
AND IF HE THEN MADE HER LEGITIMATE
IF HE KILLS HIS RIVAL
AND THE REST AS THEY SAY
SOME WOULD SAY IT'S AN ACQUIRED TASTE
THINK YOU'D HAVE TO PUT SOME SORT OF BASE IN TO PUT THE FLOWERS IN
AND SURE ENOUGH
BUT THE THING IS
CHARLIE ROSS WAS SPOT ON
TEDDIES WERE THE FIRST THING THEY MADE
YOU'VE GUESSED IT
IT IS NOW TIME FOR THE AUCTION
AND WE WANT SOME HAMMER ACTION
THESE KIND OF PAINTINGS WHICH ARE OF MOORLAND SCENES
WE HOPE TO FLOG THE BIGGEST MOBILE PHONE IN THE WORLD
THAT'S A GREAT NAME
HE WAS AN ESTABLISHED ARTIST AND ILLUSTRATOR
AND HE TOOK PITY ON THE FISHERMEN
WHAT'S THE NEXT STAGE
I HAVE SEEN A COUPLE QUITE RECENTLY
I THINK YOU PAID THE RIGHT PRICE
IT'S VERY HARD TO CHOOSE SOMEWHERE TO GO ON HOLIDAY ISN'T IT BECAUSE ALL THE HOLIDAY
WE'VE JUST BEEN JOINED BY DELLA AND PETER
THE BITS WITH ME
FORMER HOME OF THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE
OUR MISSION TODAY IS SIMPLE
OUR TEAMS HAVE SIXTY MINUTES TO FIND THREE ITEMS WITH THREE HUNDRED POUNDS TO TAKE AND SELL AT AUCTION
I'VE GOT FAMILY THERE
AND I EXPECT SHE HAD MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED POUNDS TO SPEND
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL OUR TEAMS HAVE GOT
GIVE UP OUR JOBS
THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THIS DOLPHIN HERE
I HAVE TO BE HONEST
WOULD YOU GUYS BE HAPPY AT SEVENTY FIVE
WHICH IT DID UNTIL EIGHTY NINETY NINE
SHE ENCOUNTERED THE GERMAN CRUISER
HE TURNED TAIL AND RAN FOR IT
SO THIS WAS GOING TO BE NO CONTEST
WHICH WAS A DANGEROUS THING TO DO
HE WAS A BRAVE MAN
HE HAD THREE HUNDRED FRENCH RESERVISTS ON BOARD AND A VALUABLE CARGO AND HE DID NOT WANT
HE GOT THE DSO THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE ORDER
ALL THAT HISTORY IS AVAILABLE TO ANY ONE OF US COMING TO A FAIR LIKE THIS
THERE WE HAVE IT
WE'VE GONE A BIT LOWER THAN THAT
AK'S ONE OF THOSE ICONIC NAMES
I'M LIKING THAT VERY MUCH
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
THE RIGHT PEOPLE WILL SEE IT
I THINK IT COULD HAVE GONE THE OTHER WAY
FOUR MORE CONTENDERS WILL SIT IN THAT INFAMOUS BLACK CHAIR
WHERE THEY WILL ANSWER TWO MINUTES OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND TWO AND HALF MINUTES ON
WE MUST HAVE A TIE BREAK
THE SIX HIGHEST SCORING RUNNERS UP BY THE WAY FROM THIS ROUND WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO CLAIM A PLACE IN THE
SO LOTS TO PLAY FOR
I CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT
YOU'VE GOT A PUB
THERE'S A FEW PROBLEMS
WE'VE GOT ALL YOUR FAVOURITES HERE
THE NATION'S TOP TV CHEFS ALL IN ONE PLACE
ON THE A AHEAD OF TV COOKING
THERE AREN'T VERY MANY RECIPES THAT BEGIN WITH THE LETTER X
EXOTIC FRUIT RAVIOLI
IT'S A DISH FROM THE NORTH
BY TWO CHEFS FROM THE NORTH
I LIKE STUFFING ON CHICKENS
AND VERY FEW PEOPLE MAKE STUFFING WITH BEEF
GROWING UP IN AUSTRALIA
SO ALL THE GOOD BITS
DON'T START TO CARVE IT NOW
IT NEEDS TO RELAX
WE'VE REACHED THE END OF THIS SHOW
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH ALL OUR FANTASTIC CHEFS
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
WE'RE HEADING OFF DOWN THE ROAD
IN MY HOME COUNTY
MYSTICAL SITES PEPPERED ALL OVER THE LANDSCAPE HERE
FROM SILBURY HILL TO STONEHENGE AND AVEBURY
BECAUSE I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THAT
NOTHING DON'T WAKE ME
FOR A MOMENT IN TIME
I THINK AT AUCTION TODAY
I WOULD BE GOING
I WENT OUTSIDE WITH THE
I CAN'T PROVE THERE'S NOT AN INVISIBLE UNICORN WELDING A TURD TO THE ROOF OF THIS BUILDING
YOU CAN STILL DEFINITELY BE THERE
I'M JUST GOING OUT TO BUY SOME WINE
BEING PREVENTED FROM TAKING BREAKS
WHEREVER IT WAS
BY STEALING MY JOB AND THEN CONCEALING IT FROM ME
I DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM
OUT INTO A SERIES OF SPRINGS WHICH ARE DOTTED ALL AROUND THE TOWN
LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY
AND THEN WE'VE WE'VE HAD A LOOK AT THE MARKS
IT'S A LOVELY OBJECT
I THINK THAT ON ITS OWN
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS
THERE ARE COLLECTORS OUT THERE
PUT IT ON THE WALL
THIS WHOLE AREA WAS THE ROYAL DATON FACTORY
IT WAS HUGELY FASHIONABLE BUT
TASTES DO CHANGE AND MANY OF THE BIG MANUFACTURERS WENT OUT OF BUSINESS
MANY OF THE TRADITIONAL METHODS ARE STILL GOING ON AROUND ME RIGHT NOW
BUT NOW THIS SITE PROVIDES STUDIO SPACE AND WORKSHOPS FOR MANY ARTISANS BOTH IN TRADITIONAL AND
BUT ALSO MANY OTHER CRAFTS
SAME SORT OF TOOLS
PLEASE BELIEVE ME
HAVE A GO YOURSELF YOU'LL SEE
AND IT ALL WENT WRONG
HE'S ALSO A GREAT TEACHER
IT'S A REAL ICONIC CAR
LET'S HOPE IT'S WORKING FOR US NOW
BUT YOU RELAXED
IT WAS AMAZING THE EFFECT OF THE COLD
REMEMBER THAT WE WERE STILL IN THE AGE WHERE WE BLED PEOPLE
UM YOU COULDN'T HAVE PASTRIES
THEY DIDN'T LIKE SPICY FOOD
LET'S PRICE IT TO SELL
IT'LL GO IN A CONTEMPORARY FLAT
THAT CHAIR HAS COME FRESH FROM SOME OLD BOY'S COTTAGE SOMEWHERE
I DON'T WANT TO LET THEM DOWN
I THINK AS MANY AS TWO HUNDRED MINES
THE VERY CONTRARY
THAT'S A GREAT THING
FEEDING SWILL TO PIGS MIGHT CUT FOOD WASTE
REDUCE THE COST OF REARING PIGS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND HELP STRUGGLING PIG FARMERS
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE WASTE FED PORK TASTES PRETTY GOOD
THEY HAVE VERY SIMILAR DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS TO US AND THEY CAN EAT EVERYTHING THAT WE LEAVE
UNLIKE FARM ANIMALS
FEEDING STUFF LIKE THIS
THE COTTAGE INDUSTRY
REALLY UNHAPPY FEEDING IT TO THE PIGS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE ORIGINS OF THE FOOD NOW
I'D BE REALLY UNHAPPY BECAUSE THE PUBLIC WOULDN'T
I COULDN'T SELL THE PIGS WHEN I HAD FINISHED PRODUCING THE PIGS FEEDING SWILL
WHO EVEN GO AS FAR AS TO DESCRIBE THE PRACTICE OF FEEDING SWILL TO PIGS AS
THINGS LIKE FOOT AND MOUTH
CLASSICAL SWINE FEVER
IT WAS THE JURASSIC PERIOD
WHEN IT COMES TO FARMING
LIKE JURASSIC PARK
WITH ALL THE DINOSAURS
AND IT'S THOUGHT THAT THE AREA WOULD HAVE HAD A SHALLOW
A WARM SEA ACROSS IT
A FEW PUDDLES LYING AROUND
IT'S TWENTY ONE DAYS TODAY
THERE ARE FARMERS LIKE JAMES DOING EXACTLY THAT
IF YOU ARE HAPPY
THE QUESTION IS
AH JAMES HAS DONE THAT
THEY TOLD US TO GO AND BUY THREE OLD HOT HATCHES
AND ON THE TAILGATE
WE WERE BRAVE AND WE WERE STRONG
PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY
ARE YOU ALWAYS LATE FOR YOUR GAME OF GOLF
ARE YOU SICK OF BEING THE LAST TO THE LODGE
BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST EVOCATIVE WORDS IN MOTORING
TEAM IT WITH SALT FLATS
NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS
BUT IT IS TONIGHT'S STAR IN A REASONABLY PRICED CAR
THE BONNEVILLE SALT FLATS DON'T FEATURE HIGH MY PEDIGREE
THAT MUST BE REALLY ANNOYING
AND THE CAMERAMAN FELL IN THE GRAVE
MY CHARACTER MADE SUCH A SUCCESS OF ORGANISING THE OLYMPICS
I'M NOW THE GO TO MAN TO SORT OUT CORPORATE ISSUES
AH PAGE ONE WAS A PICTURE OF A FIRE ALARM
AND BEING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT
I'VE BEEN WONDERING
THINGS ARE NOT GOING WELL FOR ME
THE PERSON TRYING TO GET AWAY IS ALWAYS GOING LUDICROUSLY FAST
WELCOME BACK TO DRAGONS' DEN
WHERE WE'LL MEET MORE AMBITIOUS ENTREPRENEURS VYING FOR INVESTMENT FROM FIVE SELFMADE
WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A BABY BOOM AND OUR FIRST ENTREPRENEURS ARE HOPING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
THERE IS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR OUR COMPANY TO GROW RAPIDLY
AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR ONE HUNDRED TAIL
AS WE ORDER AND MAKE MORE
WITHIN TWO DAYS
WHEN I ASKED YOU ABOUT BOOTS
OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEURS WOULD BE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK
TEAM GB TRIATHLETE LYNWEN HARRISON IS HERE WITH HER BUSINESS PARTNER RACHEL SMITH AND THEIR
THEY'RE NOT JUST HERE TO TAKE PART
THEY'RE HERE TO WIN AN INVESTMENT
YOU'VE ALSO GOT
YOU'RE NOT USING ORGANIC FRUITS
OUR VISION WAS THAT
BUT I MIGHT BE A NOVICE AND I MIGHT NOT KNOW ENOUGH BUT
IT IS A PAPER RULER
I LAUNCHED MY COMPANY
THERE IS A PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITE FOR EVERYTHING THESE DAYS
SO IS THERE MONEY TO BE MADE BY ADDING ANOTHER ONE
NEXT INTO THE LIFT IS AMIR HASSAN WITH HIS IDEA TO HELP YOU SHOP AROUND FOR MINICABS
TEN MILLION TRIPS ARE TAKEN BY CAB OUT OF TOWN
SO IN THE FIRST YEAR
MAR IS THE MAL THE SAME OFFER
I ALWAYS WANTED DEBORAH AND I WANTED PETER AND I THOUGHT BETWEEN THEM
A DRAMATIC FINALE THERE
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT RELATIVELY FEW ENTREPRENEURS IN THE DEN HAVE THE NERVE TO SAY NO TO THE
HOWEVER FORMIDABLE THEY APPEAR
WHICH BRINGS THE DAY TO A CLOSE
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT ALL OF TONIGHT'S PITCHES CONTINUES ON TWITTER
USING THE HASHTAG DRAGONSDEN
YOU MESS UP THE KITCHEN WITH THE REST
LOOK IT'S EARLY DAYS
I AM VERY EXPERIENCED AT
IT WAS A FAST MOVING SITUATION
FIRST THING TOMORROW
YOU ALSO HAVE A LOVE OF ENTERTAINING
THEY GET SOME ANTIQUE PLATES SOMETIMES THEY DO AND SOME NICE GLASSES
IF I CAN BE BOTHERED TO WASH THEM UP
AND WEVE GOT MYRA AND SHEILA FOR THE BLUES
AH YOUR ERROR OF BARGAIN HUNTING IS ABOUT TO BEGIN
I THINK WE GOT A LOT TO SEE
THAT'S WHERE I'M AT
THE CREATIVE ARTS ARE NOW A BIG PART IN YOUR LIFE
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE THAT RETRO VINTAGE FEEL YEAH
IF IT COULD BE BOUGHT FOR FORTY
GOOD LUCK WITH ALL OF THAT
IT COULD BE YOURS
HERE TODAY IN SAWBRIDGEWORTH
ON THAT BASIS I'M GOING TO POP IT DOWN THERE
WHERE IT BELONGS
RIGHT THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
AND NOW MOVING ON TO THE BLUES
EVEN THE WORLD'S BEST FOOTBALLER WAS BORN HERE
AND IT CAME FROM MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE
MAYBE A SET OF CHAIRS
AND YOU CAN'T MISTAKE THIS FOR ANYTHING ELSE
WE HAD A RESERVE OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE
IT'S A GOOD RESULT
SO YOU HAVE IMPRESSED MARKS AND THE EARLY MARK
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA OF HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH
I THINK IT'S STRONG
IT'S IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
ETHICALLY SOURCED AND
IT CAN ONLY BE FIFTY PERCENT MURDER
JUST MOST OF THE FIRST FIVE YEARS
AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF ALL THE FOUNDRIES
BUT THIS REGION IS PARTICULARLY FAMOUS FOR ITS ENAMEL WORK
BUT WE'VE CERTAINLY GOT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AND PLENTY OF OBJECTS
WHILE WE MAKE OUR WAY OVER THERE
I KNOW YOU PAID QUITE A BIT FOR THIS
NOT THE MOST POPULAR COLOUR
JUST ABOUT ANYBODY WHO WAS ANYBODY IN FASHIONABLE GEORGIAN SOCIETY WOULD CARRY ONE AROUND
PULL THE DRAWERS OUT
HE'S BEEN LIKE THIS FOR DAYS
LAURA'S GOT A BOYFRIEND
I'M ABOUT TO FAIL MY EXAMS
NO GIRLFRIEND AND A CRAP LIFE
I NEED THE EXTRA SHIFTS BECAUSE MY HUSBAND IS OUT OF WORK
COVERED IN COCO POPS
AND SHAME ON YOU FOR THINKING THAT
I WANT YOU TO STOP FLIRTING WITH HIM
CLASSIC JEALOUS SABOTAGE TACTIC
HOW YOU'RE NOTHING LIKE HIS WIFE
VERY IMPORTANT JOB AS WELL
WE WERE TOGETHER WELL WE WERE TOGETHER AT THE THIRD YEAR OF UNIVERSITY
WHEREAS ADAM WAS A LOT BETTER AT ACTING
I LIKE THINGS THAT ARE A BIT DIFFERENT SO SOMETHING THAT WILL STAND OUT
FOLLOWING THAT DAY
TAKE THAT PIECE
FIVE YEARS' WORTH OF YOUR TIME WOULD BE A BIT MORE THAN THAT
YOU WERE MINUS TWENTY THREE
WHICH MEANS YOU ARE PLUS THIRTEEN PO
THAT'S MINUS TEN
AND BUT THAT'S JONY CLOSE
WE ALL LEARN A LESSON
BE SHIPPED EVERY MORNING
HAVE ASPARAGUS AND PEACHES AND AND FLOWERS FOR THE TABLE
WOULD ALL COME IN FROM THE COUNTRY ESTATES
THEY HAVE A BORDER
SUZANNE'S LOVELY BRACELET WITH SEMIRECIOUS STONES
UNFORTUNATELY SHE CAN'T BE WITH US HERE IN THE AUCTION
IT'S GOING UNDER THE HAMMER RIGHT NOW
CAN'T BE WITH US TODAY
THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THIS IS YOUR THING
I FOUND MYSELF REALLY
AND I REALLY WANTED HIM TO LIKE ME
SO LARA IS A BIT OF A LOCAL CELEB NOW
THEY HAVE TO BE CENTREED
SO POSITIVE THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY
BUT COMPARED TO SOME OF THE GIRLS' HOME LIVES
THEY'RE EXPECTED TO FIND THREE ITEMS WHICH THEY LATER SEND TO AUCTION AND THE TEAM WINS THAT MAKES
AFTER THREE YEARS OF TRAINING
LIKE TOY COLLECTORS
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM
YOU KNOW THE SCORE
LOOK AFTER YOURSELVES
GO HAVE A CUP OF TEA
ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SAT DOWN THERE
FIFTY ON THE TIN TOFFY
IT'S MADE MY DAY
IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE
YOU SHOULD BE BUYING THIS ONE
HE WAS THE MAIN MAN
WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO IF THEY WANT THAT SORT OF THING
AND A HALF ROUND THIS WAY
TO GET TO SCHOOL
AND THESE PEOPLE PROVIDED IT
THEY ALL CLUB TOGETHER
WE'VE GOT A NICE PLACE HERE
WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO COME INTO IT
BUT IF YOU GOT SUCH A NICE PLACE THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO COME INTO IT
MEAN IN AS MUCH AS I HAVE WORKED ALL MY LIFE
UNTIL WE GOT THERE
AND WE WE COULD NEVER ENTERTAIN ANYBODY
WHAT'S BEING DONE TO RID OUR STREETS OF THESE TERRIBLE DISEASES AND IMPROVE THE NATION'S HEALTH
WE HAVE THE CREAM OF BRITISH MEDICAL TALENT WITH US
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
I'M A PHYSICIAN
AND AS A MEDICAL MAN
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS
WHERE WAS IT COMING FROM
NOT ONE OF THE THIRTY EIGHT PEOPLE WORKING IN THIS BREWERY HAD FALLEN ILL FROM CHOLERA
FULL OF RAW SEWAGE
ALWAYS WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO FETCH THEIR WATER FROM BROAD STREET
LET'S GO OVER TO THE SURGERY AND MEET THE ESTEEMED MILITARY MEDICINE MAN
IT WAS NOT A HOTEL
DRY PLACE TO SLEEP
CLEAN HOSPITALS ARE GOING TO SAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES IN THE FUTURE AND REALLY HELP IN
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
IT'S IN THE BLOOD
MY MOTHER WAS A DOCTORRESS IN JAMAICA
MY FAMILY WERE COMPLETELY AGAINST MY NURSING AND I HAD TO
WE'RE GOING TO BE INVESTIGATING A SUBJECT WHICH HAS BEEN CLOSE TO MY HEART FOR MANY A YEAR
THIS IS THE ONE THAT'S REALLY GUARANTEED TO GET MY GOAT
BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS
TWO WORDS WHICH SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN JOINED TOGETHER
AND I AIM TO STRIKE THE HEAVIEST BLOW IN MY POWER FOR THESE POOR
YOU'VE GOT TO GET THEM WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG
FOR AS THE SAPLING HAS BEEN BENT
THIS IS A HUGE EXPECTATION OF A CHILD
AND SO THEN THEY INTRODUCED THEIR OWN FACTOR REACT
FIVE MINUTES MAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEFEAT AND VICTORY
SO HOW ABOUT SIXTY MINUTES
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
AND BUT WE LOVE IT HERE
AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE
BUT WHO WILL BE TOP DOG
LADIES IN PINK ON TRACTORS
AND IF HE HAS MORE KNOWLEDGE
OPERA TOP HATS COLLAPSE
AND THEN WHEN YOU WANT THEM TO GO
TOP HATS ARE GOOD WHEN THEY FIT ME
I WAS LED ASTRAY BY DAD'S FRIEND
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS
HOW DOES THIS WEIRD AND WONDERFUL CHINESE CONFECTION PITCH UP HERE IN NORWICH
ALL I KNOW IS THAT WITH A BIT OF NEGOTIATION
YOU FIND THEM IN VENICE
EXCEPT THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH VENICE BECAUSE IT WAS PROBABLY MADE IN MALTA
IN VALLETTA HARBOUR
FOR THE SHARP EYED AMONGST YOU
THE OTHER JOYOUS THING IS
IF YOU TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN
IT'S MADE OF SOLID SILVER
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
THE WELL CRAFTED PIECES
THESE LABELS ARE BOGUS
SO IT WANTS TICKLING UP BUT NOT MUCH
THOMAS PLANT GOT VERY
SO THAT'S A BIT OF A BLOW
IF THEY'VE GOT A DARK HOLE
ON THE BASIS OF THAT
THIS ENAMEL WORK IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO
AS IT WOULD BE IN THE IN THE DAY
THIRTY IN THE ROOM AND I'M OUT
ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS IS WHERE WE'RE AT
THAT MEANS OVERALL YOU'RE PLUS TWELVE
EVEN THOUGH YOU REALLY
WE'RE GOING TO GLAZE OVER THAT
IT'S RATHER LIKE REACHING A TOP OF A MOUNTAIN
THEY WILL FACE TWO MINUTES OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND TWO AND A HALF MINUTES ON
AND THE I DEIF IS THAT SMALL ISLAND IN THE BAY FRONT OF THE CITY OF MARSEILLES
DO GO TO OUR WEBSITE BBC
THANKS FOR WATCHING
I'D BETTER GET USED TO EVERYBODY SPOUTING ADVICE ON WHAT'S BEST FOR ME
YOU WOULDN'T FIX A CAR WITHOUT CHECKING WHAT'S UNDER THE BONNET FIRST
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US
YOU WANTED TO SEE THE WORLD
ACCORDING TO BIANCA
GO TO THE SEASIDE
I'VE GOT THREE WORDS
HIS MOTHER HAD JUST DIED
WHAT CAN YOU DO ON THAT
I REALLY HATE IT
IN DECORATIVE TERMS
AS IF HE NEEDED REMINDING
YOU WERE ALLOWED TO KEEP THE SILVER GILT
BUT COVERED IN GOLD
HE EVEN HAD THE RIGGING ON THE ROYAL YACHT GILT
HE LOVED IT SO MUCH
BUT LET'S SEE WHAT THOMAS PLANT SPENT IT ON
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT THOMAS'S NAIL BUFF
YOU WERE PLUS TWO BEFORE
YOU ARE PLUS THIRTY TWO
AND I'M SORRY I DID THAT
IF I WAS STAYING
I WOULD BE SO EXCITED ABOUT WHERE THIS COULD GO
YOU WANT TO IMPRESS MY DAD
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT
WHICH IS WHERE WE HAPPEN TO BE TODAY ANYWAY
WELL I'M I'M A CHEF
IT'S GOT BAGS OF STYLE
BUT FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
IT MAY NOT SOUND A LOT OF MONEY
SO SHOULD WE BE DOING MORE TO DEFEND OUR ISLANDS FROM THE SEA
BEHIND THE OPENING TITLES
LET'S MEET THE HORSEPOWER
YEAH SO GOING FORWARD TO
ALL THAT CHANGED
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY AND I'LL BE FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT THAT LATER IN THE PROGRAM
IT WASN'T JUST THAT ONE COLLISION
SAY I GOT OFF THE BUS
HE WORKED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS
A LOCAL CLIMBER
YOU KNOW IT WON'T BE APPROPRIATE
WHICH I USED TO DRIVE MY CAR IN TO THE DRIVEWAY AND THEN BEYOND THE ROAD
SHE WAS A REAL VICTORIAN ENTREPRENEUR OF HER TIME
BECAUSE WHEN WE FIRST HAD HIM HERE
AND HE WAS THE FIRST STOP
THE WILD SWIMMER
AND AS YOU GET IN THE WATER
AND FINDING OUT HOW AN ANCIENT WOODLAND IS HELPING INJURED TROOPS ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY
HE'LL GET STUCK
I STAYED IN A HOTEL IN LA
WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS THAT THAT OPERATION HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST DEPLOYMENT OF BRITISH MILITARY
AH BRINGING THAT LOT HOME IS QUITE A BIG JOB
ALL CARS WILL HAVE TO BE MADE LIKE THIS BUT
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S FASTER AND IT'S MORE ECONOMICAL
BUT EQUALLY FASCINATING IS WHAT THE AFGHANISTAN CAMPAIGN HAS DONE TO BRITAIN'S MILITARY
BUT IN THE OLD DAYS
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
JAGU HAS BEEN PART OF MY LIFE FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS
I'VE DONE IT MY WHOLE LIFE
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK
WELCOME TO DRAGON DEN
WHERE FIVE SELFMADE MILLIONAIRES DECIDE WHETHER TO INVEST IN THE BUSINESS DREAMS OF
BANKSY MIGHT BE THE ONLY GRAFFITI ARTIST THAT YOU OR I HAVE HEARD OF
OUR FIRST ENTREPRENEUR DAVID BROWN IS CONVINCED THERE'S REAL MONEY TO BE MADE BY BRINGING URBAN
ONE A HELLO KITTY BEDROOM
FIRST OF ALL AND SAY
BUT THE SECOND ONE
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE ME CONFIDENT
THIS IS WHAT I'M AFTER
THERE IS A SIDE OF ME THAT WOULD LOVE TO INVEST BECAUSE I CAN SEE THE POTENTIAL
OUR NATIONAL TASTE FOR COFFEE HAS GONE UP MARKET IN RECENT YEARS
BUT WE STILL SPEND OVER A BILLION POUNDS A YEAR ON THE INSTANT VARIETY
THE CONVENIENCE IS
HIGHLY VALUED AND OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEUR
THINKS SHE CAN CASH IN ON THAT
FORGET THE TEA BAG SHE WANTS TO INFUSE NEW LIFE INTO THE COFFEE BAG
BUT WITH GROUND COFFEE IN
THAT'S MY QUESTION
YOU COME ACROSS REALLY WELL
I THINK I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS RIGHT
THERE ARE NORMALLY ABOUT THREE WEEKS A YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY WITH IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR CAMPING
CHRISTIAN AND CAROLINE VAN OUTERUR ARE ALREADY SUCCESSFUL GLAMPING ENTREPRENEURS AND THEY NOW
SO IT'S VERY WELL PLACED
IN TERMS OF TOURISM
I CAN'T MAKE AN INVESTMENT
I WON'T BE INVESTING AND I'M OUT
WE WANT TO TAKE THIS BUSINESS FURTHER
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO IS
OR EVEN STAY IN CARAVANS
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF MONEY
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF PRICE
ENTREPRENEURS VINI AND BAL ALER THINK THEY HAVE SPOTTED ONE FOR A FRESH CURRY SAUCE
BOTH TRYING TO COMBINE CONVENIENCE FOR THE CONSUMER WITH A FRESH TASTE
THE CONVERSATIONS ON ALL OF TONIGHT'S PITCHES CONTINUE ON TWITTER
IT'LL BE HIGH IN THE SKY AFTER SUNSET MAKING THIS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR BRITISH OBSERVERS TO GET
THE MIGHTY JUPITER
BUT ON THE EARTH
THE EQUATOR IS USUALLY HOT AND THE AND THE POLES ARE COLD
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE TO BE SEEN AROUND THAT AREA AND I'VE PICKED OUT SOME OF MY FAVOURITE
IF YOU GO OUT AND CATCH IT EARLY
IT'S POSSIBLE TO SEE A FULL ROTATION OF THE PLANET
THAT'S ONE WHOLE DAY ON JUPITER
NOW SINCE WE WERE LAST ON AIR
SO THEY'RE BRIGHT
SO YOU CAN SEE THEM FROM A LONG DISTANCE AWAY
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
WHICH THEN EXPLODES
SPEAKING OF CELESTIAL SPECTACULARS
WE HAD HOPED BEFORE CHRISTMAS THAT COMET ISON WAS GOING TO PUT ON A GREAT SHOW FOR US BUT IT DIDN'T
BUT THE OTHER THING
BY PASSING NEAR A NEARBY GALAXY
UM LOOKING AT THE SKY IN DIFFERENT BANDS OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM GIVES YOU A VERY DIFFERENT
WHICH IS HEADING TO EUROPA SO
WHAT IF THIS MATERIAL ISN'T COMING FROM THE OCEAN
MAYBE IT'S THE ACTION OF SOMETHING HEATING UP IN JUST THE VERY TOP LAYERS
AND IT'S STILL EXCITING BECAUSE IT'S A WAY WE CAN SAMPLE THE SURFACE MATERIALS FROM OUR SPACECRAFT
EUROPA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A TANTALISING PLACE FOR US TO ONE DAY ONE DAY GO AND EXPLORE AND NOW MORE SO WITH
IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF OUR OWN MOON
IF YOU LOOK AT IT HERE ON THE SCREEN
FROZEN THEN INTO AH INTO A BODY OF OF LIQUID WATER THAT HAS RE FROZEN
THE TYPICAL THING WITHIN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM OF THE ABILITY TO SENSE WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO
AND THESE FIES AND STRIPES
WHICH ARE UNDERGOING DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF STRESS AS THE MOON GOES ROUND JUPITER
LIKE THIS OBSERVATION IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE
THINGS ARE RELAXED
YOU'RE ABLE TO EMANATE THESE PLUMES OUT OF THE SOUTH POLE
NOW THE TEAM ALSO HAVE OBSERVATIONS FROM JUST A MONTH EARLIER
SO YOU HAVE THIS SITUATION
EXTREMELY DYNAMICALLY RICH
WHERE THE PLUMES ARE ONLY EMANATING THEIR MATERIAL INTO SPACE WHEN THE THE STRESS IS AT ITS LOWEST
WHEN WE COME BACK NEXT MONTH
WILL BE LISTENING TO THE COSMOS STUDYING SOUND WAVES TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY CAN TELL US ABOUT THE
AND TO HAVE THESE DIFFERENT TRADES
EMPRESS OF BRITAIN
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
THE MAN NEXT DOOR WALK IN THE SHIPYARD
HE SAID THAT IF I WERE A SHIPBUILDER I'D HAVE NOTHING BUT UNION WORRIES AND MONEY WORRIES
DRIVE FOR PLACE TO WORK
BUT SOMETIMES IT WAS REALLY FUNNY AND
WE'VE GOT A MARKET
THE COLONIES WERE STILL GOING
SHIPS RAN BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS TO THE COLONIES
WAS FROWNED UPON
WERE REALLY RATHER BETTER
IF YOU BANGED YOUR HEAD ON A STEEL PLATE
AND WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE JUST POOR QUALITY AND THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY TOO MUCH
THE TWO PRINCIPAL ONES BEING THE BOILERMAKERS AND THE SHIPWRIGHTS
MOST OF THEM WERE INSIGNIFICANT
HE DIDN'T CAUSE ANY TROUBLE AT ALL
THE LABOUR FROM
SO IF WE DID WELL
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK IT WITH SIX PEOPLE
THE TROUBLE WAS THAT WE ARE LOCKED INTO A SYSTEM OF CONFRONTATION
AND IT WAS VERY
EVERYBODY WANTED A LAMINATED KITCHEN
BUT BECAUSE SHE'S ONE OF THE BEST
SHE CAME FROM A VERY FAMOUS SHIPYARD AS WELL
SO THAT'S WHY SHE'S SO SPECIAL
WE FELT WE WERE BETTER TO GO INTO THIS MERGER
YOU COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
BECAUSE IT WOULD PROTECT OUR EMPLOYEES
IF WE'D GONE ON OUR OWN
WE MIGHT HAVE LASTED A YEAR OR TWO
I WAS THE SEVENTH GENERATION OF SHIPBUILDERS IN OUR COMPANY
AND I FELT VERY GUILTY THAT I'D LET THE FAMILY DOWN
WE WERE RUNNING OUT OF ORDERS
WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT
WE BOAT OUTSIDE THE GATES
THAT IT BECAME BANKRUPT
AND IT DID HAVE INTEGRITY ABOUT IT
UM THERE WERE ANY NUMBER OF MEETINGS IN GLASGOW
AND I USED TO GO ALONG TO THESE MEETINGS AND HEAR PEOPLE LIKE JIMMY REID AND JIMMY E TALKING
WHICH WAS A GREAT THING
WHERE THERE BEEN FIVE YARDS
WHILE IT WAS A GREAT TRIUMPH
IT WOULD BE REDEVELOPED INTO SOMETHING ELSE
FOOD FOR SHARING
THERE ARE NOW OVER EIGHT HUNDRED BREWERIES IN THE UK AND THE PRODUCTION OF SMALL SCALE CRAFT ALE IS BIG
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF MY REALLY ANNOYING THINGS
I WANT ALL CHIPS TO MYSELF
BUT AS TAPAS KING OMAR ALLLIBOY HAS BEEN FINDING OUT
SPAIN DOESN'T HAVE THE MONOPOLY ON THIS WAY OF EATING
KOREAN CUISINE IS CAUSING A STIR AMONGST FOOD LOVERS AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE FOOD
LEAVE IT IN THE FRIDGE OR THE OVEN
HOW BLASE WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION SAY
WHEN THESE SHATTERED VASES
IT WAS ALL ABOUT IMAGE
I JUST REMEMBER ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL BIRDS
I CAN'T EVEN SAY
GROWN FUCKING MEN SINGING SONGS ABOUT WORMS AND FAIRIES
AND BRIAN WOULD COME ON
STUFF WITH STUFF IT AND WE'D PUT IT ON HIS HEAD
WE KILLED A PANDA ONCE
SO DID THE PRODUCTION VALUES
PRODUCERS BECAME JUST AS INNOVATIVE AS THEIR SUBJECTS
PHIL SPECTOR CREATED HIS WALL OF SOUND
SO I KNEW THIS POACHER WHO COULD GET ME SOME REALLY
WHICH ACTUALLY DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A SOUND
AND CHANGED THE FACE OF MUSIC FOREVER
THAT MAN WAS JUDGE DREAD
IT GAVE BIRTH TO A NEW FORM OF BIG BUCKS
WHAT TEN DAYS UNDER
WHAT FIELD IS IN
HE'S NOT COMING
I MEAN I KNOW ABOUT CONTRACTS
YEAH YOU WERE ASKED TO PLAY A PRIVATE CONCERT FOR THE QATAR ROYAL FAMILY
YOU'D THINK I WOULD DESPISE THE NEXT GENERATION OF ROCKERS WHO WERE DETERMINED TO OVERTHROW ROCK
WITH SONGS ABOUT ABORTION
ANARCHY AND BOREDOM
WHO WOULD CHANGE THE FACE OF MUSIC FOREVER
BUT IT REALLY WASN'T
I DREAMT THE FUCKING TANGERINES
MY ARM WOULD NOT GET TIRED PUNCHATWAT
BUT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO AMERICA
TO GET TO THE COLONIES
THE PASSENGER LINER COMPANIES QUICKLY REALISED THAT THE WAY TO MAKE MONEY WAS TO OFFER THE SHORTEST
THEY WERE MEANT TO DIVERT
SHELTERED FROM THE RAVAGES OF THE ATLANTIC
THE LUSITANIA WON THE BLUE RIBBAND IN NINETEEN SEVEN
A ONE STOP SHOP FOR TRAVELLERS
THE BUILDINGS SURVIVE AND THEY'RE COVERED WITH WONDERFUL DETAILS THAT REVEAL THEIR GREAT PAST
WOULD RUN DIRECTLY TO SOUTHAMPTON
IN TERMS OF OCEAN LINERS
SO THE IDEA THAT A SHIP COULD BE A GLAMOROUS PLACE IS AN ALTOGETHER NEW IDEA
AND THE NATIONS OUTDOING EACH OTHER
THE MODEL WAS THE POMPEIAN POOL HERE AT THE ROYAL AUTOMOBILE CLUB IN LONDON
HE DECIDED HE WANTED TO OPEN A CINEMA
BUT THIS WAS A SHIP THAT HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH THE INTENTION OF REGAINING THE BLUE RIBAND AND
IT WAS ABOUT ENTRANCES
KNOW IF YOU GO BY ONE
GET THEM IN ENGLAND
LIKE RIHANNA AND STUFF
BUT ALSO JUST WHEN I'VE BEEN GOING OUT TO BARS AND STUFF
AND IT BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A SORT OF PLATONIC CONVERSATION WITH ANYONE
AND I FIND IT QUITE EXHAUSTING
DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE HERE ARE USED TO IT
FOR THE MOST PART LIKE
FOUR MORE CONTENDERS PUT THEMSELVES TO THE TEST TONIGHT IN THE HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT BE CROWNED THE
WHAT HIGH SCORES
PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
UM YOU CAN COME AND HELP US CELEBRATE MUM'S GOOD NEWS
I WENT TO LOOK FOR BUT
I CAN'T CHANGE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
HOW I GOT ON
I SHALL BE HERE
TODAY IS KAT'S FIRST PROPER SCAN
AND EVERYONE'S A ZOMBIE
SHE'S NOT EXACTLY THE MOST FOCUSED WOMAN IN THE WORLD
AND THE WORK THING
ROMANCE IS NOTHING
EMPTY WORDS AND ALCOHOL
THAT'S NOT THE POINT
IT NEVER GOES INTO THE ENVELOPE
WE JUST SIT THERE
BUT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT SOME OF THE WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY ARE DOING TO STAND UP FOR
IN ANOTHER PROJECT THAT IS BEING SUPPORTED BY WOMANKIND
YOU CAN ENSURE THAT WOMEN WILL BE ABLE TO LIVE IN SAFETY WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION THROUGH THE
NOT JUST HERE IN SIERRA LEONE BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD
MANY OF THE DANCERS IN OUR TOP FIFTY ARE ABOUT FREEDOM AND FUN AND HAVING WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS
BUT IT'S NOT NOW
MY BIG NEWS THIS WEEK
WE RECEIVE THOUSANDS OF LETTERS FROM PEOPLE THAT SAY
BECAUSE CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION
WE REALLY DO LIKE SMALL
SENSIBLE LITTLE CARS
HE HAS A FIAT PANDA
WE LIKE THE WAY THAT SMALL CARS ARE EASY TO PARK AND CHEAP TO RUN BUT
WE LIKE THE WAY THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE VERY GOOD FUN TO DRIVE
THEY SAY THEY'RE BORING
FIRE A MORTAR AND STRIP AN ASSAULT RIFLE
I WAS REALLY EMBARRASSED ABOUT THAT
YOU CAN WHEELIE AS WELL
IT'S JUST PEOPLE'S OPINIONS AND
IT IS THE WETTEST YOU CAN
THEY TOLD US TO DRIVE OUR THREE ONE LITRE HATCHBACKS ALL THE WAY ACROSS UKRAINE
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING
WHERE A FRESH BATCH OF CASH HUNGRY ENTREPRENEURS ARE READY TO FACE FIVE SELFMADE MILLIONAIRES
MOST OF US HAVE HAD A BAD NIGHT'S SLEEP FROM TIME TO TIME
THEIR ANSWER INVOLVES SHEEP
I THINK AT THIS STAGE
MY NAME IS BENJAMIN MOGABEL
AND I LOVE THE NAME
WHEN YOU CAME IN HERE
PRIVATE EQUITY FOR YEARS
AND YOU DO HAVE A GREAT IDEA
ONE THING I WANT TO ADD IS I AM AN HONEST MAN
I'M USING A COMPANY
THEY'RE CREATING THE WHOLE THING
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS REJECTIONS IN DEN HISTORY IS PROBABLYRU
A RIDE ON SUITCASE FOR CHILDREN
IT DIDN'T SECURE AN INVESTMENT
BUT IT WENT ON TO BIG THINGS AND NOW YOU SEE THEM IN AIRPORTS THE WORLD OVER
I WONDER IF THE MEMORY OF THAT WILL AFFECT HOW THE DRAGONS REACT TO OUR NEXT COUPLE
APART FROM JOHN LEWIS
WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO THE OTHER PARTIES YET
COULD I SEE IT SELLING
I WAS QUITE HAPPY
SPARE A THOUGHT FOR DUNCAN BANNEINE
WHO WAS THWARTED IN HIS ATTEMPTS TO INVEST ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS
SO LET'S GET BUSY
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
EARLY PART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
FOR MAKING YOUR BREATH SMELL SWEETER
IN MY FIFTY YEARS OF WANDERING AROUND PLACES LIKE THIS
WE'VE STAYED IN DEVON AND HAVE COME TO BIS
YOU'RE NOW MINUS THIRTY FIVE
WHICH MEANS YOU ARE ONLY MINUS TWENTY FIVE
ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF DAVID ACCORDING
BUT THERE WE ARE
HAVE TELL YOU A STORY
I NEVER FORGET THERE WAS
ESPECIALLY FOR WINE
KATE IS CONVINCED IT'S AS IMPORTANT TO KNOW ABOUT WHERE OUR VINES ARE GROWN AS IT IS TO KNOW THE
IT'S JUST IT'S IT'S INSANE
WE FEEL BETTER ABOUT OUR FOOD WHEN WE KNOW WHAT'S IN IT
ON THE SOUTH COAST OF CORNWALL
HUNTS AND COOKS MOST OF THE FOOD HE EATS
REALLY LOVELY LEMON FLAVOR
WE DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT REALLY GOES INTO ARGUABLY THE ULTIMATE PROCESSED INDUSTRIAL FOOD
AND WE DO OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE WE SHOP RESPONSIBLY
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
IF YOUR FOOD IS COMING OUT OF YOUR KITCHEN
BUT I THINK IT'S A MUCH MALIGNED SAUSAGE AND ONE I ACTUALLY LOVE
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S HOMEM MADE
IT'S WINTER WARMING FOOD
WHICH JUST PROVIDES ENOUGH COVER FOR THE BIRDS TO NEST BUT DOESN'T ALLOW TOO MUCH
A VICTORIAN COOK WOULD ALWAYS BE PAID A SALARY
IT'S BEEN UNFAIRLY DEMONISED TODAY
AND THOSE PERKS WERE THINGS LIKE THE RIGHT TO SELL RABBIT SKINS
THE RIGHT TO SELL DRIPPING AT THE BACK DOOR
OR THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME
I ACTUALLY DO IT THE MUCH SIMPLER WAY
AND I THINK IT'S THE BETTER WAY
THIS IS A MINERAL COMPOUND
BUT THERE'S MORE TO BONES THAN THAT
THEY'RE ACTUALLY WHAT WE CALL A COMPOSITE MATERIAL MADE UP OF TWO VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF ELEMENT
THE FIRST ONE IS AN ORGANIC COMPOUND
BUT IF YOU TOOK A LOOK INSIDE A LIVING ANIMAL ME
SO ONE BONE IS BEING COMPRESSED
THEY HAVE VERY WEIRD FEET
THE FEMUR FROM THE RHINO IS ACTUALLY THREE TIMES STRONGER
THERE'S ALSO A MASSIVE SHAPE DIFFERENCE
AND AS A BIOLOGIST
BUT IT WILL REVEAL HOW THE EXTRAORDINARY ANATOMY OF THE HANDS HAS BROUGHT ABOUT SOME OF THE
THE ACTUAL BONE MINERAL CONTENT
INCREASES IN CLIMBERS
PARTICULARLY SMALL OBJECTS
AS THEIR DOMINANT HAND
I'M A NATURAL LEFT HANDED
DOES THAT MEAN THAT MY BRAIN IS WIRED UP IN A DIFFERENT WAY
WHAT GIVES IT ITS STRENGTH AND PHENOMENAL RANGE OF MOVEMENT
TOUCH IS ESSENTIAL TO EVERYONE
IT'S KIND OF LIKE TWO SENSES IN ONE
BUT THERE'S ONE FINAL SECRET WE'VE YET TO UNCOVER
HIDDEN BENEATH OUR FINGERTIPS ARE THE WORKINGS OF ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX AND VITAL SYSTEMS IN OUR
ALL THE LETTERS AND WORDS
WE'RE TRYING TO REPRODUCE THAT
LIKE MOST PEOPLE
AND SEEN THE INCREDIBLE NATURAL ENGINEERING INSIDE
I'VE GOT A NEW FOUND RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR THIS PART OF OUR ANATOMY
LIKE A PIECE OF SCULPTURE
YOU'VE GOT A WRISTWATCH
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF IT MADE LESS THAN A THOUSAND
YOU'VE GOT A MOBILE PHONE
BUT IN THE OLD DAYS
AND THAT'S ONE OFF NINETY
AND THEY HAVE A MASSIVE PASSION FOR MEDALS AND COINS
ALL THE VERY BEST
THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
SO THAT'S SPOT ON
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
MY GRANDMOTHER'S RECIPE FOR A YORKSHIRE PUDDING
AND MY MOTHER'S RECIPE FOR A GRAVY AND IT IS GRAVY
IT'S ALL TO DO WITH THAT FAT
BUT THEY TRIM OFF ALL THE FAT
AND WHEN YOU TASTE IT
WRAPPED LIKE THAT
WOULD LAST FOR ABOUT SORT FIVE
SEVEN DAYS IN THE FRIDGE
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THAT IT'S AFFECTING THIS FAMILY IN ANY POSITIVE
THAT'S WHAT IT IS
AND IT WAS UP TO ME TO GET YOU SOMETHING
THE DRIVER USED TO TAKE ME HOME VIA A VERY FAMOUS CHICKEN OUTLET
I USED TO HAVE A BUCKET
THIS IS WHERE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FRESH TIME
USE THAT AS THE BASIS OF THE CRUMB
YOU JUST BLITZ THE BREAD
AND BY THE THIRD DAY SHE LIKED IT
REALLY MAYBE FOR PIZZAS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
HOW THEY ARE DOING IT
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT WELL
IT TAKES THOSE THINGS
I NORMALLY LIKE IT AFTER ABOUT A DAY
BUT EVEN SOMETIMES WHEN IT'S REALLY
THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A VERY
I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC
I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT
I'VE BEEN DOING IT EVER SINCE
MAKE A SAUCE OUT OF IT
ADD IT AT THIS POINT
IF YOU ADD IT WHEN THE CREAM IS TOO WHIPPED
AH SOME OF THE PEPPERCORNS ARE GROUND
IT'S JUST LIGHTLY SPICED AGAIN WITH GARLIC AND BLACK PEPPER
HE SHOULD BE HERE WITH ME
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU
LUCY BUS GOT TO BE THE NEXT KAREN BRADY ALL TO IMPRESS YOU
I'M NOT TAKING BOBBY ANYWHERE
BUT ALSO KEPT YOUR HANDS WARM IN THE VERY
YOU WOULDN'T NORMALLY THINK OF A SALAD
SO IT'S JUST EVERYTHING IS IN QUITE A LARGE QUANTITY
SO THIS IS QUITE HANDY
IT'S THE WAY WE FIRST STARTED OUT
TONIGHT'S CONTENDERS WILL EACH MAKE THE SHORT AND VERY DAUNTING WALK TO THE BLACK CHAIR WHERE THEY
PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
IT DON'T END WELL
I JUST WANT TO KNOW SHE'S OK
I CAN'T YOU REMEMBER
AND THAT IF HE DID WELL
ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM
HE SHOULD BE HERE WITH ME
AND I'M NOT TAKING BOBBY ANYWHERE
I WANT TO PASS ON YOU SOME OF THE KNOWLEDGE WE'VE LEARNT FROM HAVING THOSE WONDERFUL OBJECTS PASS
ON MY FATHER'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY
AND THE MORE ELABORATE AND THE MORE EXPENSIVE THE BOX WAS
THE BETTER THE HOUSEHOLD THAT IT CAME FROM
SOME PEOPLE WOULD PREFER TO RESTORE IT
SO PEOPLE WILL BUY OLD ITEMS THAT ARE DAMAGED AND THEY WILL USE THEM TO REPAIR OTHER
TAKE THE IVORY KEYS AND USE THAT IN RESTORATION OF SOMETHING ELSE
THEY'RE NOT QUITE WORTH THE MONEY THAT THEY WERE
IS THAT IT DOES SPARK AN INTEREST
THEY TAKE IT HOME AND
WHETHER THEY SELL IT OR NOT
YOU KNOW AND HE WOULD HAVE COME FROM THAT GREAT AGE OF VICTORIAN INVENTION AND MONEY WHEN
WITH THE SORT OF DIVIDE OF THE UPSTAIRS AND THE DOWNSTAIRS IN THESE COUNTRY
BUT NOT PRIVATE
YOU DON'T SEE MUCH FURNITURE MADE OUT OF IT
DECANTERS AREN'T THE EASIEST THINGS TO SELL ANY MORE
THERE ARE COLLECTORS
PRICES ARE PRETTY LOW
AH YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING PRETTY SPECIAL
THESE WERE A NICE DECENT PAIR IN THEIR FITTED CASE
IF YOU TOOK THOSE PAIR OF DECANTERS OUT OF THAT COROMANDEL BOX
THE VALUE WAS AS A PARCEL
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN A COMPANY OWNER OR A POLITICIAN OR A MILITARY MAN OR A SEMI
YOU'D HAVE NEVER POLISHED IT YOURSELF
WHICH I THINK WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR SOMETHING
YOU NEVER EVER WANT TO SEE DAMAGE
IT'S THE WRINKLES ON ITS FACE YOU KNOW
AND THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT YOU HERE TO LANHYDROCK HOUSE SET IN NINE HUNDRED ACRES OF PARKLAND ON THE RIVER FOY
BUT WITH ALL THE TRAPPINGS AND THE ATMOSPHERE
CHILDREN AND ADULTS DIDN'T MIX
I'M SURE ALL HOUSES WANT TO SIGN LIKE THAT BUT
BUT CERTAIN PEOPLE PICKED UP ON ROBERT KERR'S IDEALS
BEING HIGH ANGLICAN
NOW THAT IS SUCH A HARSH WORD
TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT BECAUSE
A BOOK BY ROBERT KERR CALLED THE GENTLEMAN'S HOUSE
THEY HAD THEIR OWN ACCOMMODATION BUT
BUT COMPARED TO THE OPULENCE OF THE MAIN HOUSE
THE PULLEY SYSTEM INVOLVED
VERY MODERN TILING FOR ITS DAY
WHAT WOULD IT BE
ALMOST LIKE DOWNTON ABBEY
IT'S ALL THERE FOR YOU
I CAN REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY
IT WAS JUST A LOVELY
CHANCES ARE YOU WILL
THIRD HAND AND FOURTH HAND AND MANY ARE PAST THEIR BEST
AND THEY END UP GETTING THROWN AWAY
WHAT ARE PEOPLE LIKE
YOU MAY HAVE PICKED THINGS UP IN AN AUCTION ROOM
STILL VERY MUCH THE CASE YES
ALL THESE THINGS
DON'T GO AND GET YOUR STUFF CLEANED UP AND TARTED UP FOR SALE
LEAVE THEM IN THEIR ORIGINAL CONDITION
SO THE BUYING
BUT IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO FIND THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCARDED BY SOME
AND FOUND IT ON THE FLOOR
AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT MAKE FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED
I SEEM TO REMEMBER
BECAUSE PAUL GOT EXCITED
THESE THINGS WERE IN BEAUTIFUL CONDITION
THAT'S A GOOD THING
YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN THINGS OR YOU'VE INHERITED THINGS
IT'S NOW SITTING ON OUR PATIO AS A PATIO TABLE
WHAT ARE PEOPLE LIKE
I THINK IT MADE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
WE'D LIKE TO COME ALONG
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT BEFORE I WENT THERE
BUT ADAM INFORMED ME OF THAT
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUT
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME
AND BUT THE REAL SECRET ON TODAY'S SHOW IS STAY ALERT AND DON'T BE AFRAID TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY
AND DON'T ASSUME IF SOMETHING'S BEEN THROWN AWAY THAT IT'S RUBBISH
THIS WHITE WHALE IS TRULY A MASTER OF ITS WHITE WORLD
HUNTING DOWN IN THE DEPTHS IN THE DARKEST OCEAN IN THE WORLD
BECAUSE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
WE ASKED COUNTRY FILE VIEWERS FOR SUGGESTIONS OF WHERE WE SHOULD TAKE THE PROGRAMME
AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE EMAILS MENTIONED PORTLAND BILL
HOW EASILY THEY START FIRES
SHOULD THEY BE BANNED
QUARRYING HAS BEEN AS MUCH A PART OF THIS LANDSCAPE AS THE STONE ITSELF
BUT IT IS THE QUALITY OF THE PORTLAND STONE
UM VERY WELL KNOWN
THEY CAN BE EATEN
I'M WONDERING WHAT MORE EVIDENCE YOU NEED THAN THAT TO SAY
SO INNOCENTLY RELEASED BY CHILDREN
WHERE IT'S AN EVEN HOTTER TOPIC
ONCE THEY COME DOWN TO EARTH
AND YOU'D BE SURPRISED WHAT'S NUMBER ONE
THE NUMBER ONE MOST FAVOURITE PET IN THE UK I HAVE LURKING IN THE CORNER OF MY KITCHEN
AND I WANT MY ANIMALS TO BE HEALTHY
SAW AN OPPORTUNITY THERE TO KIND OF CREATE SOME FOOD
THERE ARE SOME FOODS THAT ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS
THAT'S ALMOST IT FOR THIS WEEK
THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR SUGGESTIONS
FOUR MINUTES AND FIFTY EIGHT SECONDS INTO YOUR FILM
WE MUST NOW FIND OUT HOW FAST THESE CARS GO ROUND OUR TRACK AND THAT
BUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING AND YOU EVER COME TO ENGLAND
I WOULD LIKE TO BUY YOU A BEER
YOU WERE AT ONE END PAXMAN WAS AT THE OTHER
IS WHETHER HE HAD AN IPHONE CHARGER
THEN YOUR THIRD OPTION
WHICH IS THE BEST ONE
SAME STORY IF YOU WANT A CAR THAT'S ECONOMICAL OR CHEAP
OR HAS A BIG BOOT
BUT WHAT IF YOU'RE A MASSIVE SHOW OFF AND YOUR MAIN REQUIREMENT IS FOR A CAR THAT MAKES YOU STAND
WHICH IS A TROUSER TROUBLING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND
FORTY TWO MILLION QUID FOR A FRANCIS BACON PAINTING
BUT HE CAN'T DRIVE
COME OVER HERE
AS I SHALL NOW DEMONSTRATE WITH THIS BIT OF FILM
FROM SAY TEN TO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
HARD ON THE BRAKE
TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE BRAKE
WHERE BUDDING ENTREPRENEURS GET THE CHANCE TO PITCH THEIR INVENTIONS AND IDEAS TO FIVE SELF
SOME WILL EARN LIFE CHANGING REWARDS
FIRST UP TONIGHT AN ENTREPRENEUR WHO THINKS HE HAS THE POWER TO ELECTRIFY THE DEN WITH A PRODUCT
BUT BEING ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY DOESN'T ALWAYS GUARANTEE THE GREEN STUFF FROM THE DRAGONS
ANYONE CAN DO IT
SO SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE HAD WAS THAT
DON' KNOW IT'S IT'S VERY SIMPLE
AND THEN MAYBE YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE OF MAKING IT
I'M GOING TO WISH YOU ALL THE VERY BEST OF LUCK
SOME BANDWIDTH IN TERMS OF
IF I SAID TO YOU I'LL GIVE YOU FIFTY
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BRING TO THE PARTY
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS CORRECT
I DON'T HAVE TO WATCH THAT CHILD
SELLING PEOPLE THINGS
FORMER ROYAL MARINE SIMON WEATHERALL IS NEXT INTO THE DEN
IS THE ATTACHMENT
IT'S A SUITCASE
IT'S PACKED WITH ALL THE COMPONENTS NEEDED TO KEEP THE KIDS OCCUPIED
SPOTTING AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE THE OTHERS SAW NONE
NOW THEY HAVE TO PROVE IT CAN PAY TO STICK YOUR NECK OUT
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OWN VIEW
ALL WE KNOW AT THIS STAGE
VERY SORE TO TOUCH
SO THAT MEANS HE DOESN'T HAVE SEPTIC ARTHRITIS
IN THE CRIMEAN WAR
FOR OUR TEAMS OVER AT THE AUCTION IS
ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND THEIR WAY
WHICH MEANS YOU ARE SUCH GOOD WINNERS
IF IT WAS THERE TO WARD OFF EVIL SPIRITS
SECOND A MAN WHO WOULD DO HIS BIT TO ENSURE THAT THE NEW CENTURY WAS THE
AND SHE SPOKE PLAINLY
SHE TALKED OF WHOLESALE CRUELTY
BACK DOWN IN LONDON
THE BRITISH EMPIRE STILL STOOD AS TALL
EVERYBODY WHO WENT IN
PUBLISHED IN NINETY ONE AND CALLED SIMPLY POVERTY
IT SET THINKING BRITAIN ALIGHT
BUT WITH A COMPLETELY STRAIGHT
AND THEN SHE CHOSE A SONG THEIR DAUGHTERS WOULD HAVE KNOWN
TENNYSON'S COME INTO THE GARDEN
HIS DELICATE APPEARANCE
ALMOST UNABLE TO CONTAIN HIS ENERGY AND AMBITION
STRIKINGLY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN
WHEN A DOG BITES A MAN
THE DAILY MAIL WAS A REALLY BIG
I WAS THERE REPORTING
WHEN HE GOT BACK HOME TO LONDON
ROLLS DRAGGED HIS BUSINESS PARTNER OUT OF BED AND TOLD HIM
WORKING CLASS ENGINEER
PEOPLE WATCHING THOUGHT HE WAS COMING IN A BIT TOO FAST
THEN THERE WAS A SICKENING CRACK
PART OF THE AIRCRAFT FELL OFF
WITH NORTHERN ENGINEERING GRIT AND GENIUS
WE'VE GOT WHAT WE WANTED
THEY WERE CONVICTED AND OFFERED THE CHOICE OF PRISON OR A FINE
AND THEY CHOSE PRISON
THOUSANDS OF YEARS
BASIC MEANS WHEN YOU THROW IT IN THE OVEN
IF YOU CAN STILL TASTE THE CHILI
THEN YOU ADD MORE WATER
MEANS YOU NEED FIVE
A COUPLE OF PINPRICKS
AND PUT IT INTO THE COOKING HOLE
AND BEFORE YOU SERVE UP
THERE YOU GET NOT ALL OF THE HEAT OF IT
LITERALLY TASTING SOMEBODY IN THE PAST'S EXPERIENCE
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE THIS STRANGE POSITION AS LEFTOVER DISHES
FOR SOME REASON
THEY WILL USE THIS STUFF
THEY WON'T USE THE DRIED YEAST
FOUND IN AN ANCIENT GREEK BATH
LONG BLONDE HAIR
THERE'S THE RECESSION
YOUR OFFICE IS BETTER EQUIPPED THAN MINE
THIS IS VERY SERIOUS
AND WHY DIDN'T HE TAKE IT WITH HIM
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING IS RADICALLY WRONG
WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS
YOU CAN BE MY WIFE
SHOULD CAPTAIN PEACOCK'S JOB BECOME VACANT
IT'S MADE MY MIND UP FOR ME I'M GOING TO KNOCK YOUR WAGES DOWN BY TEN
WHAT WILL THEY SAY ABOUT US IN THE TRADE
THIRTY IN THE MORNING
AS WELL AS BARLEY
OUR FRIDGES AND CUPBOARDS ARE FULL OF EXCITING INGREDIENTS LIKE THIS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
FOR YEARS WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE FURTHER OUR FOOD TRAVELS THE WORSE IT IS FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT
BUT STEFAN GATES THINKS WE HAVE GOT THE WRONG END OF THE STICK
I DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE ANYONE FROM BUYING LOCALLY
YOU CAN HAVE DELICIOUS BRITISH STRAWBERRIES IN JANUARY AND RASPBERRIES IN FEBRUARY
I'M GOING TO LET YOU INTO A SECRET HOW I PRESERVE FRUIT AND TURN IT INTO ONE OF MY FAVOURITE
WAY OUTWEIGHS ALL THE TOMATOES AND POTATOES I GET
AGAINST THAT CREAMY
WE HAD TO THINK CREATIVELY ABOUT HOW WE KEPT OUR FOOD
PRESERVING CAN INFUSE INGREDIENTS WITH EXCITING NEW TASTES AND TEXTURES
THEY WILL HAVE KNOWN OR WORKED WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS DIED TAKING THE STUFF
THEY LOVE A DEATH
THIS WAS MAINLINING HEROIN
AH YOU'D BE HAVING A NICE CHAT WITH SOMEONE
WHEN I WENT TO PARTIES
WHILST ACROSS THE WORLD THEY'RE CAUSING HAVOC WITH THEIR AGGRESSIVE FOREIGN POLICY
USUALLY MET HIM BEFORE HE WAS FAMOUS
WHICH IS WHY HE'S STILL GOT FANS AND A CAREER
INSTEAD OF THE WINDOW AND THE HP ALL IN ONE COLOUR COPY
HE PLAYED KEYBOARDS ON HEATHCLIFF
LET ME IN YOUR WINDOW
HIS WIFE WAS SHAGGING MIKE BATT
BRIAN SENT ME TO CAMBODIA TO
I WAS NEVER REALLY ENAMOURED WITH ROCK MUSIC
WHICH NO ONE ELSE IS INTERESTED IN
THEY STUFF CHEESE UP THE PRISONERS' NOSES AND PLAY BLUR SONGS TO THEM ALL DAY TO BREAK THEIR SPIRIT
WITH REMARKABLE SUCCESS
AND THEY ARE STUCK ALONE IN GIANT STATELY HOMES THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO HEAT
WHAT DO THEY DO
THOSE WITH MONEY EMBARK ON RIDICULOUS HOBBIES
THEY'VE GIVEN ALL THEIR MONEY TO A BLOKE CALLED BERNIE
YOU'RE JUST AS LIKELY TO SEE RECORDING ARTISTS LIKE ME ON LATER WITH JULES AS YOU ARE TODAY
AND THEY ARE MY BREAD AND CAVIAR
EXPOSING THEMSELVES TO THE BULL PIT THAT IS THE NEWSROOM
AND THE TEAM THAT MAKES THE MOST PROFIT WINS
WITH EVERYTHING TO GO FOR
I USED TO HAVE A REALLY COOL BEDROOM WITH THE DUVET
DON'T TELL HER WHICH ONE
LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
OR ARE THEY THE ORANGE TEAM
ONE OR TWO IDEAS
NO MOTH AND NO WOODWORM WILL ENDURE THE CAMPHOR OR THE CEDAR
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
YOU'RE MINUS TWENTY
DRIED ROSE PETALS
WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE
WE'VE GOT THE MINT
I THINK OF WINTER
WHO TAUGHT ME HOW TO COOK
SHE WAS THE ONE THAT SORT OF STARTED THE BALL ROLLING WITH THIS STEAM SPONGE PUDDING AND SHE USED
BUT NOT WITH THIS CREW
I FEEL LIKE A CAT WHO HAS USED UP EIGHT OF ITS NINE LIVES
I WILL TELL YOU
IT'S NOT GOING TO LOOK ANY DIFFERENT TO ANY ESTATE ANYWHERE ACROSS THE COUNTRY
OR MITIGATION PROPOSALS
IT DOES WHATEVER IT HAS TO DO
THEY GET THE FINAL SAY
WE CAN WIDEN THE SPECTRUM OF DESIGN
TO BE QUITE HONEST
WHO HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT
IS THIS THE RIGHT THING TO DO
ISN'T THERE OTHER POWERS
WHERE WERE THE COUNCIL
WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING
IF MEMBERS VOTE AGAINST IT
THAT'S THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
AND AS A BIOLOGIST
I THINK THAT TO TRULY UNDERSTAND OUR HANDS AND FEET
BUT IT WILL REVEAL HOW THIS EXTRAORDINARY PART OF OUR ANATOMY HAS ALLOWED US TO STAND AND
HOW FAST WE RUN
HOW HIGH WE JUMP
FOR SOME ANIMALS
BUT IN THIS CASE
WHEN THE ELEPHANT MOVES AROUND
ITS FOOT IS ACTUALLY IN THIS POSITION
AND SO NOT SURPRISINGLY
IT'S A BLUEPRINT THAT EVOLUTION HAS ADAPTED IN COUNTLESS WAYS TO ALLOW DIFFERENT ANIMALS TO
TO ME AS A BIOLOGIST
WHEN I WAS FIVE
MAKE SURE THEY'RE JUST IN THE RIGHT POSITION
I DID GYMNASTICS
WHICH REALLY TELLS YOU THE ORIENTATION OF ALL THE BUILDINGS AND THOSE VERTICAL LINES AROUND YOU
SOME MUSCLES PROVIDE THE BRAIN WITH INFORMATION
BUT THERE ARE OCCASIONS WHEN THIS COMMUNICATION BREAKS DOWN
AND THAT WAS AFFECTING YOUR BALANCE
I'VE BEEN ASTONISHED BY THE COMPLEX INTERPLAY BETWEEN ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE FOOT COMING
I AM SO SICK OF HEARING ABOUT IT
WE WOULDN'T MAKE ANY MONEY
LIFE IS NOT ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE
I WAS FINE WITH THE COW'S I STINK
IT WAS ME BLOODY FAMILY I COULDN'T STAND
FRONT AND BACK GARDENS
I'VE HAD SECOND THOUGHTS AND THAT'S A LOAD OF BOLLOCKS
BRICKS AND MORTAR
THIS IS OUR OWN
I HAD TO PUT A DEPOSIT DOWN
QUALIFICATIONS AREN'T EVERYTHING
AT THIS MOMENT SHE IS PROBABLY TRAMPING ACROSS ALOED FIELD
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO DO
FOUR SQUARE METRES
I CAME UP AGAINST ISSUES HERE THAT I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE DEALT WITH PREVIOUSLY
YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS
THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY ISSUE ABOUT OVERLOOKING AND OVERBEARING
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD MATTER WHAT RESTAURANT WOULD GO IN THERE
WHAT THEY WOULD DO TO IT
WE'VE SEEN THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN
AND SHE DIDN'T DO THAT
YOU CANNOT DO THAT
WE'VE GOT A BALLOONIA CONTAINING FRANKIE PARSON'S FINAL BREATH
I'D SAY THE ONLY FAIR WAY IS EQUAL SHARES
WHEN THE INEVITABLE HAPPENS
PRESS WENT MAD FOR IT
IF WE COULD SELL THE FIRST ONE TO A PRIVATE BIDDER
NO PUBLIC AUCTION
WHEN HE WENT TO VISIT HIM AND
THE AIRCRAFT CAME INTO THE POSITION THAT WE WEAR
EVERYTHING WAS IN A PREPARATORY STATE
SO WHAT WE TEND TO DO IS
THEY WON'T HAVE GOT AWAY WITH WHAT'S HAPPENED UP THERE
I DID SOME IMAX MOVIES
I LOVE ALL THIS STAR STRUCK STUFF
BECAUSE WE'VE COME TO BOURNE MILL ANTIQUES CENTRE OUTSIDE FARNHAM
WE MET WHEN WE WERE FIRST PUT TOGETHER ONE MONDAY MORNING IN A THEATRE
I'VE BEEN AN ACTRESS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
I WAS VERY STRICT WITH JIMMY
SHE'S THE CREATIVE
SHE'S THE WRITER
NO IT'S AH IT'S A GOOD PARTNERSHIP
I THINK WE'LL HAVE A BIT OF A MOMENT
I THINK AT AUCTION THAT MIGHT MAKE
BUT IT'S ALSO MARKED AT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
BECAUSE I CAN SEE VAL OVER HERE
AND WE'RE BACK HERE WHERE WE STARTED
IT'S WHAT'S KNOWN AS
YOU MAY HAVE PICKED UP
WHICH IS YOUR FAVOURITE PIECE
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT
PURE WATER GOING ALL THE TIME
AND THE MORE TIDE
THAT MEANS IT'S RARE
SOUNDS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD
WHEN I WAS ABOUT SORT OF TWELVE YEARS OLD
THE SAME INGREDIENTS
BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE THE BEST FOR THIS STEAK
WE ARE A QUARTET
I WILL PLAY THE PIANO
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
IT'S ONE THING TO CATCH CRABS
SO FULL STEAM AHEAD
AND SO MY MUM HAD THE BEST IDEA IN THE WORLD
I'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR TWO YEARS NOW
BUT I STARTED FLOWERANGING WHEN I WAS ELEVEN
SO I'VE DONE A LOT OF TV ANIMATION FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT BROADCASTERS
WHICH IT HAS A TENDENCY TO DO
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
WHICH IS WHAT'S SO FUN
THE SIXTY MINUTES ARE UP
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
PEOPLE LIKE ARCHIBALD KNOX
HIGH ROAD AUCTIONS
I THINK THEY'VE DONE QUITE WELL
ON CHISWICK HIGH STREET
WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO LEAVE
I MUST TALK YOU ALONE
THEY WENT INTO A CAFE
I AM PERFECTLY DECENT
YOU ERODE AREAS THAT PEOPLE USE FOR LEISURE
THIS TIME FOR AND FOR CATS TO BE BOARDED ONLY
BUT THE FACT IS
WHAT DOES THIS BRING TO THE AREA
AND ON THE OTHER AVENUE
THEY HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE TO US
WITHOUT ANY DOGS
THERE'S NO NOISE ISSUE OR NOT MUCH OF A NOISE ISSUE AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED
I THINK IT'S BSC TWELVE
WE WANT TO DEVELOP OUR YOUTH MINISTRY AND TAKE ON FULL TIME STAFF
AND FOR THE COUNCIL TO WANT TO HAVE TO CONTROL ME AND MY BUSINESS IS JUST NOT TENABLE
CATS ARE SMELLY
CAT FACES IS VERY
AND IT WAS IT FELT VERY MUCH CLOAK AND DAGGER
AND IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT
FOR THE FIRST TIME REALLY
THAT NO MATTER HOW DREADFUL THE ALIENS WERE
GET AWAY FROM ME
THIS IS ONE OF THE SEMIFINALS
IT IS THE SEMIFINALS
SO LET'S GET ON WITH IT
THANKS FOR WATCHING
I'VE SEEN IT IN NEWSPAPER CUTTINGS AND THIS KIND OF THING
THAT YOU ARE YOURSELF A GREAT EXPERT ON CRIME
JUST AS IN A DREAM
I DON'T WANT TO ASK YOU ANY OF THE QUESTIONS I'M SURE HAVE BORED YOU OVER THE YEARS
WHAT INTERESTS ME
WHY ARE YOU WALKING LIKE THAT
YOU CAN HAVE AN ORIGINAL IDEA
AND YOU END UP WITH SAY A HUNDRED PAGES
BRING IT IN WHEN IT'S NECESSARY
I WANTED TO KNOW
AS I WAS SCARED STIFF BY PSYCHO
YOU SEEM TO HAVE A VERY NICE SENSE OF HUMOUR
WHICH HAS ECHOED DOWN THE YEARS
IT WOULD BE OBJECTIVE
I MADE A PICTURE
ONCE YOU'VE REACHED THAT POINT
ON BEHALF OF THIS COLLECTIVE AUDIENCE
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK OUT BECAUSE STORING THIS SCENE UP AND HAVING THE PLEASURE OF
I WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO DO IT
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
TAKE MY DOG FOR A WALK
WITH ITS NECKS AND NIBBLES AND WHAT NOT SORTED OUT
WHAT MIGHT YOU BUY IT FOR
GO TAKE TO THE COUNTER
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING TO A PLACE CALLED THE VINE
AND WHAT THE YOUNG BLADES DID WAS TO ABSORB ALL THE ARCHITECTURAL DETAIL THAT THEY
PEOPLE DO LIKE THEM FOR NOVELTIES BUT
SO JONATHAN PROUD BE PLEASED WITH THAT
THE BIG THING IS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MY FAMILY AREN'T INTERESTED
ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WORKFORCE IN BRITAIN WAS EMPLOYED IN AGRICULTURE
DESTROYING MANY MILLS AND FARM MACHINERY IN
THE WORKERS HAD NO VOTING RIGHTS AND THEIR FRUSTRATIONS SOON TURNED TO VIOLENCE
FEARFUL OF MORE UNREST
DECIDED THEY WANTED THE TRADE UNIONS CRUSHED
YOU'RE COMPLETELY INNOCENT
GOING ABOUT YOUR DAILY BUSINESS
EXPECTING TO SEE YOUR LOVED ONES
EVEN BEFORE IT BEGAN
AND CAN STILL BE FELT TODAY
ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WAS ABOLISHED
BUT THE ROOTS OF THE FAIR AND JUST LEGAL PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TODAY CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THESE
THE STORY OF THE TO PUDDLE MARTYRS STILL PROVIDES INSPIRATION TODAY FOR MANY WORKING PEOPLE
IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
WHICH IS SOUTH OF DORCHESTER
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MY TOUR
THE AIR PRESSURE WAS CORRECT
SO ANY SECOND NOW
THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY
I'M THINKING FIVE HUNDRED
THE AUCTION IS STILL GOING ON
THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME
ONLY TROUBLE WAS
WHEN I TOOK THAT WATCH OUT
I WOULD HAVE SOLD MY SOUL TO THE DEVIL FOR A DRINK
YOU GET ONE OF US INSIDE A DUMMY LOG
THAT MEANS HAUL ME UP
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU
I MUST SAY HOW HAPPY WE ARE TO BE APPEARING ONCE AGAIN ON TELEVISION
IF YOU'VE ENJOYED IT
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING
BECAUSE YOU HELPED ME
LET ME SPEAK TO HIM AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON
NIGEL WAS THERE
REAL ANIMAL ODDITIES
I COULD TALK ABOUT THIS BIRD ALL DAY LONG
BUT I THINK IT'D BE MUCH BETTER IF WE SHOWED YOU HIM IN ACTION
I DON'T CARE HOW GOOD IT IS
OH VERY GOOD SARDINE
IT LOST CONTROL
THE FASTER YOU GO
MEANS HANDING THEM OVER TO OUR TAME RACING DRIVER
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
WILL HE MAKE IT
THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE ADDRESSED THIS PROBLEM BY MAKING A PUBLIC INFORMATION FILM
THEY STEP OFF THE CURB
IT MAKES EVERYBODY HAPPY AND GOOEY WITH EVERYBODY ELSE
NOW IT IS TIME TO PUT A STAR IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR
AND WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING INCREDIBLE
BECAUSE FOR THE NEXT FEW MINUTES
AND THE TRUNK WOULD FILL UP WITH WATER
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET LAST
THE MIGHTY NISSAN GTR WAS ALMOST HALF A MINUTE SLOWER
WELL MCLAREN ARE SAYING IT HAS GONE ROUND IN UNDER SEVEN MINUTES
BECAUSE LATER ON IN THE YEAR
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A SPECIAL TOP GEAR PROGRAMME
WE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT IT TOGETHER JUNE
THE THREE OF US ARE TOLD TO BUILD A BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI
WE HAVE TO GET THERE
WHERE PROMISING ENTREPRENEURS PITCH TO FIVE MULTIMILLIONAIRE INVESTORS
HOPING TO GET THE CASH THEY NEED TO REALIZE THEIR BUSINESS AMBITIONS
DISCOVERED ALMOST BY ACCIDENT
THE POST IT NOTE IS SURELY ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL STATIONARY PRODUCTS EVER
AND OUR FIRST ENTREPRENEUR
THAT'S BASICALLY IT YEAH
THAT I WANT TO INVEST IN
GIVEN GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US AT THE MOMENT
WE'VE HAD TO TAKE WHAT'VE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO US WITHIN THIS ELEVEN WEEKS AND THE FUTURE ORDERS THAT WE'VE NOW
PRICE COMPARISON SITES ARE PART OF THE FURNITURE OF THE INTERNET THESE DAYS AND CERTAINLY DOMINATE
SITTING HERE AND ONLY ASKING FOR A HUNDRED
WHEN I GO AND GET MIC DONE
STILL NO INVESTMENTS AND ONLY ONE ENTREPRENEUR LEFT JAMES ROEL FROM SOUTH LONDON WITH HIS
YOU KNOW AS I'M SITTING HERE
I KIND OF THINK THAT YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THOSE THINGS AND SOMETIMES THAT MIGHT COST A BIT MORE
THIS IS GOLD DUST
I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE
A SERIES WHICH HAS SHOWN THE DRAGONS HAVE LOST NONE OF THEIR APPETITE TO BACK THE BEST BUSINESS
NOW IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN AN INVESTMENT WHEN THE DEN NEXT OPENS
DO GET IN TOUCH VIA THE WEBSITE
AND HOPE TO SEE YOU HERE NEXT TIME
WITH THREE HUNDRED POUNDS AND ONE HOUR TO FIND THREE OBJECTS
I WAS TAKING A LOT A LOT OF PICTURES
I LIKE TO KEEP FIGURES ROUND
LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
WHERE IS TEAK USED
FIFTY POUND UP THE ROAD THERE IN NORWICH
INFLATE THE BELLOWS
ON THAT HAPPY NOTE
WHY DON'T WE FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT CAROLINE'S GOWN
I DON'T LIKE IT
IF THERE IS A DARK HOLE
WHICH IS PERFECT
FORTY EIGHT POUNDS I DO HAVE ON COMMISSION
FROM MARSHES WHICH WERE
LATER IN THE CAMPAIGN
A COMMANDER TOLD HENRY THAT HIS MEN WERE SIMPLY FILLING THEIR BOTTLES WITH THE LOCAL WINE
STRANDED IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
MARCHING IN THE DRIVING RAIN
THE ENGLISH REPAIRED THEM USING TIMBER RIPPED FROM NEARBY HOUSES
AND BY NIGHTFALL
THEY STAYED RIGHT UP AT THEIR END OF THE FIELD
THE FIRST GREAT BLOCK OF FRENCH MEN AT ARMS
BOUNDING IN FROM THE FLANKS
WITH KNIGHTS SIMPLY BEING CRUSHED TO DEATH IN THE
SO IF YOU SCRAPE OUT THE SEEDS
AND YOU WANT TO USE THE LEFTOVER PODS
IT'S ON THE SHELF
TO MANUFACTURE THE FLOUR THEY WANT TO MARKET
ALMOST COOKED NOW
AT THE SAME TIME
THE WHITES VERY FRESH
I LOVE USING THE EGGS FOR BAKING OR JUST ON THEIR OWN
THE DRINK IS QUITE HARMLESS
ON THE OTHER END
WHEN THEY ARRIVE
WHERE I SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE
HOWEVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE WEEKS
THE TEAM WITH THE MOST BALLS IN THE BASKET WINS THE GAME
ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR THE BETTER
WITH ONE APIECE
ONE DOG AT A TIME
BUT IF YOU WANT TO TAKE PART IN THE FUN AND GAMES
THERE'S NO REAL REASON FOR THAT
A LOT OF IT IS HOLLOW
THAT MAY BE A POLITICS ANSWER
I'D RATHER A GREATER SPREAD OF THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY FELT THE BENEFIT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
AFTER THE GREAT FIRE THEY
WHICH IS TO SAY
AND THEY STARTED TO COME
AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO COME HERE AS WELL
AND THE CHINESE AND MALAYSIANS
THE SIBLINGS PERHAPS THE SON OR DAUGHTER
WHICH IS A LOT OF MONEY AS A CAPITAL SUM
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
SO IT IS A NET IMPROVEMENT IN LONDON'S HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE
I DARE SAY IN THIRTY YEARS' TIME
THE NEW ESTATE WILL SEEM JUST LIKE PART OF THE FABRIC OF THE PLACE
SO I DECIDED TO LOOK IN WALROOMOW AND GOING THAT LITTLE BIT FURTHER OUT
I MANAGED TO BUY A ONE BEDROOM FLAT
THEY'RE NOT WORTH AS MUCH AS NEW HOMES
OTHERS COMING FROM OVERSEAS
SHARED OWNERSHIP HOMES
NOW I SHOW YOU THIS NOT TO IMPRESS YOU WITH THE MIRACLE BY WHICH THE SYSTEM COPES WITH SO MANY
WHEREVER YOU GO IN LONDON
EVEN THE ODDEST OF PLACES
NOW IT WON'T ESCAPE YOUR ATTENTION THAT EVERY POUND SPENT IN LONDON CAN'T BE SPENT ELSEWHERE
FOR THEM IT'S NOT A CHOICE BETWEEN LONDON AND MANCHESTER OR LONDON AND SHEFFIELD
THEY'RE LOOKING INTERNATIONALLY AT A RANGE OF CITIES
AND IF WE DON'T GET IT IN LONDON
LARGE SCALE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS
FALLING APART DRESSES
BUT YOU HAVEN'T JUST WRITTEN MANUALS FOR THESE CHARACTERS
WE'VE BECOME COMPLACENT
I'M AFRAID TO SAY
PLEASE MAY I HAVE IT
WE'RE HOPING THAT
IT WAS CAST IN LOUGHBOROUGH IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR
IT'S MADE OF BELL METAL
WHICH IS AN ALLOY OF COPPER AND TIN
LET'S HOPE TODAY
OVER AT THE AUCTION
COULD YOU JUST HELP ME
YOU GAVE ANITA MANNING ONE SIXTY
THESE CHAPS ARE BOTH WRITERS
WE DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT IS MINUS EIGHTY
THAT'S ALL FROM US FOR TODAY
RATHER THAN LOVED
A FEW DROPS OF WATER
THOSE FELLOWS DESERVE BONAPARTE
THAT WAS JUST A FEW MILES DOWN THIS ROAD
A FEW MONTHS AGO
PUT IN FRONT OF A FIRING SQUAD AND SHOT
YOU MAY REMEMBER
A FITTING TRIBUTE TO A FINE AND MUCH LOVED
YOU ARE NOT COMING TO PAY RESPECTS TO MY SACRED MEMORY IN YOUR CURLERS
IT WILL BE READY FOR TESTING WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS
HE HASIES WIFE
YOUR WONDERFUL SMILE DRIVES ME OUT OF MY WITS
BITE ON A CLOVE OF GARLIC FOR THE PAIN
HE IS A FAST WORKER
HE POINTS HIS FINGER AT ME AND HE SAYS
I DON'T ACTUALLY RECOGNISE THE WARNING SIGNS ANYMORE
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN WATCHING
EACH AND EVERY TEXT IS REALLY APPRECIATED
THEY'LL BE STARTING THEIR RUN WITH FIFTEEN SECONDS ALREADY ADDED TO THE CLOCK
THEY WILL ONLY GET TWO ATTEMPTS AT EACH OBSTACLE
RELIEF THANKS TO ALL OUR DOGS AND THE OWNERS FOR TAKING PART
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
MAYBE THEY WILL BE THERE FOR A FEW DECADES
AND THEN ANOTHER THREE FOOT AT ITS MAXIMUM HEIGHT WITH THE FENCE
WHICH WAS A COMMUNITY
FAMILY BASED AREA
HIM BEING INVOLVED ISN'T A MATERIAL PLANNING CONSIDERATION
IT MAY NOT REFER TO PLANNING POLICY
RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY
THEY HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE VERY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE CERTAINLY
BUT WERE WE CONSIDERED
THEY WERE MASSIVE
YOU'VE GOT THESE BIG WINGS
YOU NEED SOMEWHERE TO ATTACH THESE THINGS TO
IT'S INCREDIBLY HEAVY
IT'S VERY DENSE
THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT
BECAUSE MOST BIRDS FLY
LET'S GET TO WORK ON HAIR
AND BEING REALLY APPREHENSIVE TO START
SO BEFORE OUR NEXT CHALLENGE
BUT AFTER THE COMMENTS FROM THE JUDGES
YOUR ANGLE IS PERFECT
IT'S NOT ABOUT PRECISION AT THE MOMENT
WHERE DID MIAMI COME FROM
AND I PUT THE PLAIT AROUND IT
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTOOD
IT'S HER PROBLEM
SO WHEN'S YOUR NEXT PAINTING
FROM SAIGON EXPRESS
YOU'VE GOT A BABY AND A BOYFRIEND BUT YOU'RE STILL LIVING WITH YOUR FATHER
HOW ARE YOU TODAY
BUT THOSE PATIENTS WERE SUFFERING BADLY
BUT IT ALSO FORCED PEOPLE TO CONFRONT AN UNCOMFORTABLE MORAL DILEMMA
IT JUST REDEFINED THE PROBLEM
NOW WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BREAK DOWN A REJECTION
WE HAD THE DONOR IDENTIFIED
BECAUSE HE WAS A VERY LIKEABLE MAN
HE WAS A VERY NICE MAN
I'D NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE
WANT TO MEET ME
AND OBVIOUSLY HAD MORE AND MORE DIFFICULTY MAINTAINING ITS ACTION
AND IT WAS OBVIOUSLY THE END PART OF A VERY SWIFT PROJECTION PHENOMENA
SEEMS ALMOST JAW DROPPING
THE HEART TRANSPLANT DREAM WAS BEGINNING TO DIE
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT PATIENTS REQUIRED MUCH HIGHER DOSES OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DRUGS THAN
AND THE SURVIVAL RATES MADE GRIM READING
TWO THIRDS OF PATIENTS WHO HAD A HEART TRANSPLANT WERE DEAD WITHIN THREE MONTHS
AND VERY FEW MADE IT MUCH FURTHER
MY LEGS WERE VERY
WOULD YOU RISK YOUR HEALTH FOR THE HOPE OF SAVING A LOVED ONE
AND HE HAD BONE CANCER
BUT JUST AS WITH THE TRANSPLANT PIONEERS
THEY SOON DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE BESET BY DEATH
WE SAID NATURE HAS ALREADY BUILT THE PERFECT SCAFFOLD
THEY WILL CREATE MORAL DILEMMAS FOR THE SURGEONS WHO ARE PUSHING AT THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE
YOU WERE STILL ON IT WHEN YOU PULLED UP THE
WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER TAKE
ANYTHING YOU DO SAY MAY BE GIVEN EVIDENCE
YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW DISTRACTED YOU ARE
JUST FINISHED WORK
IF THE ERROR IS ON THE PART OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY
IF THEY SAY IT'S HER FAULT
AND FROSTING IT
BECAUSE TIME IS UP
WE'VE DONE THE MAMMALS
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING SMALL
SO THAT IF YOU WERE OF THE HUNTING
SO IT'S EARLY IN THE PRODUCTION RUN
WITHOUT A FLASK
BUT WHY DON'T WE FIND OUT
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
SO FIRST OF ALL
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
IT HAS TAKEN OVER
THIS REALLY IS JUST A STEP FURTHER FROM THAT
MADE A MIRACULOUS DIVERSION
IF HARD TO BELIEVE
IT WAS A BIZARRE EXPERIENCE
ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT CONCERN YOU
IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO SPEAK
IF I SHOULD BE STRUCK DOWN
THE POPULAR PARISH CONDUCTOR
YOU ARE ONLY A PRIVATE BUT
THEY WILL SPOT US
THEY WILL BE TAKEN BY AGENT CRABTREE
YOU CAN SIGN UP TO THE SPORT RELIEF MILE
WHICH YOU CAN WALK WITH YOUR DOG
IT'S HAPPENING NOW
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
SOME OLDER THAN MYSELF
I TEACH PEOPLE TO MAKE MUSIC
FROM YOU IN GLASGOW
I'VE WALKED INTO WALLS
THEY WANTED TWO BEDSIDE TABLES
SO IN CASE IT GOES WRONG
SO IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY FLOWERS ON THEM
OF ALL ITS BATTLES
GOING UP TO THE FRONT LINE ONLY A COUPLE OF MILES AWAY
SOME WERE TALKING DELIRIOUSLY
OTHERS CALLING FOR HELP AND ASKING FOR WATER
AND HE SENT A MESSAGE BACK TO BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS
IVE TRIED TWO ADVANCES
I WILL OF COURSE ATTACK
OTHERS WERE DRAGGED TO SAFETY BY THEIR MATES
OPEN CREST BEHIND ME
SOME OF THESE SOLDIERS DIED IN JULY
THE ALLIES HAD SUFFERED OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
THE WHITES ACTUALLY START TO SEPARATE
THE CHAIN WENT FROM THE BAR WITH A BELL ON IT
AND IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY SIMPLE TO MAKE THEM
A TAP THAT'S IN A MAPLE TREE
THEY WERE ADMITTED TO A DESERTED CHATEAU BY MY WAITRES MIMI
AND JACK AND JILL ARE STANDING IN A BUCKET
I AM AMBIVALENT
MY WIFE IS ABOUT TO SING
I WAS THE GONDOLIER IN VENICE
WE ARE THE THE CHAMPION RUIN CLUB
WE ARE PRACTICING FOR THE REGATTA
WE HAVE MORE WAGS THAN THE ENGLAND SQUAD
I THINK WE SHOULD CUT TO THE MOMENT THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR
IT'S ALSO ABOUT RAISING MONEY SO SPORT RELIEF CAN CHANGE THE LIVES OF SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWO MEMBERS OF EACH TEAM HAVE NOW PLAYED WHICH LEAVES ONE REMAINING
THAT TWO ONE LEAD OF THEIRS WILL EARN THEM A VERY HANDY TIME ADVANTAGE IN THE FINAL DECIDING GAME
BUT IF YOU WANT TO TAKE PART IN ALL THE SPORT RELIEF FUN AND GAMES THEN PLEASE SIGN UP FOR AN EVENT
THANKS TO ALL OUR DOGS AND THE OWNERS FOR TAKING PART AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING
NO QUESTIONS ASKED
I CAN'T SHOW THAT
ELEGANT AND WITH A WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE
BUT IT STILL CAN BE QUITE A BUSINESS
THEY HAD GOT UNDERGROUND BARRACKS
IF TANKS APPEARED
CARBINES AND HAD A FEW ANTITANK GUNS
ONE OF THE GERMAN COMMANDERS
RECKONED IT WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST DAYS FIGHTING OF HIS ENTIRE CAREER
THE MOTORCYCLE RECONNAISSANCE
AND MILES BEHIND
AND THE REQUIREMENT WAS TO HAVE A SLOW MOVING TANK
A BRITISH RECONNAISSANCE REGIMENT
IT'S TYPICAL OF THE DAY'S CONFUSION THAT IT WAS JUST SHORT OF THE LINE WHERE THE BATTLE WAS
AND LATER THAT NIGHT
THEY BROKE OUT WITH THE HELP OF FRENCH TANKS
THE OFFICERS AND NCOS COLLECTED THEMSELVES AND SAID
BUT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET SOME OF THE MEN MOVING
HE DROVE HERE UP ONTO THIS HILLOCK
WHERE THERE WERE SOME GERMAN GUNS
HE WAS MORTALLY WOUNDED
ONE BRITISH OFFICER SAID THAT WE HAD A GLORIOUS FREE FOR ALL
ONE YOUNG OFFICER DROVE UP HERE AND SAW ABOUT TWENTY TANKS LYING IN THIS FIELD
ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T KNOW IT
BUT IT WAS THE ALLIES' TRAGEDY THAT
HONEY IS THE MAIN FLAVOUR
IS THAT THE FLAVOUR IS GOOD BUT THE TEXTURE IS VERY CHEWY
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN PART DRIED IN ORDER TO GET HERE
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE THE TRIP
WHEREAS IF YOU TAKE FRESH SHIAR MUSHROOMS
THERE IS JUST SUCH AN AMAZING DIFFERENCE IN TEXTURE
I ENJOY THE CHALLENGES
SORT OF THE THE ENGINEERING SIDE OF IT
AND JUST LOOK AT THAT
WHICH BREAKS DOWN THE FAT
IT'S A DESSERT THAT SHOWS A LITTLE BIT OF SKILL IN TERMS OF THE PASTRY BUT
BUT THERE IS A REAL DANGER IF IT STAYS TOO LONG
IN MY EXPERIENCE
AS LONG AS A FLOOD DOESN'T LAST FOR MORE THAN SAY TEN DAYS
NOTHING SUFFERS AT ALL
AND THE FIRST ONE HE VISITS IS A WET GARDEN IN TEMPERATUREHIRE
IT TELLS ME ITSELF
IF WE WANT TO GET A NICE
RACHEL WENT TO THE GARDEN OF THE ROSE IN ST ALBANS TO LOOK AT THEIR LONG
NAMED TO EXPRESS THE OPTIMISM FOR THE FUTURE
IN ONE SINGLE YEAR
THERE WERE FORTY TO FIFTY MILLION SOLD
WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARY
BUT BY THE NINETEEN EIGHTY S AND NINETY S
TASTES WERE CHANGING AND PEOPLE WANTED ROSES THAT COMBINED THE ROMANCE
THE FORM OF OLD ROSES
THAT'S IT FOR THIS WEEK
BUT I'LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK AT THE SAME TIME
THE FINAL PROCESS IN PREPARING THEM IS TO GIVE THEM A GOOD MULCH
I NOTICED ONE THING ABOUT THAT YOUNG WOMAN
SEVEN MILES TODAY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
GIVING OUR TEAMS PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO POKE AROUND AND FIND SOMETHING TO MAKE A BIG PROFIT WITH
SO TO DO THE DEGREE I HAVE TO GO TO HIGH WELCOME
THIS IS ACTING FOR THIS CENTURY INVOLVING
ALSO WORKING WITH GREEN SCREEN
IF THEY GO FOR IT AND IT MAKES A LOSS
IT WASN'T TOO DEAR
IS THE EXPERT TAKING ANY LEFTOVER MONEY FROM THE SHOPPING AND GOING OFF AND FINDING A
THEY GET TO KEEP THE PROFIT
YOU ARE PLUS FIFTEEN PO
YOU HAVE TEN POUND
BUT THE EARLY SETTLERS HERE CLEARLY THOUGHT THIS ANIMAL WAS SOME KIND OF DEMON FROM THE NAMES THEY
THEY CALLED IT THE MUD PUPPY
THAT IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT LIKE HELL
TO REGENERATE THE TAIL
THERE ARE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF PREDATORS JUST WAITING FOR A FEED
IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT SPECTACLES IN THE NATURAL WORLD
IN THE DARK CABINS BENEATH OUR FEET RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE IT IS OUR CHRISTMAS SPECIAL
WE ARE GOING TO EXPLORE NEW PERSPECTIVES BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE LISTENING TO THE SOUNDS OF THE
BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE BRINGING YOU WEIRD AND WONDERFUL NOISES FROM RIGHT ACROSS THE UNIVERSE
BY LISTENING TO THESE SOUNDS
IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE
IT'S A VACUUM OUT THERE AND THE SOUNDS OF THE SUN CAN'T TRAVEL DIRECTLY TO US
THAT TELLS US SOMETHING ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE PIPES
THE SOUND MAKES THE SUN GENTLY BREATHE IN AND OUT
EARTH BUT WE CAN THINK ABOUT WHAT SOUND WOULD BE LIKE ON OTHER PLANETS
ESPECIALLY IF THE TARGET IS BIG AND BRIGHT
I FIND IT FANTASTIC
TRYING AT TEN
SO THERE IS MORE STUFF IN ONE PLACE AND LESS STUFF IN SOMEWHERE ELSE
THOSE HOT PATCHES WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF STUFF
SO YOU THEY LOOK IN FOR WORK
AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
YOU COULD WELL BE RIGHT
THEY'RE FRIENDS AT THE MOMENT
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG
IT'S A ROTATING CIGARETTE BOX
SO I COLLECT FORENSIC EVIDENCE TO TRY AND SOLVE THE CRIME
IF YOU'D GONE AROUND THE CORNER
YOU MIGHT HAVE FOUND
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
THERE'S SOME POTENTIAL THERE
ON THE PROBABILITY OF PROBABILITY
GET ON THE BLOWER
OR SIMPLY TO ATTRACT GERMAN ARMOUR SO THAT THE AMERICANS COULD STAGE AN ATTACK OF THEIR OWN CALLED
THEIR TANKS WERE THROWN ABOUT LIKE TOYS
ONE REMEMBERED HOW IT WAS A REGULAR CARPET BOMBARDMENT
MANY OF THE FIRST BRITISH TANKS DESTROYED
THE BATTLEFIELD WAS STILL SO NARROW THAT THE ATTACKERS WERE ALL STACKED UP BEHIND A SINGLE
WHEN IT HIT A SHERMAN
IN THE JARGON OF THE DAY
AND EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON
AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT
THEN IT WAS THE FAMILIAR STORY OF SHERMAN'S BREWING UP
FASHION CHANGES ALL THE TIME AND WE FOLLOW THE FASHION AND WE PLUCK FROM THE PAST
AND THIS IS WHY THESE CUFF LINKS
THE LATE NINETEENTH AND VERY EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY
SO WE'RE GOING FROM THAT QUITE HEAVY
IT'S VERY LIGHT
THESE DAYS THE WEDDING RING IS ABOUT AS BEJOED AS A MAN WOULD GET BUT HISTORY TELLS
WITHOUT ITS STORY
THE STORY ACTUALLY EQUALISED THAT AND AND DID IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT YOU MUST ALWAYS BE AWARE OF
EVERYTHING THAT GLIERS IS NOT GOLD
HIS MEANING EVERYTHING THAT LOOKS VALUABLE ISN'T NECESSARILY SO GOLD OR NOT
HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT
NOT ALWAYS BUT MOST OF THE TIME
LOOK AT THE AGE OF IT
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS
AND ANY GOOD AUCTION HOUSE
PEOPLE WANT DIFFERENT THINGS
PICK UP A PIECE OF GLASS
SEMI PRECIOUS STONE IN THAT HAND
EVERYONE THINKS COINS
THE OTHER INTERESTING POINT HERE IS
IT'S IN SOME WAY RESPECTFUL TO WHAT THEY GAVE FOR THEIR COUNTRY SEVENTY
BUT STILL RELEVANT
WHEN SOMETHING IS VERY PRECIOUS LIKE THAT
WE OFTEN FIND THAT THINGS ARE COPIED AND THAT THERE ARE IMITATIONS AND WE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US
HE WOULD HAVE GOT THE WHOLE REWARD
OR EVEN A ROMAN COIN
STILL ON REALLY EARLY COINS
YOU CAN GET SOME THAT WERE IN UNCIRCULATED CONDITION
SO REMEMBER THAT
ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT
IT WOULD SET YOU BACK AROUND TWENTY
BECAUSE IT'LL PROBABLY BE A ONE OFF AND THERE WON'T BE ANOTHER ONE AROUND
THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT IS TO MAKE
BECAUSE IT CAN MEAN THAT THERE ARE LESS COLLECTORS
ENAMELLED WITH BIRDS
BY A GREAT MAKER
BUT NOT ALL PIECES ARE NAMED
AND HAS NO ARTISTIC MERIT WHATSOEVER
NO CHIPPING TO THE ENAMELLING
WORK YOUR WAY UP TO THE LARGER PLATES
GET ONE WITH A BROAD RIM
THEY STARTED AROUND ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED POS IN PRETTY AVERAGE CONDITION
SO THERE YOU ARE
GET OUT THERE AND GET BUYING
HE DID HIS OWN ENAMELLING SO THAT HE DID THE WHOLE OBJECT
WHICH WAS BRILLIANT
SEE HOW THEY FIT
WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD SUIT YOU
START A COLLECTION AND
BUT ALWAYS TRADE UPWARDS AND LOOK FOR QUALITY AND ENJOY YOURSELF
ONLY ONE THING PREVENTS ME FROM LEAVING
TELL ME NOTHING
FATE IS FORTUNATELY ON OUR SIDE
THE GENERAL WILL BE IN CALAI VISITING BIG BERTHA
I WILL PASS THE MESSAGE TO THE RESISTANCE
WHO I DO NOT KNOW
HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN
THE HIGHER THE RANK
WAY WE GET TO THE HACKS ON
THE GREATER THE PENALTY
I CANNOT LET YOU TAKE THE RISK
PEOPLE DROP THINGS
I HAVE GIVEN THOUGHT TO THIS MATTER
JUST A ONE A LITTLE SIP
THAT IS THE WINDOW OF THE CHATEAU IN WHICH THE AIRMEN ARE IMPRISONED
THERE IS A DUPLICATE IN BERLIN
DAVID AND ELLIE
LET'S BRING IT ON
TWO GAMES
AND WHY NOT JOIN US TO RAISE MONEY AND CHANGE LIVES
SPORT RELIEF IS WORKING TO SAVE LIVES AND TO CHANGE THEM FOR THE BETTER
THEY WILL BE STARTING THEIR RUN WITH FIFTEEN SECONDS ALREADY ADDED TO THE CLOCK
CITIES LIKE LIVERPOOL OVER THERE
QUITE CLOSED ABOUT OUR WORK
THAT SEEMS TO BENEFIT MOST FROM THE NETWORKING
THOSE SOUTHERN HUBS
MAKE OURSELVES ACCESSIBLE
LET'S HAVE MORE CAMBRIDGE
LET THE CITY BUILD EVEN MORE
BREAK THROUGH ALL THOSE BOUNDARIES
BUT IF YOU WANT OPPORTUNITY
GROWTH AND INCOME
ONE WAY OF GETTING BOTH WOULD BE TO SAY
THEY DON'T LIVE ROUND HERE
IT'S WELL OVER A DECADE
IN ST PANCRAS STATION IN LONDON
WHERE THEY NEEDED THE JOBS
BUT THERE IS ONE LAST CHAPTER TO THIS TALE
AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO GET A PIECE OF THE ACTION
CITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PULL OFF THE SAME TRICK
BUT ARE GOING TO BE SORT OF ONE OR TWO SPOTS DOWN THE LEAGUE TABLE IN THEIR AREA
LIFE SCIENCES CENTRE
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
DOESN'T MEAN EVERYWHERE ELSE HAS TO BE BEREFT OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
WE HAVE THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE THAT WE EMPLOY
WE TRAIN OUR OWN TALENT
WHEREAS IN MANCHESTER
AND START INVESTING IN THOSE PROPERTIES
CHECKS ARE CARRIED OUT
WHILST ON HOLIDAY OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS
IT GOT TANGLED UP
SO I'LL GIVE THEM NOW SORT OF TWENTY MINUTES TO CONTACT AN INSURANCE COMPANY
SO YOU KNOW IF I CAN TRY AND HELP THE FAMILY A LITTLE BIT
BUT WE'LL GIVE HIM TWENTY MINUTES
NO LETTERS CONFIRMING IT
WHICH SHOWED THERE WASN'T A BLEED IN THE BRAIN
HE'S ABLE TO RESUME HIS HOLIDAY AND
DURING THE TWENTY SIX YEARS OF OPERATING AN AIR AMBULANCE IN CORNWALL
WE DID HAVE CHILDREN HERE
THEY WERE STILL AWAY FROM HOME AS WELL AND THEY WEREN'T SURE WHERE MUMMY AND DADDY HAD DISAPPEARED
ONE IS QUITE FORCEFUL
THE OTHER GOES ALONG WITH IT
ONCE THE OTHER ONE DOES LIKE SOMETHING
MAKES THIS THING
AND GUESS WHAT THE FIRST PRODUCTION OUT OF THE BRAND NEW FACTORY WAS IN
THAT WAS BECAUSE THIS PART OF STAFFORDSHIRE HAD AN ABUNDANCE OF CLAY
YOU GET IT WITH A RICH COLOUR SCHEME
THEY COULD BE DOING ANYTHING TO HER
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE
AND JUDGING BY YOUR STORIES OF MIRACULOUS CAR BOOT FINDS AND FANTASTIC JUMBLE SALE DISCOVERIES
ALL OVER THE BRITISH ISLES
BUY SOMETHING DISTINCTIVE
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
THEY LIKE TO FIND IT IN ORIGINAL CONDITION
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN
AFTER THE EVENT
THE LAST LAUGH WAS WITH YOULIN
IT'S STILL VERY BOR FOR RARE AND UNUSUAL ITEMS
BOXES OF CHOCOLATES
SO I WAS AMAZED TO HEAR THAT
AND THAT THAT WAS VERY EXCITING
I NEVER ACTUALLY SET OUT TO BUY
AND WHEN I GOT HOME AND I RUMMAGED ABOUT
BUT THERE ARE NO HOLES IN HIM
AND ONE DAY I'LL GET IT CHECKED OUT
I JUST LIKE HIM AS HE IS
I DON'T KNOW THAT I WANT TO KNOW TOO MUCH MORE ABOUT HIM
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW
THERE ARE BARGAINS TO BE HAD OUT THERE
REGULAR FLOGGED AUCTIONEER NICK HALL LOVES ALL KINDS OF ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES
BUT HE'S ESPECIALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT PAINTINGS
WHAT COLLECTORS MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR
IS IN OUR ANNUAL DEGREE SHOW
THAT'S JUST A SIDELINE TO SHOWING THE STUDENTS' WORK
AND THE MARKET CHANGES WHICH ALSO PARTLY DETERMINES WHAT A GOOD PAINTING IS
GET READY FOR THIS
GET UNDER THE TABLES
IF YOU THINK THAT SOMETHING LOOKS LIKE IT'S REALLY WELL MADE AND IT'S A NICE PIECE AND IT'S PERHAPS GOT
WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING IN SAYING WE BOUGHT THIS IN A JUMBLE SALE
GET GET READY FOR THIS
HANNAH AND FLORENCE BARLOW
NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY
THEY WILL PICK UP AGAIN
IN THE FUTURE AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE SORT OF DONE QUITE WELL
WE HAD ONE RECENTLY MADE IN EXCESS OF THREE
THERE ARE OTHERS YOU
BUT DUNHILL WERE REALLY THE FIRST PIONEERS WHEN IT CAME TO LIGHTERS
I BOUGHT IT IMMEDIATELY
SO IT WAS IT WAS A DRIVING ACCESSORY
TO HAVE ANY VALUE
THEY NEED TO BE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION
THE ONE THAT WE SAW WAS IN MINT CONDITION
IF YOU BOUGHT SOMETHING YOU LOVE
THEY'D OBVIOUSLY BEEN USED
THEY'D OBVIOUSLY BEEN ON THE WALL SOMEWHERE A STATION
WHEN THE AUCTIONEER STARTED LOOKING AT THEM
HE THOUGHT MAYBE ONE OR TWO OF THEM MIGHT BE QUITE A BIT VALUABLE
HE IS RATHER EXCITED
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY'S SHOW
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED WATCHING
WHICH IS BROKEN
TO BORROW HIS AMMER AND CHISEL
I CAN THROW SOME PEASANTS OUT
YOU BOTH HAVE CONTACTS WITH SIR UNDERWORLD
THINGS MAY GET A BIT HOT
NUMBER THIRTY TWO RUAG GASCO
WHAT IS YOUR SIN
YOU HAVE THE WRONG IDEA
WE DO NOT GIVE MONEY
BUT WHAT IT DOES NEED IS A SET OF EYES
I HAVE TWO SKULLS HERE FROM ANIMALS ROUGHLY THE SAME SIZE
THE FIRST ONE IS FROM A MARMOSET
WHEN I PRESS IT
STRAIGHT TO THE BUZZER
IT'S DEFINITELY UP THERE
A BACKGROUND NOISE
AND THIS MAKES THEM REALLY HARD BUT QUITE FRAGILE
AND THEY ARE A TYPE OF INSECTIVOROUS MAMMALS THEY ARE DISTANTLY RELATED TO SHREWS
AFTER THAT IT GOES INTO THE BRAIN
YOU CAN'T FORREZE THAT
WHY DON'T YOU COME ROUND FOR LUNCH TOMORROW
I'M SURE PAUL WOULD LOVE YOU BOTH TO COME
I'LL MAKE SURE THE REAL FLAME FIRES UP AND RUNNING
BUT IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING
WE CAN BE FLEXIBLE WITH DATES
MY HUSBAND PAUL'S JOINING ME LATER
DEPENDING ON WORK
WON'T SAY HOW MUCH
I TRY AND STEER CLEAR OF THE RESIDENTIALS
AH BUT I SAY SO FAR
IT JUST FEELS REALLY
I DON'T WANT TO BE A RESIDENT
I CAN'T LIVE HERE
YOU'RE ALREADY A CRIMINAL
I'M SORRY ABOUT
WE PRETTY MUCH HAVE THE BASIC SKILLS THAT THEY DO ON AS AH AS A ROAD AMBULANCE PARAMEDIC
SO WE LAND IN A FIELD
WE LANDING IN A FOOTBALL FIELD
WE NEED TO REPERFUSE THAT PART OF THE HEART BY UNBLOCKING THAT CORONARY ARTERY
AH SCHOOL HOLIDAYS
STUFF LIKE THAT
AND I WAS JUST COMING BACK DOWN THE RAMP AND ANOTHER GUY LOST HIS BALANCE
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
WHICH OF OUR TEAMS WILL CHALK UP A VICTORY AT AUCTION
MY SPECIAL SUBJECT IS THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUT YOU IN A BLACK
LET'S HAVE A QUICK PEEK AT WHAT'S COMING UP
WE MET AT A FRIEND'S WEDDING
HE WAS BEST MAN
HE TOOK ME TO PARIS TO PROPOSE AND WE GOT MARRIED THE FOLLOWING YEAR ON VALENTINE'S
THE RACE IS OVER
YOU WANT TO COME TO ONE OF THESE FAIRS AND YOU'VE ONLY GOT TWENTY POUNDS IN YOUR POCKET
I CALL IT SHED WORK BECAUSE ONCE UPON A TIME
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
YOU'RE NOW MINUS FIVE
SIXTY POUNDS ON THE RIGHT SIXTY
IT'S AS EASY AS A
ON THE A E OF TV COOKING
HE'S BAKING BREAD
HAS IT HAPPENED
IT'S ABOUT MINUS FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS
MOMENT BUT WITH THE WIND CHILL FACTOR
NOT JUST A FEW BAD WINTERS
NOT ON THOSE THAT ARE WASHED BY WATER
WHILE THESE ROCKS WERE CLEARLY ONCE PUMMELLED BY THE WAVES
THEY BURIED THEIR DEAD
RIGHT HERE IN THE CENTRE OF LONDON
SOME OF THEM MUCH WARMER EVEN THAN TODAY
WHILE IT'S ORBITING IT ALSO TILTS ON ITS AXIS VERY SLOWLY OVER THOUSANDS OF
DRAMATIC CHANGE AGE WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE
WHEREVER YOU LIVE
BUT THE MOST DRAMATIC EFFECT OF THE LAST ONE WAS THAT WHEN THE ICE MELTED
THE LEVEL OF THE WORLD SEAS ROSE
YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND IT RIGHT HERE
COMPLETE WITH LABELS OF GLAMOROUS FAR OFF PLACES AND SHIPPING LINES SELL VERY
BECAUSE THERE'S A WEALTH OF STUFF OUT THERE THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT
YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN QUITE A WEALTHY PERSON
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS JUST AN INTERESTING SUBJECT
DECO SKI POSTERS
WHICH ULTIMATELY REVOLUTIONISED TRAVEL
THESE INTERIOR DESIGNERS AND
SO IT'S ALWAYS WORTH
WHEN YOU GET A SUITCASE
HAVING A GOOD OLD LOOK AROUND THE RIM TO SEE IF THEY'VE GOT SOME NICE RETAILERS' NAMES ON
FROM FROM THE SORT OF ENTHUSIAST THAT LIKES AN ORDNANCE SURVEY MAP OF THE AREA THEY LIVE INTO THE REAL
BECAUSE TO ACTUALLY AFFORD TO TRAVEL AT ALL
STOCKPORT THE HOME OF HAT MAKING
THROUGH THE RAIN AND THE WIND
ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT
TRAMS AND HORSES AND CARRIAGES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN IMAGINE THERE WAS A REAL NEED FOR SALESMEN'S SAMPLES AND
LOOK AT THE QUALITY
AS IT'S ALWAYS DEPRESSING WHEN THEY DON'T LIKE IT
PO WHICH IS AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY FOR IT
WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER COMPARABLE EXAMPLES
IT'S RIGHT UP MY STREET
BUT IN DAYS GONE BY
YOU CAN IMAGINE THEM BEING OPENED UP AND FOLDED OUT AND STUDIED AND MAYBE GOT WET AND FOLDED AWAY
WE TEND TO TAKE THEIR PRESENCE FOR GRANTED REALLY
WHAT COULD BE BETTER
I WOULD DEFINITELY INVEST IN ONE OF THESE
WAS I RELATED TO A CHAP CALLED FRED FLETCHER
DURBAN AND BOMBAY
THERE'S THE FRONT OF AN ENVELOPE
UM I KNOW THAT TOM
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD
IT FALLS TO BITS FAIRLY QUICKLY
IT'LL COST YOU MORE
BUT IT WILL BE WELL WORTH COLLECTING
DON'T JUST BUY SOMETHING BECAUSE IT'S GOT RAMSGATE ON IT
SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD SCOFF AT HOLIDAY SOUVENIRS
WE ALL LIKE TO BRING BACK SOUVENIRS
AND THEY CAN BE DESIRABLE
VALUATION DAY YOU GET VERY EXCITED
WHEN YOU FIND IT'S BY A VERY BIG AND IMPORTANT MAKER
BUT HOW DO YOU DISTINGUISH THE TOURIST TAT FROM THE HIDDEN GEMS
SINCE THE TENTH CENTURY
AND IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS PARTICULARLY IT'S BEEN A GREAT AREA FOR TOURISTS
SOUVENIR HUNTERS ETC TO BRING BACK COLOURFUL PAPERWEIGHTS
WHEN IT MADE THE EIGHT HUNDRED
IT WAS REALLY ONLY THE RICH
WE HAVE TO THINK OF TUNBRIDGE WHEEL
I AM SO FAR FROM BEING PERFECT FOR YOU
WHICH WILL BE DELIVERED TO YOU DISGUISED AS PRIZE WINNING VGE
WE CANNOT CHANGE THE PLANS
AND WEARING THEIR UNIFORMS
REST ASSURED THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO BLOW UP YOUR CAFE
FANNY NOW YOU SEE IT
AND WE FLIPPED A COIN TO SEE WHO'S GOING FIRST SO
THE BEST WAY TO FUND RAISE IS BY GETTING SPONSORED TO ENTER AN EVENT AT THE SPORT RELIEF GAMES BUT
TWO GAMES TO ONE
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
I'M I'M A NEWCASTLE FAN AND DARN
SO WE' GOING TO TRY AND COMPENSATE AND BUY SOME SILVERWARE TODAY
OUT OF INTEREST
AND SUPPORTING PATIENTS AT HOME WITH THEIR RESPIRATORY DISEASE CALLED CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT
LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS CHEAP AS CHIPS
THE MORNING ROOM
THAT DISCOVERY HORRIFIED THE MAN AND AS A RESULT IT'S THOUGHT THAT THEIR MARRIAGE WAS NEVER
IT WAS COMMISSIONED BY JOHN RUSKIN
GOOD OLD BLIGHTY
NONE OF THIS WATER WAS HERE
MORE SEEDS WOULD BLOW IN AND GRADUALLY
THOSE GRAINS WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM
BUT AS THE WATERS FLOODED THE LAND BRIDGE
AND IN MORE RECENT TIMES
MAKERS AND WRITERS HAVE CONTINUED TO FIND THEIR MUSE IN THE WORLD AROUND THEM
SO IN TODAY'S PROGRAMME
NOT JUST REAL PLANTS AND FLOWERS
SO WHAT DESERVES A CLOSER LOOK
THAT IS A BIG SOLD SOUND
BUT MORRIS WARE WAS ACTUALLY PRODUCED OVER A MUCH SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME
AND ANYTHING SCOTTISH GOES BACK HOME
BECAUSE IT'S GOT THIS SCOTTISH PULL
WHERE THESE CABINETS WERE MADE
WHICH HAS BEEN EBONISED SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A DARK BLACK
WHICH CONTRASTS BEAUTIFULLY WITH THE GILDING THAT PICKS OUT ALL THE MOULDINGS AND THE ARCHITECTURAL
IT'S IT'S GOT A WARMTH AND A QUALITY ABOUT IT
SMALL HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN TURNED OUT OF WOOD
UM NORMALLY THESE WONDERFUL LITTLE ITEMS ARE MADE FROM FRUIT WOODS GROWN HERE IN THIS COUNTRY BUT
BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN THEY TURN UP WITH EXOTIC HARDWOODS FROM OVERSEAS
IT TELLS US ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE WORLD AT THAT TIME AND YOU KNOW HOW INTERESTING IS THAT
SO LOOK FOR QUALITY
BUT IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY YOUR TIMBERS
OF WHICH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SURVIVE TODAY
MANY OF THEM WERE DRAWN FROM LIFE
MOST OF HIS DRAWINGS FROM LIFE
INTREPID EXPLORERS HAVE BROUGHT BACK TALES OF THE CREATURES THEY'VE SEEN AND THEIR STORIES HAVE
DOES THE PICTURE WORK
IF IT DOES THEN IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING
MAYBE A LESSER ARTIST OR SOMEONE TRYING TO COPY
BUT FOR SOMEONE ELSE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT THEM BUT
BUT EVERYONE KNOWS A TWITCHER
AND YOU HEAR STORIES OF PEOPLE TRAVELLING THOUSANDS OF MILES JUST TO SEE ONE BIRD THAT MAYBE GOT
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND AND ALSO SOME OF THE MORE OBSCURE ANIMALS WILL APPEAL TO PEOPLE
EMUS AND KOALAS AND PENGUINS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
SO I THINK ANY ANIMAL IS GOOD NEWS
ALL OF A SUDDEN
I'VE GOT THE CROWN JEWELS HERE
IF THAT'S THE CASE
THE ORIGINAL'S PROBABLY IN THE V A AND YOU'VE GOT A PRINT OF IT
SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE COLLECTABLE THAN OTHERS
WHEREAS OTHER BIRD PICTURES
WHEN THEY'RE PERCHED ON A BRANCH OR IN A TREE
THEY DON'T QUITE SIT
HE'S GOT GRAVITY RIGHT
THEY STAND WELL
THEY ALSO HAD A GREAT STORY
THEY WERE PICKED UP
THEY'RE NOT MY FAVOURITE BREED OF DOG
I WISH I COULD FIND THOSE FOR A POUND
IT WAS A GREAT INVESTMENT
IT WAS A GREAT BUY
TOOK THIS DOOR OUT OF THE CUPBOARD
SO BUY SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE AND PLEASES YOU
I STILL THINK I AM RIGHT
AND I HOPE HE HAS
I HAVE SEEN PIGS AND I HAVE SEEN SOME LITTLE DOGS AND THINGS BUT
AND SILVER ONES ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE FOUND FOR USE IN SHOPS OR PUBLIC PLACES
PRETENDING TO BE BRONZE AS WELL
THAT'S WHEN YOU NEED TO GET YOUR MAGNET OUT
IF YOU HAVE ANY ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES THAT NEED REHOMING
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY'S SHOW
NICE TO SEE YOU
HE SAYS HE HAS NEWS OF THE COLON
WHO I DO NOT KNOW
THEY WERE ROUGH PEASANT WOMEN
THEY ALSO WILL BE BLOWN UP
DOGS ARE FAMOUS FOR BEING MAN'S BEST FRIEND
THE TEAM WITH THE HIGHEST SCORE IS THE WINNER
NOW WE FLIPPED A COIN TO SEE WHO'S GOING FIRST
THE MORE TIME IT WILL COST THEM
POINTS WILL BE BANKED ONCE THE DOG HAS BROUGHT THE BOY BACK TO THE HANDLER
BUT HOW ABOUT A TREAT FOR ALL OF YOU AT HOME
AND ONE IN WHICH SPEED IS OF THE ESSENCE
THE MONEY THAT IS BEING RAISED WILL CHANGE THE LIVES OF SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE AROUND
EVERY TEXT REALLY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
SO PLEASE DO GIVE IF YOU CAN
AND WE HAVE OUR FINAL TWO TO PLAY
ONLY THE TOP FOUR WINNING TIMES OF THE SERIES WILL MAKE IT THROUGH
FOR THE INTERNET
LIKE I ALWAYS SAY
JUST GET ME THE PHONE
GO AND GET YOUR CLOTHES ON
BUR AND ENTHUSIAST WANT TO GET THEIR HANDS ON SOMETHING THAT WAS ONCE TOUCHED BY THE HAND THAT
HE WAS THE MOST POPULAR AUTHOR OF HIS TIME AND ALSO THE MOST PROLIFIC
IT'S NICE TO HAVE THE TWO TOGETHER UM BUT
IT'S IT'S IT'S RATHER ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYBODY
AND THEY'RE RATHER CHARMING
IF YOU COME ACROSS A BOOK OF SUCH QUALITY
IS GOING TO BE INTO THE THOUSANDS YOU
THE ROMANTIC NOVELS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ARE A GOOD PLACE TO START
A MAN WHO'S COME TO EPITOMISE THE ROMANTIC NOVEL AND A MAN WHOSE LEGACY ANITA MANNING GREATLY ADMIRE
WHICH SOME PEOPLE WOULD THINK I'M BUNKERS SPENDING THAT SORT OF MONEY ON A TOME LIKE THIS
I'M SURE IT WOULD TURN OUT TO BE A GOOD INVESTMENT BUT
MY SON IS AS KEEN ON CRIET AS I AM
MANY OF US DO MUCH OF OUR WRITING ON A KEYBOARD AND THE COMPUTER OR THE SMARTPHONE IS OUR PAGE
IF YOU SEE ONE OF THOSE
ALWAYS TRY AND STAND BACK FROM THE CROWD
BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY
AND PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT UNDERPRICED AT THE MOMENT
THEY CAN COME IN THE SHAPES OF RUGBY BALLS
COME THE SHAPE OF FOOTBALLS
A HOUSE CONTENTS
WHERE HE COLLECTED INKWELLS
READING A FAMILY MEMOIR IS LIKE HEARING A VOICE FROM THE PAST
STANDING HAVING THIS SORT OF ALTERCATION
THESE TO ME ARE MORE THAN MONEY I MEAN THIS IS VERY
IT'S THIS PLACE
THAT STORY WAS JUST CLEVER PR
SO WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH JANE AUSTEN
IF YOU'VE GOT MILLIONS OF POUNDS TO SPEND
YOU SPEND IT ON YOUR PASSION
TO THE MODERN DAY THE PRESENT PHENOMENA OF THE INTERNET
EVEN EARLIER THAN THAT
IT'S WELL WORTH A VISIT
AND IT'S THANKS TO HER DEDICATION AND HER PASSION THAT MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC CAN COME HERE
IF I HAD LOADS OF MONEY
AH SOMEBODY WHO DEFINITELY KNOWS HER BOOKS
THE ROPES OF THE BALLOON BECAME ACCIDENTALLY ENTANGLED IN THE BED CONTAINING MY WIFE'S MOTHER AND THEIR
IF YOU HAVE A MOMENT
I WANT THE PAINTINGS REMOVED AND A NEW CARPET IN PLACE
LESS OF A RISK THAN USUAL
AND HE GOES AROUND SCHOOLS AND
WE'RE OFF TO THE POOL FOR OUR FIRST GAME OF THE EVENING WHICH INVOLVES A SPOT OF WORDPLAY
THERE ARE FOUR MISSING LETTERS TO FIND
IT'S SUPER SLOW AND IT'S SUPER CUTE
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF WAYS YOU AND YOUR DOG CAN GET INVOLVED
AND TO CHANGE THEM
EVERY DONATION MAKES A VITAL DIFFERENCE
IT'S TIME FOR THE NEXT GAME
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING
WE'LL BE BACK HERE ON MONDAY
HAVE A NICE WEEKEND
LET'S DO SOMETHING POSITIVE
OR SIED GARDEN COMPOST
SO MUCH THE BETTER
AND VARIOUS DIFFERENT WAYS BUT
SO WE TAKE THE POLLEN FROM HERE
AND AS THEY DRY OUT
SO WHEN THE WEATHER DOES WARM UP THEY ARE AHEAD AND YOU GET AN EARLIER CROP
I MENTIONED THIS LAST YEAR
AND GOOD GARDENING MEANS GOING WITH IT AND
THIS IS ALL VERY SAD
AND CAROL IS DOING EXACTLY THAT WITH
WITH MORE AND MORECYCLAMEN
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THAT'S THE END OF THE BOX
WE'VE HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE
I RAISED MY HAND
THINKING SHE WAS GOING TO STRIKE ME
WHEN THIS FEATHER WAS PUSHED UP MY NOSE
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS ON
OF COURSE AND IT WAS A GREAT TREAT FOR US
WHICH EMBARRASSED ME VERY
THERE HAS TO BE MEN TO GO AND FIGHT FOR THE WOMEN
I DIDN'T LIKE IT
FIRING MACHINE GUNS
WE RAN ON ABOUT ANOTHER TWENTY YARDS TOWARDS THE GERMAN TRENCHES
AND EVEN WHEN MY ALL WOULD PUT THE NEWSPAPER DOWN
SUCH A BIG KNOCKING ON THE DOOR
RIGHT FROM FRANCE
AND I AM SPEAKING ONLY OF THE LIGHT EMOTIONS OF A BOY
ONE COULD NEVER SOMEHOW QUITE GET THROUGH
I WOULD LIKE IT
THERE WAS NO BUSES
AND A FRIEND OF HIS
ONE HAD THE CURADESHIP OF MEN
READY SPORT ONE
YOU HAD NO NOBODY AT YOUR SIDE
AND NOBODY WHO WAS CHEERING WITH YOU
OR FOUR IN A ROW EVEN
A GERMAN GOING DOWN
ANOTHER GERMAN ON HIS TAIL
ANOTHER HUN BEHIND THAT
SOMETIMES STANDING ON OUR TAILS
AND THEN IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL
AND WHEN YOU HADN'T HAD REST
I RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AS I WAS
WHATEVER'S TO DO
AND I FELT I DIDN'T WANT TO LIVE
I WONDER WHAT WE ARE ALL GOING TO DO NEXT
EVERYONE FINDS OUT
BELIEVE IT OR NOT
SEARCH FOR MITCHELL
AND THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT
I'M SORRY I MISSED YOU BEFORE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHO I AM AND WHAT I DO
NOT MUCH ELSE THEY CAN SAY
HOW HE USED TO BE
YOU KNOW WHAT WE MIGHT CALL AND EVERYTHING ELSE
YOU'LL STILL HAVE A RESTAURANT
WHAT WAS SHE LIKE BEFORE SHE WENT
I WON'T TESTIFY AGAINST ALICE
YOU BETTER THINK QUICK
THE NEXT YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU SAW HER KILL MICHAEL
WHEN WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME
YOU GO FOR LEXI
GIVE IT ONE MORE SECOND
I TOLD HIM NOT TO
WE'LL GO AS SOON AS WE GOT THE TRUTH
SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
SHE'S TERRIFIED THAT SHE CAN'T LIVE WITH AN INNOCENT GIRL GOING TO PRISON
AND AND AND THIS CHARLIE
ALFIE CAN HARDLY LOOK AT ME
SINCE SHE TALKED TO ME
THE LOW SELF EEEM
I WILL COVER THE ROOF IN PINK FUR FABRIC AND I WILL SELL IT TO KYLIE FOR SIXTY FIVE BILLION
AND IT WAS NOT PUT IN THAT SITUATION ORIGINALLY
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS A GREAT COUNTRY HOUSE THAT HAS ENDED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF A TOWN BECAUSE
AND THAT WASETH
BUT THEN AT SOME STAGE
PUT IT OUT TO AUCTION
WE KNOW THAT THE STEPNEYS HAD A PROPERTY IN SPITALFIELDS IN LONDON
BUT WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO RAISE ANOTHER FIFTY
I WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN THE FRONT DOOR AND TO BE
SO WE KNOW WE GOT WORK FOR TWENTY
IS GOING INTO THE SORT OF
AND FOR HOW LONG THAT IS
AND LOOKED AT THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE
NOW HOW THEY CARRY THAT ON AS A BUSINESS
IS NOW PASSED OVER TO A TRUST
I THINK YOU PAID THE RIGHT MONEY FOR IT
I'VE GOT TO SAY
YOU GIVE EVERYONE TEN
BECAUSE HER MOTHER
THEN YOU WANTED THE NEXT
YOU DIDN'T NEED SPECIALISED PREMISES
AND HOPEFULLY THEY GO UP IN PRICE
THEY ADOPTED A NEW APPROACH
YOU'RE VERY BRAVE
BLACK BELT KARATE
THAT'S A GOOD BUY
THE SHOW THAT AIMS TO PUT YOU IN THE KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO BUYING AND SELLING ANTIQUES AND
IN A EUROPEAN TASTE
AND THESE BOXES TENDED TO BE A VERY POPULAR FORM
AND I THINK IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORTH ONE FIFTY
THEN THEY SHOULD BE SOLD SEPARATELY
AND THEY MAY NOT WANT TO PAY TWO
JUST TO GET THE ONE THAT THEY WANT
BECAUSE THE BETTER PRICE ON THE AUCTION DAY
SINCE IT'S BECOME POPULAR
AND I THINK IF THESE THINGS ARE BURIED AND NOT TALKED ABOUT
THAT WAS FABULOUS
WE WERE ALL SURPRISED AT THE SALE PRICE OF BERNICE'S TONGAN CLUB
AND IT JUST GOES TO PROVE THAT THE AUCTION ROOM IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO SELL TRIBAL ARTEFACTS
WHICH DOES PUSH THE PRICE UP
MANY THINGS THAT ARE FAMILIAR WITH US TODAY ORIGINATED FROM THE BRITISH EMPIRE'S FOUR CORNERS
AND THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE OF PRECIOUS STONES
WHAT DOES ONE DO IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR EYEGLASS
AS THOMAS PLANT EXPLAINS
THEY'RE SO WHITE
ONCE A HOLE WAS BUILT
TAKING OUT ALL THE MOISTURE CONTENT
HMS VICTORY WOULD NOW SET SAIL ON ITS GREATEST VOYAGE EVER
WHEN HE SET SAIL ON THE VICTORY
THAT'S WHAT'S GIVEN IT ALL ITS CHARACTER AND CHARM
I DON'T BELIEVE AN ITEM LIKE THIS SHOULD SIT ON A SHELF
SO WE TRY AND USE THIS WHENEVER WE CAN
WE DECIDED TO CREATE OUR OWN
INSTEAD OF DOING THAT
LOOKING AT THIS
THIS REMARKABLE FORCE OF NATURE
HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE US FEEL INCREDIBLY FRAGILE AND VULNERABLE
THERE ARE PLENTY OF ALLIGATORS HERE AND THIS WOULD BE OUR MOST OBVIOUS CHOICE
BUT ACTUALLY OUR TARGET ANIMAL IS JUST AS PREHISTORIC
PLACES WHERE WE THINK THERE ARE FISH
EVEN A GOOD SIZED ALLIGATOR IS GOING TO LEAVE THIS WELL ALONE
THE ALLIGATOR GAR
WHEN YOU SEE A BIG MALE
THEY GO OUT AND THEY ACTIVELY SEEK THEIR PREY
I HAVE TO SAY THAT I REALLY WOULDN'T WANT TO BE A RAT OR A MOUSE OUT ON A NIGHTLIGHT TONIGHT
I WAS IN A VERY HIGH SPEED
AND SUBSEQUENTLY VERY HIGHLY PUBLICISED CAR CRASH
THE ROAD TO RECOVERY WAS
BUT IT WAS A LOT TOUGHER FOR MY FAMILY
I'VE BEEN EXTREMELY LUCKY SOME BRAIN INJURIES CAN LEAVE A PERSON NEEDING CONSTANT CARE AND
THERE IS A CHARITY DEDICATED TO HELPING FAMILIES LIKE ANNE MARIE'S
I COULD HEAR A SORT HIGH POWERED ENGINE AND SIRENS AND THINGS AND SHE SAID
YOU'VE GOT TO COME QUICK
CARING EXPERTS IN CHILDHOOD BRAIN INJURY
ALL UNDER ONE ROOF
JUST COMPLETELY AS HE IS ON THE BED
AND TRYING TO COME TO TERMS WITH A HUGE CHANGE IN THEIR LIVES
BECAUSE I'M ASKING YOU TO DONATE NOW TO THIS LIFE CHANGING CAUSE AND HELP
THE SOUTH COAST IN PARTICULAR BECAME REALLY FASHIONABLE
SO THAT GOES ON THROUGH THE FIFTY S
EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED AGAIN
PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO GO ABROAD FOR THEIR HOLIDAYS
A LOT OF THE ARTISTS THAT APPEARED THERE IN LATE SIXTY THREE
WERE AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR POWERS
RATHER THAN STAYING STAY
A PRIVATE COMPANY
RATHER THAN RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BUILDING
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM
THEY NEED RESPONSIBLE OWNERS WHO WILL TAKE THE MONEY THAT COMES OFF THE TOP AND PUT IT BACK IN
AND SO I HAD TO GET UP AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
THE PIS ON FIRE
GOT READY AS I WOULD NORMALLY
AND INSTEAD OF TURNING RIGHT TOWARDS CARAN
IT WASN'T JUST A TRAGEDY
THAT BECAUSE IT WAS UNSAFE
TALKING TO PEOPLE AND SAYING
THE HERITAGE LOTTERY SAID TO ME SINCE THAT THEY'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT
THAT NORMALLY THEY COME AND THEY HAVE A BIT OF A VISIT
AND THAT'S ALL THE LOCAL PEOPLE
NOT JUST A FEW TRUSTEES BUT
ALL THE MEMBERS
ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE MADE THIS DIFFERENCE
THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY COULD
AND NOT CAST IRON
THE MAINTENANCE COSTS OF AN OPEN SPACE MEAN THAT WE CAN PROBABLY CONCENTRATE MORE
IS THE THING THAT SUPPORTS EVERYTHING
BUT FOOD AND BEDDING WAS IN SHORT SUPPLY
ANIMALS HAD TO BE EVACUATED
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE AN APPETITE FOR CROPS THAT WE
OR ANIMALS COULD EAT
AND AS TOM'S BEEN FINDING OUT
I MEAN EVERY FEW DECADES
YOU GET A PRETTY MAJOR FLOOD
WHEN IT'S RECORDED ON CHURCHES SUCH AS THIS ONE
AND IT WAS OWNED BY FARMERS WHO LIVED ON THE SURROUNDING DRY LAND AREAS
AND THEY WOULD TAKE THEIR LIVESTOCK DOWN ONTO THE LEVELS IN THE SUMMER
FATTEN THE LIVESTOCK UP ON THE VERY VERY RICH GRAZING
BUT THEN THEY WOULD MOVE THEIR LIVESTOCK OFF THE LEVELS IN THE WINTER
POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROMISED TO FOLLOW UP THOSE GRANTS WITH LOANS OF UP TO
AND GETTING QUITE EXCITED ABOUT THEM BUT
BUT NOW THEY'RE SEEING HUGE CUT AND AND THERE IS A RISK THAT THEY WILL SAY
IT'S JUST TOO TOO RISKY FROM NOW ON
CAME UP WITH AN OFFER OF SHEDS AND WE WERE ABLE TO PUT THIRTY THREE
IT'S GOT A VERY UNUSUAL SHEEN
COULD THE N SIGHT
THREE AND EVEN SOME CASES
WE'VE GOT A FURTHER ONE GOING THROUGH PLANNING
THAT SOMEBODY CAN ACTUALLY USE WASTE PRODUCT AND CONVERT IT INTO ENERGY
WHAT A FANTASTIC IDEA THAT IS
BUT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'VE GOT SUCH A CONCENTRATION OF THEM IN ONE AREA
IT'S ONLY GOING TO HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT TO TRADITIONAL FARMING AND I'M TALKING TRADITIONAL
DAIRY FARMER LOOKING TO GROW MAIZE FOR STOCK FOR HIS OWN FARM WOULD BE LOOKING TO PAY ONE HUNDRED
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
THIS IS SEDGEMORE LIVESTOCK MARKET NEAR BRIDGEWATER AND IT'S BECOME AN IMPROMPTU DROPPING OFF POINT
I ALWAYS LIKE TO SEE THE COUNTRYFILE WEATHER FORECAST
I'LL BE ON THE NORTH NORFOLK COAST
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT
AND TALKING ABOUT BUSINESS
WHICH IS A VERY SOFT METAL
IT'S AN IDEAL PLACE FOR OUR RED AND BLUE TEAMS TO TRADE
KING SAUL'S DAUGHTER WHO MARRIED DAVID AND MY MOTHER THOUGHT IT WAS A MARVELLOUS NAME AND I WASN'T
IT OPENS UP LIKE THAT
I THINK IT'S A NICE LOT
THIS IS AN EXPERIENCE I WILL REMEMBER FOR A VERY
NOT SOPHISTICATED NOR MANUFACTURED PRODUCT LIKE THIS
AH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THOUSAND ACRES THAT ARE A SORT OF LIVING RECORD OF THE CHANGES WE'VE MADE TO OUR LANDSCAPE
THOUSAND OF THESE BOTTLE OVENS
LAYER UPON LAYER OF MUD WAS BURIED
WATERPROOF AND PERFECT FOR KEEPING THE RAIN OUT OF YOUR HOUSE
WITH ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE CRAMMED INTO JUST A FEW SQUARE KILOMETRES
AND LIKE LOTS OF AMERICANS AND EUROPEANS
THE TREE GETS RID OF THE DIRT AND ALWAYS HAS SOME CLEAN PORES TO BREATHE THROUGH
AND THAT WAS JUST ONE OF THE PROBLEMS
THIS IS THE JOHN SNOW PUB IN SOHO
NAMED AFTER A VICTORIAN GENT WHO BECAME SUSPICIOUS WHEN FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED OF CHOLERA
THE OUTBREAK OF CHOLERA DIED AWAY AND HE PROVED ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT THE DISEASE WAS CARRIED IN
SO WHERE'S THE WATER GONE
BECAUSE THE PATH OF THE THAMES WAS ALTERED
ITS BANKS WERE WALLED UP TO CONTAIN THE WATERS AND TO HELP RELIEVE LONDON OF ITS FOUL
WHEN WE THOUGHT LITTLE ABOUT POISONING OURSELVES AND THE ENVIRONMENT
BOTH MANMADE AND NATURAL
THE CORPORATION OF LONDON PRESERVED THEM IN WHAT WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST CONSERVATION PROGRAMME
THEY HAD BEEN RELEASED AND SNATCHED FROM PRISON BY MY WIFE EDITH
AND TO ENSURE COMPLETE SECRECY
YOUR VOICE REMINDS ME OF MY BOYHOOD ON A FARM IN BAVARIA
AT GREAT PERSONAL RISK
IN THE WOODS OR FIELDS
TAKES PLACE IN THE POOL
EACH TEAM HAS CHOSEN THEIR PLAYERS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE SHOW WHERE THE DOGS TAKE THE LEAD
WHO IS A GOLDEN LABRADOR
THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY EIGHT MILLION DOGS IN THIS COUNTRY AND TONIGHT
OR SHOULD I SAY SERVE
A TENNIS BALL INTO THE POOL
I NEED SOMETHING TO CALM ME DOWN
SUBTLE AND THAT ALWAYS MAKES ME SMILE
THE TEAM WITH THE HIGHEST SCORE AT THE END OF THE ROUND WINS
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
THE BEST WAY TO FUNDRAISE IS BY GETTING SPONSORED TO ENTER AN EVENT AT THE SPORT RELIEF GAMES
THERE ARE PROJECTS FUNDED BY SPORT RELIEF ALL OVER THE WORLD TRYING TO CHANGE LIVES FOR THE BETTER
NOW IT'S TIME TO PLAY OUR THIRD GAME
WHICH DEMONSTRATES A CANINE'S REMARKABLE SENSE OF SMELL AND CLEVER SKILLS OF DETECTION
WITHIN OUR OWN CELLS
IN SECTIONS OF CHEMICAL CODE KNOWN AS GENES
INVISIBLE TO THE HUMAN EYE
YET OF AN ENERGY AND NATURE THAT ALLOWED IT TO PASS STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HUMAN BODY
SHO ONTO A PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATE
IT WAS NOTED THAT JUST BECAUSE MOST OF THE X-RAYS PASSED THROUGH LIVING TISSUE
OPERATIONS LIKE THIS ONE ARE INCREDIBLY DELICATE PROCEDURES
BUT IT ONLY UNDERLINES HOW MUCH MORE THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS COMPLEX SET OF DISEASES
I WAS SCREENED FOR BOWEL CANCER
BUT MY EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN ME THAT CANCER REALLY IS A GAME OF CHANCE
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM
IT ONLY TAKES MINUTES
AND YOU NEVER KNOW
HEALTHY CELLS UNHARMED
SO THAT WAS LIKE
AND SO IT WAS IT WAS A SHOCK BUT
I'D RATHER THEM DO OUT CALLS AND COME TO ME
THE ONE IN AMSTEAD
IT WAS ONE AT A TIME
A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF RUNNING INTO SOMEONE
IT REALLY PUTS YOU OFF
I SPEAK OPENLY ABOUT SEX WITH MY FRIENDS
THEY FIND IT EASIER
EXCITING ASSUME THAT MANY
PEOPLE WOULD TAKE THAT AS MEANING THAT THEY CAN'T GET SEX UNLESS THEY PAY FOR IT
AND I WORKED FOR AN INSURANCE COMPANY AS WELL AT THE SAME TIME
I CAN'T SEE HIM
BECAUSE I CAN BE DANCING AROUND
BUTTON I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE ENJOYING IT
SO I JUST SORT OF DID A BLOG SAYING I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT
AS MUCH AS OBVIOUSLY I DO THIS FOR THE MONEY
THEY THEY JUST THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I CAN'T JUST USE MY BRAIN AND WORK IN AN OFFICE
THEY JUST DON'T THINK IT'S KIND OF
BUT MY FRIENDS AND THAT
DON'T SEE ME IF YOU'RE GOING TO THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND THE WHOLE HOUR
IT'S NOT FOR EVERYONE
CHARLOTTE'S MADE NINETY GRAND FROM WEBCAMMING ALONE IN THE PAST TWO YEARS
WHICH JUST BLEW MY MIND
AND I THINK THAT THAT FIGURE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF
JUST BECAUSE IT CAN BE SO
HAVING A ONE LET STAND
BUT SEX WORKERS DON'T REALLY HAVE A VOICE AND THEY CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE A VOICE THAT ANYBODY
AND PEOPLE HAVE THIS PERCEPTION YOU KNOW THAT PROSTITUTION IS ALL ABOUT SEX
IT'S GOT TO BE RICH PICKINGS FOR US
FOR TODAY'S TEAMS THEY NEED IMAGINE NO MORE
ENERGY FLOWS ALL THE TIME UNLESS SOMETHING BLOCKS IT OR STOPS IT
NOW AS THE BELL WAS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT IT'S STYLISH
WHICH IS ART DECO
FIFTY FOR A PAIR WITH ONE COMPLETELY SMASHED
I WONDER WHETHER THEY MIGHT JUST TAKE TWENTY
THIS STUFF WAS SMASHED UP AND REMOVED
LET'S FIND OUT RIGHT NOW
I THOUGHT MEN OF STYLE
IT WAS BUILT TO TELL THE STORY OF HOW WE DEPEND ON THE NATURAL WORLD
AND HOW NATURE IS AFFECTED BY OUR ACTIONS
AND IT'S THAT STORY
MORE THAN ANY OTHER
SOME HAVE EVEN DUBBED IT THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD
WHEN THE FLOORUPTS WITH A SEA OF BLUEBELLS
BUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
BRITISH WOODLANDS WERE IN CRISIS
THERE WAS LESS FOREST IN NINETEEN HUNDRED THAN THERE HAD BEEN FOR TEN
THERE'S ONE MORE CREATURE THAT THRIVES IN THESE PINE FORESTS
IT'S ONE OF OUR MOST ATTRACTIVE AND BEST LOVED ANIMALS
TWO METRES OF SOLID CONCRETE
BUT THE COLD WAR HAS ENDED
AND THE CRUISE MISSILES LEFT MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO
BUT OVER THE LAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS
NOW IT'S PRODUCING THAT MUCH A WEEK
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FARM'S INCOME AND PROVES THAT YOU CAN FARM TO PROFIT BOTH PEOPLE
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE HOLES IN THE GROUND
EVERYONE SHOULD BE A WINNER LESS THREAT FROM FLOODING
ALONG WITH MANY OTHER UNIQUE FENLAND SPECIES
THIS LITTLE CHAP FACES EITHER DEATH
OR AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY FROM HOME
IT'S ALL PART OF A GROWING TREND TO ENRICH OUR LANDSCAPE
YOU SEE ME ALL DRESSED UP LIKE A BALDING PENGUIN
I WILL BE VERY UNPOPULAR IN THE VILLAGE IT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR ME
I AM CAUGHT BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP
I DO NOT WANT TO BECOME A WIDOW
THERE WAS A HUGE BANG
HE LOST HIS SENSES
YOU CHOOSE THE COLOURS
IF I GET THAT MEDAL
BUT I COULDN'T SAY SO
I HAVEN'T YET WAS RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM BERLIN TO GIVE THE AWARD
NOW THAT I' BACK IN CHARGE
STAY HERE AND LOOK AFTER THE CAFE UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER
I HAD BETTER GET INTO THE HABIT
IT IS TERRIBLE FOR ME
I WOULD NEED AN OVERPOWERING REASON TO DOUBLE CROSS THE RESISTANCE
I AM NOT MYSELF
SOMETHING FUNNY IS GOING ON
BUT FOR CENTURIES WE'VE LOOKED TO THE CONTINENT FOR TRADE AND TRAVEL
LITTLE PIECES OF EUROPE HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY TO OUR SHORES
LIKE BLACK FOREST WOODCARVING
AND WHAT SHOULD YOU BE LOOKING OUT FOR
JUST LIKE THE BRITISH
IF YOU WANT TO GO
IT IS QUALITY BECAUSE THEY SPECIALISE IN THAT PARTICULAR GENRE
THEY WERE GERMAN MANUFACTURERS
NOT ONLY DID THEY MAKE THESE WONDERFUL UM DULL FACES AND
WHAT CONSTITUTES A EUROPEAN CLASSIC
AND BAARIAN THE WONDERFUL CARVED CUCKOO CLOCKS
THERE WERE LOADS OF GERMAN CLOCK MANUFACTURERS
MENE WAS WELL KNOWN
ONE SOLD RECENTLY SEVENTEEN
WITH AN OIL PAINTING
IT'S OFTEN EASIER TO PUT RIGHT
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A SIMPLE
SMALL HOLE IN A CANVAS
WHEN WE LOOKED AT THAT PAIR
SPELTER IS A SORT OF TINNY QUALITYITY I DO THAT BECAUSE I TING MY RING ON THINGS
AND YOU CAN TELL BY THE THE SOUND
IT'S ALSO MORE LIGHTWEIGHT AND IT ALSO IT'S AH IT'S A WHITE METAL RATHER THAN A YELLOW
IF YOU GIVE A LITTLE SCRATCH IN AN OBVIOUSLY IN AN UNSEEN PLACE
IT'LL COME UP YELLOW
IT'LL COME UP WHITE
AND THESE THESE MYSTERY CLOCKS
WERE ONE OF THOSE
BACCARAT AND SAINT LOUIS
BOTH IN THE ALSACE LORRAINE REGION
DURING THIS TIME
WE HAD DESKS QUITE SIMILAR
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING WISE TO THAT
SO WHAT CAN BE DONE
SOMETHING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FROM THIS AREA
AND IF NOTHING ELSE
IT IS WORTH TRYING TO NEGOTIATE
BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY AMENABLE TO NEGOTIATION
NOT TO EVERYONE'S TASTE
THE STAND AND BOWL AND THEN THE DECANTER AS WELL IN HERE
WHICH IS UNBELIEVABLE
YOU CANNOT GET A ONE OFF SUIT ANYWHERE FOR THIRTY
WHICH ISN'T TO EVERYBODY'S TASTE
THAT'S NOT JUST A ONE OFF
BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT YOU BRING IN SOMETHING THAT TAKES US ALL BY SURPRISE
BUT I WOULD JUST SAY TO YOU
I ALWAYS DO BUSMAN'S HOLIDAYS MYSELF
IT ISN'T REALLY THAT
THAT'S THE SORT OF ENGLISH VERSION BUT
AND THEY'RE QUALITY THINGS
AH WE MAY THINK WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE BEST EUROPE HAS TO OFFER
YOU WANT SOMETHING MADE
YOU WANT IT MADE BY THE BEST
AND IF NOT THE BEST
CERTAINLY THE SECOND BEST
YOU DON'T WANT IT JUST KNOCKED OUT
YOU WANT TO SAY TO PEOPLE ROUND THE DINING TABLE
BUT THINK AGAIN
UM I HAD SPOKEN TO BEFORE THE SALE
SHE HAD RATHER POOH POOHED IT
I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED
AND THEN PROCEEDED TO SIT IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM AND BID HER SOCKS OFF
IN THE SAME WAY
AND MUSICAL CAMERAS AS WELL
THEYRE FANTASTIC ENGINEERING IN EVERYTHING THEY PRODUCED
THE MOST FAMOUS NAME IN CAMERAS
A REGULAR TO THE VALUATION DAYS UP IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND
SHE HAD A LOT TO TELL KATELESS ABOUT A VERY INTERESTING PAIR OF FRENCH BROOCHES BACK IN
WHICH IS NOVELTY SALT AND PEPPER POTS
ZIP ROUND THE ROOM
WELL THAT'S THE BEST THING ABOUT COLLECTING IT'S A NEVER ENDING PROCESS
YOU SELL SOMETHING
YOU BUY SOMETHING
ALWAYS TRADE UPWARDS
BRING IT ALONG TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY
WE HAVE TAKEN THEIR PLACE
SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT RUNNING A BAR
HE WAS A BOOK MAKER
HOW'S YOUR FRENCH
IF ONLY MY OLD CH CRATREE WERE HERE
IT'S A MONK AND A MONKS
MICHELLE IS LOVID WITH INGER
YOU ARE WITH FRIENDS
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO REPORT PERSONS MISSING MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
PRESS LIFT BUTTONS
INSIDE OF WHICH IS A NUMBER
JUMPING AND GETTING WET
THE REASON WE ARE HERE TONIGHT IS TO SUPPORT SPORT RELIEF
YOUR DONATIONS MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE TO THE LIVES OF PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE UK AND AROUND THE WORLD
AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT
THANK YOU SO MUCH
NO TIME TO REST AS WE PUSH STRAIGHT ON WITH OUR THIRD GAME
NOW TEETH AND JAWS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATE ME BECAUSE THEY REVEAL SO MANY OF THE SECRETS BEHIND THE
WE ARE NOT OUTSIDE OF OUR ENVIRONMENT
MINE DO THE SAME
AND WE REALLY HAVE TO CHEW HARD TO MAKE OUR FOOD WORK FOR US
NEW ONES ARE PUSHED FORWARD FROM THE BACK OF THE MOUTH
AS THE LAST ONE IS WORN DOWN AND IS FINALLY LOST
THE WALRUS HAS THESE ENORMOUS TUSKS
BUT WHEN SCIENTISTS LOOKED IN THE STOMACHS OF WALRUSES
BUT THE ORIENTATION
THE NUMBER OF BONES
WAY BEFORE WE EXISTED AS HOMO SAPIEN
NOW I'VE GOT ONE IN MY HIP
THEY PLAY GOOD MUSIC
I REALLY HAVEN'T SLEPT SINCE I MOVED HERE
THE PRINCE GETS CURSED BY THE WITCH
BUT HE IS ALSO IN A DEAD END JOB
IT'S NOT HAPPENING
IT'S DIED DOWN A BIT BUT AT THE TIME HE HAD QUITE A STRONG ACCENT
SO I MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT HE WAS SAYING AND CONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS
HE IS ACTUALLY A MALE AND THEREFORE COULDN'T ACTUALLY BE PREGNANT AT THE TIME
LET'S HAVE A QUICK SQUINT AS TO HOW THEY GOT ON
I HOPE THEY'RE THERE AND READY FOR YOU TO BUY
HAVE A NICE CUP OF TEA
VIA THE OBJECTS THAT YOU FIND
THIS COLLECTABLE IS MADE BY THE ALUM BAY GLASS COMPANY
ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS LATER
FROM THE QUALITY OF IT
TO BE A LITTLE SOUVENIR PIECE OF SOME DESCRIPTION
THERE ARE LOTS OF BREWERIES
THE BIG NUMBER FOR THEM IS THE FIRE SCREEN
GAVE THEIR EXPERT ONE HUNDRED
IF THEY'VE GOT THE RIGHT NAME ON THEM
I DON'T FIND IT INTRIGUING ENOUGH TO CONTEMPLATE SPENDING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED POS
WE DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW
OR AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE
AND IS SUFFERING FROM DELAYED SHOCK
HAVE RETURNED SAFELY FROM OUR TRIP TO LONDON WHERE WE HAD FLED TO AVOID BEING SHOT BY THE COMMUNIST
I AM NOT MYSELF TODAY
I DID NOT ENJOY MY SHORT TIME IN ENGLAND
MY RESISTANCE GIRLS I SAW HALFWAY THROUGH SIX TELEGRAPH POLES
WHEN IT IS DARK
WE ALWAYS NEED POUTOS
AND USE IT FOR OUR OWN PROPAGANDA PURPOSES
MY LIPS ARE SEALED I PROMISE
RENE YOU HAVE IMPECCABLE TASTE
MY PILLOW CAN ALWAYS USE THEM
NOW LOOK VERY CAREFULLY
I BECAME AN APPRENTICE WINDOW DRESSER
CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF
I WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH YOU
UNTIL RELATIVELY RECENTLY
EVERYTHING WAS MADE BY HAND FURNITURE
THEY ARE SOMETIMES VERY SYMBOLIC
YOU FIND HEARTS
YOU COULD ALMOST SEE THE GUY IN HIS SHED MAKING THEM
AH WATCHING THE THE PLANES GOING OVERHEAD
VERY BEAUTIFUL THINGS
IF YOU KNOW A LOCAL MAKER PRODUCING QUALITY ITEMS THAT YOU THINK WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME
THEN WHY NOT INVEST
AT THE END OF THE DAY
IF IT DOESN'T GO UP IN VALUE
AT LEAST YOU BROUGHT SOMETHING THAT YOU LOVE AND IT'S GOING TO PUT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE
BECAUSE THEY HAD TO SHARE THEIR TOOLS
GET IT OUT OF THE WAY
YOU COULDN'T HAVE CLUTTER
BECAUSE SHAKER FURNITURE HASN'T JUST INFLUENCED FURNITURE DESIGNERS
BUT ALL DESIGNERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
THOMAS PLANTS A MAN WHO LOVES TO LOOK AT ALL THE BEAUTIFUL ANTIQUES YOU BRING TO OUR VALUATION
IF IT'S A PERFECT PIECE
BRANM OR BARUM POTTERY WAS MAKING A LOT OF MONEY
IT'S LIKE A LOT OF THINGS
THE DEEP PURPLES
IT OBVIOUSLY MEANS THEY ARE NOT PRODUCING ANY MORE WARES
SO IN THAT INSTANCE
IF THERE IS A FINITE SUPPLY OF SOMETHING
THERE ARE SOME OF THE BIG NAMES THAT MAYBE SOME OF THE VIEWERS WOULD HAVE HEARD OF
SUCH AS BERNARD LEACH
WORKING EXTREMELY HARD
SO I QUITE LIKE THE STORY BEHIND IT AS WELL
IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY
A GROUP OF PEOPLE FORMED A MOVEMENT LATER TO BE KNOWN AS THE ARTS AND CRAFTS MOVEMENT
WHICH CHAMPIONED TRADITIONAL SKILLS AND METHODS TO MAKE BEAUTIFUL HANDCRAFTED THINGS
AND ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME
A CHAP CALLED EDMUND ELTON DISCOVERED A PASSION FOR POTTERY JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM WHERE THOMAS PLANT
WHO WAS A BIT OF A BLACK SHEEP
HE ENJOYED POTTING SO MUCH HE MADE SOME GREAT ERRORS BUT ALSO MADE SOME GREAT GLAZES
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT HANDCRAFTED ITEMS
EACH ONE OF THEM IS UNIQUE
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONALITY WHICH GIVES THEM EXTRA APPEAL
SO IF YOU'RE HUNGRY FOR MORE
I STILL HAVE NOT RECOVERED FROM THE PICNIC
ORGANISED BY GENERAL VOLINKEROV TO SHOW THE HUMAN SIDE OF THE GERMAN ARMY
THEY WERE UP A NEARBY TELEGRAPH POLE WHICH HAD BEEN PARTIALLY SAWN THROUGH
I HAVE HEARD RUMOURS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN CONSORTING WITH WOMEN OF THE OPPOSITE SEX
AND THAT GOES FOR YOUR MIDGET FRIENDS
ALL MEN WILL BE AN ANTI CLIMAX
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS FINISHED
THE LOVE AFFAIR OF THE CENTURY IS OVER
WHICH COULD BE OF INTEREST
I SHALL GO AS A DEBONAIR MAN ABOUT TOWN
THE DECISION OF THE WIFE OF THE EDITOR IS FINAL
WHERE WE HAVE REACHED THE ALL IMPORTANT SEMIFINALS
WE'RE READY FOR OUR FIRST GAME
LET'S SEE FLIGHT AND LEO IN ACTION IN GLORIOUS SLOW MO
BOTH HERE IN THE UK AND ACROSS THE WORLD'S POOREST COMMUNITIES
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT
THANK YOU SO MUCH
THE COURSE WILL BE COMPLETED ONE DOG AT A TIME
AND IF AN OBSTACLE IS REFUSED OR INCORRECTLY CLEARED
THEY'LL HEAR THIS SOUND
YOU AND YOUR DOG CAN SUPPORT SPORT RELIEF IN MANY WAYS
THEY SAY IT THE OTHER WAY ROUND
THEY SAY HAIR BLACK
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IF IT'S MORE THAN ONE THING YOU'RE DESCRIBING
WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
WHAT COULD BE MORE DELIGHTFUL
SO LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
DEGAS LOST HIS SIGHT
I AM DISGUISED AS AN ONION SELLER
IT IS NOT A GOOD MORNING
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION BUT I SHALL TURN A BLIND EYE
BROKE INTO MY SAFE AND STOLE A VALUABLE PAINTING
WHAT ABOUT VAN THE GARRISON COMMANDER ENJOYING AN EVENING OUT AT THE LOCAL CAFE ENJOYING FOOD
WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE
BUT I AM OF A CERTAIN AGE
AND I AM OF THAT CERTAIN AGE WHEN IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY S AND YOU WENT ON HOLIDAY
AND SEASIDES WOULD HAVE FAIRGROUNDS
AND FAIRGROUNDS HAD RIDES
IT SORT OF DOES REMIND ME OF THOSE CHILDHOOD HOLIDAYS
I THINK YOU WANT THE BEST OF THE BEST
THIS BARBIE WAS THE BEST OF THE BEST
WITH ITS THREE WIGS
EITHER WAS FABULOUS
AND SOME OF THOSE EARLY FIGURES
PARTICULARLY THE RARER ONES
IN MINT CONDITION WITH ORIGINAL BOXES
TRY AND FIND A NAME THAT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF
THERE WEREN'T MANY OF THESE MADE
MADE IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
AND BECAUSE OF THAT
AS SOON AS IT BECOMES AN OBJECT TO BE COLLECTED
BECAUSE EVERYBODY THINKS
AND THEN FROM THAT NICHE
THE RARITY OF THE MOULD THAT THE HEAD IS MADE FROM
COSTUMES AS WELL
IT'S THE CLOTHES
ARE THEY IN THE ORIGINAL CLOTHES
HAS THE HAPPY CUT
NOBODY THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE ANY RELEVANCE
NOBODY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A COLLECTORS' ITEM IN THE FUTURE
IN THE SAME WAY
NOBODY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OF ANY VALUE
A PIECE LACKING
WARM FEELINGS OF NOSTALGIA
IT'S QUITE SEXY
IT DOESN'T HAVE A GREAT FINANCIAL VALUE
AND THERE IS A LESSON FOR US ALL THERE SELLING SOMETHING AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME CAN PAY
I SUPPOSE I BECAME AWARE OF ASTONS IN A WAY WITH JAMES BOND
SO IT'S ALL IN
I DO SELL THESE
SHE WAS QUITE PROLIFIC AND THEY EXPECT TO FIND ITEMS IN PERFECT ORDER
SO HAVING THAT LETTER WITH IT
HE WAS SIGNING THINGS ALL DAY LONG
AND I THINK HE EVEN GOT TO A STAGE WHERE HE CHARGED YOU A FEW QUID JUST FOR A SIGNATURE
IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP A RECORD OF WHERE FAMILY POSSESSIONS CAME FROM
ON THE SIDE OF A LIMITED EDITION PRINT
HIS SIGNATURE WOULD MAKE IT WORTH BETWEEN FIVE AND
ASSUMING YOU KNOW
TALK TO RELATIVES
RUMMAGE AROUND IN BOXES OF OLD PAPERWORK LOOKING FOR INVOICES
BILLS OF SALE AND RECEIPTS
AND ALSO PHOTOGRAPHS
AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING
AND I SEE ALSO A LETTER
I WOULD SEE IF FOR TWO WEEKS
THIS IS WHY HE WAS THERE
THIS IS THE PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM BEING THERE
AND THIS IS THE PROVENANCE OF WHERE IT CAME FROM
WHEN HE WHEN HE PASSED AWAY
THAT'S WHEN HE WAS MOST IN THE MEDIA
FRESH TO MARKET
YOU'RE TALKING PREMIER LEAGUE
AND THE COLLECTORS WILL PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE RIGHT CAMERA
IF THE SIGNATURES WERE ON THE FRONT
THAT THE FIRST PROTOTYPE CAME OUT
COMPACT CAMERA FOR TAKING LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHS
YOU HAD TO PUT A TOWEL OVER YOUR HEAD
PORTABLE AND GOOD QUALITY
BASED ON SIMILAR ONES THAT WE'VE HAD
LOOK FOR VERY FINE QUALITY DRAFTSMANSHIP AND FOR TRAINS AND FOR GLOOMINESS AND FOR NORTHERN
THEY BOTH HAD ONE
THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT WORRIES ME
PROBABLY A COUPLE OF THOUSAND POUNDS AND SO
IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO HEAR THAT FLOG IT
WAS ABLE TO HELP OUT ALBEIT IN A SMALL WAY
IF YOU'VE GOT ANY UNLOVED TOYS YOU WANT TO SELL OR ANY OTHER ANTIQUES OR COLLECTIBLES FOR THAT
YOU KNOW WHERE TO COME
BUY SOME ANTIQUES AND JOIN US AGAIN SOON FOR MORE TRADE
THINGS HAVE GONE FROM BAD TO WORSE
I AM A DEAD MAN
IS THERE NOT SOME WAY I CAN SHOW MY APPRECIATION
MY FACE STARING OUT OF ALL THE NEWS STANDS AND UNDER THE TITLE
THE SPIRIT OF NOUVION REPRESENTS STRENGTH
THE MONEY FROM THE CAFE WILL KEEP YOU IN COMFORT
IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF YOU GOT MADAM EDITH INTO HIDING
IN CASE SHE FALLS FOR HIS IRRESISTIBLE CHARM
IF I CAN SAVE ANYONE FROM THE TORTURE OF MATRIMONY
WE CAN DROP THE BARRELS WITH THE AIRMEN INTO IT
I AM HIS TWIN BROTHER FROM
SHE WILL UNLOCK THE INTERCONNECTING DOOR
AFTER CREATING A DIVERSION
I HOPE THIS PLAN WORKS
AFTER WEEKS OF FUN AND GAMES
WE'VE REACHED THE SECOND SEMIFINAL
WE'VE REACHED THE BUSINESS END OF THE SERIES AND AT STAKE IS A PLACE IN TOMORROW'S GRAND FINAL
TWO OF OUR BEST TEAMS WILL BE COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THREE DOG FRIENDLY GAMES
THEIR HAPPINESS IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY
WITH TENSION MOUNTING
WE ARE READY FOR OUR FIRST GAME
THE MONEY BEING RAISED WILL CHANGE THE LIVES OF SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD
NOW WE HAVE OUR LAST TWO TO PLAY
IF AN OBSTACLE IS REFUSED OR INCORRECTLY CLEARED
YOU CAN FIND ALL THE DETAILS
OF ALL THE DAYS
WE THOUGHT YOU SOMEONE ELSE
SHE'S GOT THAT DRIVE
IF SOMEBODY CHALLENGES TO SOMETHING
THIS BLUE SKY
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT
SHE'S BEEN AT SOME VERY
IF THERE'S A DEVICE
YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF KEEPING THIS PRIZE WINNING CHUMP OUT OF HARM'S WAY
THERE WAS NO REAL HARM DONE
I'M A LIEUTENANT COLONEL
THIS IS OUT OF HARM'S WAY
THAT'S NOT EVEN THE FIRST RULE
IT'S SO FUCKING OBVIOUS
THEN COME AND SEE ME
CHEESE GOES OFF
JUST TO KEEP HIS MAJORITY AT THE NEXT ELECTION
AND THE GREAT MAN ONCE SAID
WHICH IS SOUND ADVICE FOR OUR TEAMS TODAY
I'M AN EDUCATIONAL CONSULTANT
I TRAIN TEACHERS
I SUPPORT TEACHERS WHO WANT TO IMPROVE THEIR PRACTICE
SO THE DERBYSHIRE ANTIQUES ADMIRATION SOCIETY
ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
AND ALSO THE BRONED FIGURE
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
IT COULD BE YOURS FOR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PO
I THINK YOU MIGHT GET A FIVE OF PROFIT
RIGHT NOW THOUGH
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
BUT WE'LL GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT ANYWAY
YOU ARE MINUS TWENTY SEVEN
YOU WERE SO REALISTIC
THE LIVES OF THE AIRMEN MAY DEPEND ON IT
BUT IT HAS BEEN LAID UP SINCE IT BROKE DOWN IN NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
I DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE MUCH CHOICE
IS IT WISE FOR ME TO ACCEPT
WHAT DO YOU SAY
YOU ARE VERY FRIENDLY WITH THE COLONEL
SO YOU WILL INVITE HIM OUT
IT IS THE FALLEN MADONNA
I WORK WITH THE RESISTANCE
BUT HE IS A FORTUNE TELLER
I WILL TRY MY BEST
ANYBODY YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER
WE HAVE REACHED THE CLIMAX OF OUR SERIES
AND IT'S AN OLYMPIC SHOWDOWN
AND THE DOG BISCUITS BACKSTAGE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
IT'S TIME TO INTRODUCE OUR FIRST TEAM OF FINALISTS
AND BIT OF A I THINK SHE LIKES ME
REALLY LIKES ME NOW
AND WELCOME TO THE GRAND FINAL OF SPORT RELIEF'S TOP DOG
AFTER THREE WEEKS
AND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE BOWLS OF DOG FOOD
AND QUICK REACTIONS
WE'VE BEEN WATCHING DOGS JUMPING
FETCHING AND LEAPING IN THE WATER
BRINGING HOME THAT IMPOSTER WILL BE WORTH NOTHING AT ALL
REMEMBER IT'S ONE GAME APIECE
SO LET'S SEE WHAT THAT DOES TO THE OVERALL SCORE
WE'VE REACHED OUR FINAL GAME OF THE SERIES
ONE LAST HURDLE
SEVERAL OF THEM
NOT TO MENTION A TUNNEL AND A FERRY
IT'S THE MOMENT OF DESTINY FOR OUR TEAMS
BUT ONLY ONE CAN EMERGE AS THE OVERALL WINNER
THE GIANT'S CAUSEWAY HAS BEEN REMOVED
SO YOU KNOW THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE TO BEAT
RELIEF THE EXCITEMENT IS FAR FROM OVER
AS SPORT RELIEF'S BIG NIGHT IS ABOUT TO KICK OFF ON BBC ONE
IT PROMISES TO BE TRULY SPECTACULAR
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A CONTENDER IN THE NEXT SERIES
COMES FROM VIOLAS
NOT A GRAND PLANT OR FANCY
ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR GARDEN
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GROW MASSES OF RHODODENDRONS AND AZALEAS
HE'S IN NORTHUMBERLAND
I DID HAVE AN IDEA
ANYTHING THAT CAN BREATHE
YOU MAY NOT HAVE ANY TENDER PLANTS TO PROTECT
COMING HOME FROM SCHOOL
IS BUILD UP FOR HIBERNATION
THEY CAN HAVE A DRINK
THEY CAN TOP UP
SO IF YOU'VE ALL GOT BUIES IN YOUR GARDEN
BUT I FIND IF YOU DO THAT
AND THE BUDS BLOOM IN JULY
BY DOING THEM A LITTLE BIT LATER
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DO IT AT THE END OF WINTER
AS WELL AS ANY OTHER DETAILS OF TODAY'S PROGRAMME FROM OUR WEBSITE
THEY WERE ANONYMOUS WORKMEN
THOSE ARE THE WORDS IN THE CONTRACT
A VERY SPECIAL ARTWORK
BUT TOROIANO WAS NO MEDIEVAL CRAFTSMAN
HE WAS JUST TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD
HE CAME WITH NO FRIENDS AND FAMILY
AND STARTED THINKING ABOUT THEMSELVES AS INDIVIDUALS WITH THEIR OWN UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS
THEIR OWN UNIQUE HOPES AND FEARS
THE MOST MYSTERIOUS THING
THE MOST FAMOUS THING
I THINK IN OXFORD
NOT JUST ONE OF THESE SUNDIALS WILL TELL THE TIME
BUT ALL OF THEM
JOHN DAMIAN'S FLIGHT COULD BE SEEN AS A MISERABLE FAILURE
ITS GREATEST PAINTER HAD COME FROM SWITZERLAND
HE IS FAMOUS FOR HAVING HAD A SECRET AFFAIR WITH ANNE BOLEYN
THE RENAISSANCE HAD TYPICALLY BEEN ELEGANT AND REFINED
SO WHEN WE DID THE RENAISSANCE
HE WAS ON THE BANKS OF THE THAMES WHEN HE SAW A MAN PREPARING A BOAT FOR TRAVEL
BUT NOT THOMAS WYATT
IT WAS SWEET AND IT WAS PASSIONATE
AND THOMAS WYATT WAS SMITTEN
MANY PEOPLE THINK HE ACTUALLY INVENTED THE IDEA OF THE RENAISSANCE
AND YET I ASK HEALTH
IT WOULD INSTEAD HAVE A SOLID AND EARTHY REALITY
FOX WAS A MAN ON A MISSION
I THINK ITS REAL GENIUS WAS NOT JOHN FOX'S TEXT
BUT FOX AND DAY DID THEIR HOMEWORK
LITERATE AND ILLITERATE ALIKE
ONE ENGLISH COMPOSER CAME BACK WITH A SONG
NOT FOR THIRTY VOICES
SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT
LIFE'S NO PICNIC FOR THEM EITHER IN FAST RUNNING WATER
IT'S ANOTHER INSECT
REFRESHING BREEZE TO BLOW THROUGH
THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE IT RUNS OVER CHALK
WHEN WATER FLOWS OVER SOFT ROCK
SO IF THE PLANTS CAN'T GROW
AND LIKE ALL BIRDS THAT LIVE IN REEDS AND TALL UNDERGROWTH LIKE THIS
THE COAST IS THE START OF A NEW LIFE
BUT WE SEE WHAT WE CAN DO
NOT IN MY HOUSE
IT'S TIME FOR HIM AND IT'S TIME'S UP FOR OUR TEAMS
DOWN IN SOMERSET IN CREWCUR
WITH RICHARD KAR
WE'VE BEEN TRADING WITH NORTH AFRICA
BUT THE FURTHEST REACHES OF THE ORIENT HAVE BEEN CLOSED TO ALL BUT A FEW INTREPID TRAVELLERS UNTIL
BUT ITEMS FROM THOSE LANDS REGULARLY TURN UP AT OUR VALUATION DAYS
BRITAIN ONCE RULED THE WAVES WITH MILITARY MIGHT
SO WITH A LITTLE BIT OF DEDICATED RESEARCH
THERE'S A PERCEPTION AT THE MOMENT THAT EVERYTHING'S CHINESE
CHINESE AND CERTAINLY THE CHINESE MARKET IS REALLY
THEY WOULD HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLY MORE
A LITTLE BIT SCARCE AND RARER
YOU'VE GOT TO CONSTANTLY READ UP ON THE SUBJECT
STUDY THE SUBJECT
AND RATHER THAN TWO VERY SIMILAR OBJECTS
PAIRS ALWAYS MAKE MORE
NOT JUST TWICE THE PRICE OF A SINGLE ONE BUT
BUT OFTEN THREE OR FOUR TIMES
THESE ARE VERY DELICATE OBJECTS AND THEY WILL SHOW SOME SIGNS OF WHERE IF THEY'RE ORIGINAL
THREE YEARS AGO
AS INDEED THE FAR EAST
YOU RANG JAMES UP
BUT IF BARBARA'S SPECTACULAR CHESS SET WAS ANYTHING TO GO BY
THEY ARE DEFINITELY WORTH LOOKING OUT FOR
DON'T COMPROMISE ON QUALITY
WHICH IS THE ENERGY
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO EXCITING
TO PICK UP THE STICKS ONCE AGAIN
OPEN YOUR BODY OUT
THE JAPANESE WILL COPY THE CHINESE
THE CHINESE WILL COPY THE JAPANESE
BUT THANK GOODNESS THEY HAVE
SIX FIGURES OR SO
IS IT THE RARITY
THE MATERIAL IT'S MADE FROM
IT JUST SCREAMED THE MEIJI PERIOD IN IN JAPAN
THE SUMMIT WAS ALWAYS BELIEVED TO BE WHAT STILL IS TO BE SACRED
THIS HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN IN PRIVATE HANDS FOR MANY YEARS
SO WHEN IT CAME TO THE MARKET
IT'S A WONDERFUL DISPLAY
AND THEY WERE DENIED THEIR CULTURE
THEY DESTROYED THEM
SOMETHING LIKE THESE SHOES
WHEN I WAS A BOY
I HAD ALL MY GOLDFISH IN THE POND
BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVELY LOW SIDES
UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR STUFF
IS IT A FISH BOWL
I'M SO GLAD THE SALE OF THOSE LOVELY THINGS MEANT THAT SANDRA COULD RETRACE SOME OF HER FATHER'S
BRING IT ALONG TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY
I HOPE YOU HAVE ENJOYED THE SHOW
THEY ARE VERY PROUD MEN
THEY LIKE TO WEAR THEIR OWN UNIFORM
LOOK HOW MUCH MORE SMART
WHEN I WAS IN AFRICA
HELP MOVE DOWN THE STAIRS
I'VE GOT AN IDEA
MEAN WHEN THEY GO DOWN IN THEIR TUNNEL
KEEPS THE MEN ON THEIR TOES
BUT I'M NOT AS YOUNG AS I WAS YOU KNOW
AND WE'RE GOING ONE BETTER
WE'RE GOING TO DIVE WITH A SHARK OUT IN THE BIG BLUE
WHILE WE'RE WAITING
UM CREATING ALMOST LIKE A VACUUM SUCTION POWER
AND THEN TWIRL AROUND
TODAY'S THE DAY
IT'S VERY SIMPLE
IT HAS TWO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRAS
TODAY WE'RE IN GREATER MANCHESTER
YOU NAME IT FACT THE LIST IS ENDLESS
THEY ALL COME FROM THIS AREA
READY FOR A VALUATION
EVERYBODY FROM MORRISSEY TO THE BEE GEES
AGAIN WITH DISCRETION ON THE SIX HUNDRED
CAN WE RECYCLE IT FOR TWO HUNDRED
AND I BET THEY'RE RIGHT HERE TODAY
NUMBER SIXTY TWO NELSON STREET
THIS WAS THE HOME OF A WOMAN WHO TIME MAGAZINE RECOGNISED AS ONE OF THE ONE HUNDRED MOST
SHE NOT ONLY CHANGED OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM BUT
SO THEY EMBARKED ON A COURSE OF MILITANT ACTION TO MAKE THE MPS SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT WHAT THE ORGANISATION ITSELF WAS ABOUT AND THAT
WHILE THE MEN WERE AWAY FIGHTING ON THE WESTERN FRONT
BUT ALSO WITH CONSERVATIONISTS
THAT WOULD BE THREE
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID
YEAH PEOPLE WILL BUY ONE TILE LIKE THAT
THEIR CHARACTERS AND THE WILDLIFE ARE BOUNCING BACK
TO SHOW YOU JUST HOW PERILOUS IT CAN BE
IN THE PAST ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YEARS NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO SHIPS HAVE BEEN WRECKED AROUND THE
AND WE DON'T TALK TO THEM
AND WE DON'T STROKE THEM
THAT'S IT FOR THIS WEEK
NEXT WEEK WE'LL BE IN COUNTY DURHAM WHERE MATT TRAVELS HOME TO HELP OUT HIS MUM ON MOTHER'S DAY AND
THE BRITISH MOTOR INDUSTRY FOUND THAT THE BRITISH SPORTS CAR
WHICH WAS A LOT OF MONEY THOSE DAYS
SO NOT BAD NOW
THE AUSTIN A FORTY DEVON
COMFORTABLE CARS FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY
SO YOU KNOW YOUD HAVE
AN ELECTRIC ROOF
BUT DURING AND AFTER THE WAR
HE SET OUT TO MAKE HIS OWN CARS
IN HIS OWN COMPANY
SAW THE HELI HUNDRED USING HIS ENGINE
AND DEMONSTRATE IT TO PEOPLE
OVER THE MGA WAS LAUNCHED
AND FERRARI WOULD WIN
WE'VE ALL HEARD THE PHRASE
THEY WERE ALL FIGHTING FOR THE SAME PEOPLE
CERTAINLY ONE OF THE GREATEST WINS
AH WE WE WERE VERY PROUD TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL CARS
THERE WAS ALWAYS A TEAM OF THREE OR FOUR OF THEM IN THE RALLIES
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO SIT WITH A GUY WHO WON THE FIRST BRITISH RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT
WE JUST THOUGHT OF OURSELVES AS RAISTS
I THINK IT WAS A TULIP RALLY
WHEN YOU BUILT YOUR OWN
AND THE RESULTS WERE TERRIBLE
AND IF ANYONE SAW YOU DRIVING THE RESULT
THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT YOU WERE TERRIBLE
IF YOU COULDN'T AFFORD THE FOUR
ONE OF HIS IDEAS WAS THAT THE THE BACKEND AND THE FRONT END WOULD BE IDENTICAL
AND ONLY THE MIDDLE BIT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
SHOVE IT ON THE FRONT
YOU'VE NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD
AND CERTAINLY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SPORTS CAR CHOICE
AND AT THE BACK
SO IF YOU HAD A SUITCASE
LIKE BEHIND THE SEAT
UNDERNEATH THE BACK
BECAUSE IT WAS SWEET
IT GAVE THAT HINT OF SEXUALITY
BUT IT WAS ACCESSIBLE
AND WHAT IT OFFERED WAS NOT THAT MUCH IN THE WAY OF PERFORMANCE
BUT A LOT OF EXCITEMENT
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WRONG WITH IT
A CAR THAT WAS BEING SOLD AT AN INCREDIBLE PRICE
THERE WERE ALWAYS ARGUMENTS THAT
CHAPS WHO WERE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DEPRIVED IN THE GENTLEMAN'S AREA WOULD NEED A BIG SPORTS
IS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE E TYPE
BUT THEY WEREN'T HAND BUILT
THEY WERE THROWN TOGETHER
I THINK WE UNDERSOLD IT
IT'S THE ONE WE AS HUMAN BEINGS HAVE HAVE MANUFACTURED
ONE OF THE BEST DESIGNERS AND ON BODY SHAPES
IT WAS ALL HANDS ON
YOU DIDN'T HAVE COMPUTERS DOING IT FOR YOU
YOU'VE GOT THIS GENERAL REACHING OUT FOR TECHNOLOGY
OVER THE SLIP ROAD
HE SOMETIMES LISTENS
DO YOU GIVE IT TO THE BOYS
SO I'VE BEEN GETTING SOME HELP FROM SOMEBODY WHO DOES
AND I'M ON MY WAY TO SEE HOW MY LITTLE DOG
SHE SEEMS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE AFTER AND
YOU'VE MADE THE PROMISE
FROM HIS ROOM UP THERE
AND IF HE SAW ANY
BALL GAMES THAT BROKE WINDOWS
BUT IT HAD THE TENDENCY TO FALL OVER
SO IN A DESIGN PROGRESSION
MADE OF WOOD PROBABLY
BECAUSE IT IS FULLY EXPECTED
AND IF IT HASN'T GOT ONE
SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WENT COMPLETELY BONKERS
AND THEN WE HAVE THE LETTER
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO ME
SO LOT OF LETTERS FROM QUEEN VICTORIA
HIS NAME WAS FREDERICK WEYMOUTH GIBBS
AND THIS WEEK'S ROGUES GALLERY COMES COURTESY OF OUR CERAMICS EXPERT
BY THE LOOKS OF IT
EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER
AND WE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A FONT
WHO'S THE GARDENER
THE SORT OF COLLECTOR THAT LIKES OLD OAK PERIOD OBJECTS
I THINK SHE'S GOT EXCEPTIONALLY GREEN FINGERS
I KIND OF WONDERED WHETHER THEY WERE OR NOT BUT
THEY WERE REALLY
WITH THE ORIGINAL CERTIFICATE AND ITS ORIGINAL TAG
THEN I SEE A FEW FLEAS
LIKE EVERYTHING IS OK
I'M TIRED OF YOU
MY JOB IS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
AND THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS ASK PEOPLE
I MEAN I'VE STRUCTURED MY WHOLE WORLD AROUND HIM
TO STAY OR TO COME OR ANY OTHER TRAINING WORD AND JUST EXIST WITH HIM
OF THERE BEING DANGER
ONE OF THE MOST ENDANGERED PEOPLE ON THE PLANET PROBABLY
DAILY DEATH THREAT
HOW DID THAT GO
I ONLY HAVE SIX EMPTY KENNELS
I'LL GET TWENTY FIVE DOGS IN EASY TODAY
SO MY KENNELS WILL FILL UP TODAY
I ONLY HAVE SO MUCH I CAN DO
WHEN HE WAS SICK
JUST LIKE TIME A DOG
BECAUSE OUR ANCESTORS BROUGHT HIS ANCESTORS HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
TO THE PEREGRINE
THE CITY IS A KIND OF HOME AWAY FROM HOME
ALBEIT MADE OF CONCRETE
ON WHICH IT CAN BUILD A NEST
LOTS OF LOFTY VANTAGE POINTS FROM WHICH IT CAN SURVEY THE SCENE
AND WHERE THEY COULD REPEL INVADERS
WHAT SCIENTISTS RECKON IS HAPPENING HERE IS THAT THIS ROBIN
LIKE ALL OTHERS
HAS ANNOUNCED THAT SHE IS PREGNANT
EDITH DOES NOT KNOW WHO THE FATHER IS
I HAVEN'T HEARD HER VOICE FOR THREE YEARS
WISHHU HERE
HIS NAME IS JUAN GARCIA
WELL BROADCAST WEDNESDAYS AFTER BREAKFAST TIME WITH NANOU
YOU ARE VERY QUIET
WELL IT WAS LIKE THIS
WE HAVE THE BATTERY
SHE CAN CLIMB UP THE CHIMNEY
THEY WILL BE GOING NOWHERE
WE WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THE KNOWLEDGE WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE ITEMS YOU'VE SHOWN US
MADE TO DECEIVE
WHETHER THAT'S TRUE OR NOT
IT DOES PAY TO BE ON YOUR GUARD
IF YOU'RE THINKING OF SPLASHING OUT SOME CASH ON SOME ANTIQUES
MAKE SURE WHAT YOU'RE BUYING IS AUTHENTIC
IF THE PRICE IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
DON'T ACT WITH YOUR HEART IF YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET IT WITH YOUR HEAD LATER
CIRCA SIXTEEN WHATEVER
WE TRY AND GET MOST THINGS RIGHT
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT
IT WAS A REPRODUCTION
BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY
AND YOU KNOW THE THE ORIGINALS COST MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
TO PICK ONE UP FOR THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED
IS IN YOUR BUDGET
AND IT WAS A VERY VISUAL CLOCK
YOU CAN GET GOOD REPRODUCTIONS
ONE OF THE GREAT MAKERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
IT'S JUST A REALLY DECENT QUALITY GERMAN WORKSHOP VIOLIN
BY THE VALUATION AND THE HAMMER PRICE
AND THAT'S THAT'S A REAL JOY
TEAM TO OFFER SOME SAGE WORDS OF ADVICE ON HOW TO AVOID BEING TAKEN
POUND BUT IF IT WAS THE REAL THING
THE SO CALLED YORKSHIRE CRITTERS
BASED IN KILBURN
AND I'M HERE TODAY TO SEE SOME OF HIS FURNITURE
I'M SO THRILLED TO SEE IT
AS A YORKSHIRE LAST
WHICH WAS ROBERT MOUSEMAN THOMPSON
BECAUSE YOU'LL NEVER FORGET THAT ONE
YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF YOU WANT TO TOUCH THEM AND SOAK IT ALL UP
IT WAS ONCE A FORTIFIED HOUSE
DAMAGE CAN DETRACT FROM AN ITEM'S APPEAL
YET IT'S TRUE TO SAY COLLECTORS PREFER AUTHENTICITY
THERE ARE ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST
SO IF YOU HAVEN'T QUITE YET MADE YOUR MIND UP
THE RESTORER HAD RESTORED THE MOVEMENT AND MADE IT WORK
WHICH IS WHAT YOU EXPECT THEM TO DO
DON'T EXPECT THEM TO BE WORKING
THEY'LL EITHER DO IT THEMSELVES OR THEY GET IT DONE PROFESSIONALLY
THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT WILL ASK
BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT THE MAINSPRING IS STILL WORKING
AS LONG AS THAT STILL GOES
IT'S GOT MORE VALUE
IT'S LIKE BEATING BITING ON A PIECE OF GLASS
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT
SOMETHING PERHAPS DOESN'T QUITE MARRY UP
IF YOU'RE BUYING A RESTORED PIECE FOR A RESTORED PRICE
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE DOING IS BUYING A RESTORED PIECE FOR A PERFECT PRICE
IF A POT HAS BEEN RESTORED AND YOU BITE INTO IT
THE RESTORATION WILL COME BACK AND IT WILL CHANGE IN TIME
WE'LL NEVER KNOW
GET BUYING AND HAVE SOME FUN WITH ANTIQUES AND
REVEAL WHAT A STRONG IMAGE THAT IS
I WAS ABLE TO GIVE THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PAINTING TO JUAN GARCIA
THE MOST FAMOUS FLAMENCO GUITARIST IN ALL OF SPAIN
NOW I LOOK MORE CLOSELY
NO DOUBT WE SHALL HEAR FROM THEM SOON IN SOME SECRET
I WOULD HOLD OUT UNTIL SOMEONE LIT A CIGARETTE
WHICH CONTAINS A SPECIAL GESTAPO TRUTH SERUM EXTRACTED FROM THE FEMALE PERUVIAN
A GLASS OF WINE FOR HELGA
AFTER I STOLE IT FROM YOU
THE ERO OF THE RESISTANCE
I AM HERE IN MY SECRET HEADQUARTERS PLANNING TO OVERTHROW THE GERMANS
I ALWAYS GO SLOWLY
OUT OF THEIR DYNASTIC AMBITIONS WOULD GROW AN ENGLISH EMPIRE
HE ACCEPTED ON BEHALF OF HIS YOUNGER SON
EXCOMMUNICATION WOULD BE UNBEARABLE
BUT STILL HE PURSUED THE POLICY
EVEN HIS OWN BROTHER THOUGHT HE'D GONE MAD
I SELL YOU THE MOON
NOW CLIMB UP AND TAKE IT
IT WAS AN AMBITIOUS PLAN TO EXPAND PLANTAGENET POWER
BUT IT PLACED ROYAL FAMILY INTERESTS AGAINST THOSE OF THE BARONS
KNOW FOR A FACT THAT YOU WILL EITHER RETURN THE CASTLES OR LOSE YOUR HEAD
THE KING WAS STARTLED
THIS GAVE US THE NAME OF A NEW INSTITUTION
THE PROVISIONS OF OXFORD MARK AN IMPORTANT MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND
AND OF THE LIMITATION OF ROYAL POWER
I FEAR THUNDER AND LIGHTNING BEYOND MEASURE
PARLIAMENT NOW HAD THE BEGINNINGS OF A SECOND HOUSE
REPUTEDLY HE ONCE FRIGHTENED AN UNFORTUNATE ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
THOUSAND JEWS DEPARTED FROM THE SHORES OF ENGLAND
BUT EDWARD THE FIRST WAS A MAN WHO NEVER GAVE UP WHAT HE SAW AS HIS RIGHTS
AND THESE INCLUDED
A SON NAMED EDWARD
LITTLE MARGARET DIED IN ORKNEY ON HER WAY TO SCOTLAND
A MAN DOES GOOD BUSINESS WHEN HE RIDS HIMSELF OF A TURD
THE BRIDGE HERE WAS JUST WIDE ENOUGH FOR THE ENGLISH FORCES TO CROSS TWO ABREAST
SET THE LIMITS TO PLANTAGENET AMBITIONS IN BRITAIN
AND THEY PROVOKED A DEEPENING OF SCOTTISH NATIONAL PRIDE
GAVESTON WAS BEING HONOURED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT NOBLE IN THE LAND
AND THEY HAD PLENTY OF ENEMIES WHO WOULD HAVE BROUGHT IT UP
THE EARLIEST REFERENCES COME AFTER EDWARD'S DOWNFALL
BUT DISPENSER MADE AN ENEMY YET MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE BARONS EDWARD'S QUEEN
ISABELLA CAME TO DESPISE DISPENSER
IN THE WORDS OF A CONTEMPORARY CHRONICLE
WEEPING AND BARELY ABLE TO STAND
WITHIN THIRTY YEARS
EVER SINCE KING JOHN HAD LOST THEIR OLD LANDS IN FRANCE OVER A CENTURY BEFORE
AN ARMY OF AROUND TEN
AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT HE WAS NOT
SEND NO MORE TO ME TODAY
ITS ORIGINS WERE IN A GREAT TOURNAMENT AT WINDSOR
TWO TEAMS OF TWELVE KNIGHTS TOOK PART
ONE HEADED BY THE KING
AND ONE BY THE PRINCE
THE PRINCE OF WALES AND TWENTY FOUR KNIGHTS
ONE SET OF STALLS IS DESIGNATED THE KING'S
NOW EDWARD THE THIRD HAD BROUGHT THE NOBLEMEN OF ENGLAND BEHIND HIM IN HIS CAMPAIGN TO WIN THE THRONE OF
HE HAD HARNESSED ENGLAND'S GROWING SENSE OF NATIONHOOD TO HIS OWN PLANTAGENET DYNASTIC VISION
ENGLISH WAS NO LONGER SPOKEN JUST BY THE PEASANTS WHO WORKED THE LAND
EVEN THE KING SPOKE IT
I HOPE YOU'RE STANDING BY FOR THIS AND LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
JUST THINK WHAT WE'VE LOOKED AT
I WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION WITH YOU
WE'VE TRAVELLED THE LENGTH AND THE BREADTH OF THE BRITISH ISLES
OUR HISTORY AND CULTURE HAS INFLUENCED NATIONS AND PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE GLOBE
OUR ANTIQUES ARE HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER WORLDWIDE
I WORK IN EAST ANGLIA AT THE MOMENT
NAMES LIKE WEDGEWOOD
THAT THAT MAKING REALLY DISTINCTIVE THINGS
NOT JUST IN SILVER OR POTTERY
WE SEE A LOT OF THEIR WORK ON THE SHOW AND IT OFTEN SELLS FOR A SMALL FORTUNE
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LESSER KNOWN DESIGNERS AND MAKERS WHOSE WORK DESERVES MORE ATTENTION
WHOSE WORK IS SOMEWHAT UNDER THE RADAR
SO IF IT DOESN'T SAY TURICK ON IT
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF MARVELLOUS THINGS COMING OUT OF BRITAIN
BUT ALL THAT TRADITIONAL SHE WAS AN INNOVATOR IN HER OWN RIGHT
THAT TEA SERVICE CERTAINLY WASN'T MEANT FOR YOUR AVERAGE BUILDER'S BREW
AND WHAT A TREAT
AS WITH OTHER SILVERSMITHS
BUT HIS WORK IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE VERY BEST OF BRITISH
STYLISTICALLY LOOKS GEORGIAN
THAT WONDERFUL TEAPOT SHAPE
BUT HAVE YOU HEARD OF A CHAP CALLED WILLIAM VILE
WHAT SPRINGS TO MIND
PROBABLY STAFFORDSHIRE AND THE POTTERIES
THE EPICENTRE OF THE INDUSTRY IN THIS COUNTRY FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS
I LIKE TO THINK
AND VERY WELCOMING
UM AND BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK WE'VE GOT A RICHER SOCIETY FOR IT
AND A RICHER SOCIETY
SO ANYTHING TO DO WITH GARDENING GARDENING ANTIQUES
AND THE THING THAT MAKES ONE HORSE DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER
BUT IF THEY DID A PINK HORSE
THE BEIT MARKET
WHEN WE FILM THIS PIECE
IT WAS THROUGH THE ROOF
I THOUGHT I COULD TELL THIS WAS BY MOLAND WHEN I SAW THE PICTURE
I WAS RATHER PRAYING IT WAS BY HIM
BUT THE GREAT THING WAS
WHEN YOU TURNED IT OVER THERE WAS THIS WONDERFUL WRITING ON THE BACK WHICH TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE
BUT IN NO WAY COULD THIS EVER BE CALLED PUB MEMORABILIA
IT'S A PAINTING BY A GREAT ARTIST DONE THROUGH FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
SO PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY BE SHOUTING AT THE TELLY
IT'S NOT AN ANTIQUE
IT MAY HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE SEVENTY S
EVERYTHING WOULD BE MADE TO A VERY HIGH STANDARD BUT
BECAUSE THEY WERE WEALTHY
WITH THE OLYMPICS
SHE WANTED A FORTY POUND RESERVE IT DIDN'T MATTER
OAKS INDIGENOUS TO OUR SHORES
SO YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY IT SELLS WELL
IT'S ITS PASSPORT
THINGS LIKE THAT SO
I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'S WORTH A GREAT DEAL MORE
AND AND I TRAIN DOWN AT A GYM IN STOKE ON TRENT
WITH ALL THE BIG BOYS
GIVE ME A GOOD BEATING
SPECIFICALLY CRICKET AND BOXING I QUITE ENJOY PLAYING OR FIGHTING
AND THIS IS ONE OF MY PIECES HERE IT'S AH IT'S A SIGNED BOXING GLOVE FROM ONE OF MY FAVOURITES FROM
HIS FAMILY WERE THE FIRST TO INTRODUCE AND MAKE STAINLESS STEEL ITEMS IN THE WORLD
I MEAN I THINK THAT'S AN ACCOLADE YOU KNOW THE WEDDING PRESENT OF THE SIXTY S
AND IT FINDS ITS WAY TO THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE GLOBE
BEHIND EVERY GOOD MAN
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM GERMANY
WE HAVE MET SO MANY NICE PEOPLE
SUCH A VARIETY OF PEOPLE
IT CATCHES YOUR EYE AND IT'S QUITE AMAZING HOW MANY COMMENTS YOU ACTUALLY GET WHEN YOU
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY'S SHOW
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND US
DELAYED SHOCK HAS AFFECTED MY WIFE'S VOICE AND SHE IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER SHE WILL BE ABLE TO SING IN THE CAFE FOR SEVERAL
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA
LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY
BREATHING THROUGH STRAWS
TELL HIM THAT WE ARE CONTACTING HIS GODFATHER
WHICH I WOULD LIKE YOU
CAN I TRUST NO ONE
WHEN THE BALLS BING
WELL BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD
ABLE DISGUISE MYSELF AS YOUR DRIVER
ZE BISHOP HAS AGREED THAT WE CAN DISPENSE WITH NE WITNESSES AND THAT YOUR NAMES CAN BE KEPT SECRET
ABOUT ADOPTION LATER ON IN THE SERIES BUT
RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT
THAT TAKE PART PLACE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
SO THE GESTATION PERIOD OF A SHEEP FROM MATING TO BIRTH IS FIVE MONTHS
SO THE RAMS GO IN WITH THE EWES FIVE MONTHS AGO
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
I WILL NEVER FORGET IT
IT BUT AS TO HUMBLE THE LAMB
HAVE TO PUT A DISCLAIMER
SO IT BECAME A PET LAMB DURING THE SERIES
I'D LOVE TO KEEP HER
WILL YOU LOOK AFTER UNTIL I GET MY OWN SHEEP
ACTUALLY THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION THAT CAME IN FROM JOSH WILLIAM IN NORTHERN IRELAND
DO PUT THEM ON A LEAD WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH FIELDS FULL OF SHEEP
YOU MAY REMEMBER BACK IN THE FIRST SERIES
BACK IN THE AUTUMN
THE TIME CAME FOR THE TEXEL RAM THAT HAMISH BOUGHT AT KELSO TO BE PUT TO THE TEST
OR I COULD BE A ROVER
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW
TO BE IN YOUR PATH
AND THEY CREATED THIS
FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME
WITH THE INTERNET
BUT AT LEAST WE'LL BE ABLE TO CALCULATE THE PROFITS OR LOSSES
IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY
GET THE KIDS OUTSIDE WITH THIS ONE
NOW THE DECISION'S MADE
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT
AND KNOCK THE PRIEST OUT
WE WILL BROADCAST THE NEWS OF OUR MARRIAGE TO THE WORLD
DO NOT REFUSE ME
WE ARE GOING TO PUT YOU ON THE RADIO
I JUST CANNOT ABIDE THOSE OBNOXIOUS COMMIES
AT THE LOST MINUTE
THEY CANNOT WALK FAR
WHEN WE SET UP HOME
SO ON TODAY'S TRADE SECRETS WE'RE LOOKING AT DECORATIVE ITEMS WHICH TO LEAVE ALONE AND WHICH ARE
WE SET ABOUT DECORATING IT
SOME PEOPLE LIKE VERY LITTLE
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD ON THE EYE
THAT'S QUITE NICE
I'LL HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT
BY THEIR VERY NATURE
SOME OF THEM ARE OF VERY HIGH QUALITY
AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN THEY TURN UP AT OUR VALUATION DAYS
SUSPENDED IN OIL AND THEN THEY'LL PAINT IT WITH THIS METALLIC PIGMENT
I CAN BE LIKE THAT SOMETIMES
THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS THE SPRUNG BED
CREATING A DRAFT
SO BEDS HAD TO BE EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE
THE FEARSOME WARRIORS OF ANCIENT BRITAIN TERRIFIED THE INVADING ROMANS BY PAINTING THEMSELVES BLUE
IN GEORGIAN BRITAIN
THESE LOVELY LITTLE BOXES WERE ENAMELLED ON COPPER
AND YOU CAN SEE ON THIS ONE
BUT THEY ARE VERY FRAGILE
THEY WOULD BE MADE OF VELVET
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE
WE'RE NORMALLY REFERRING TO THE DESIGN AND THE MANUFACTURE OF FUNCTIONAL OBJECTS
MOST OF WHAT WE SEE AT A FLOG IT
VALUATION DAY FALLS INTO THIS CATEGORY YOUR UNWANTED HOUSEHOLD ITEMS
IT'S ALWAYS THE QUALITY THAT SHINES OUT
I THINK IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE HAD A WATER
YEARS AND YEARS OF KNOWING
YOU CAN'T RUB IT OUT
WHEN I SAW THEIR QUITE SIMPLE SHAPE AND THE VIBRANT COLOURS
THEY COULDN'T REALLY BE SCRATCHED
AND THE COLOURS ON THEM
IT WERE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL
BEST IN THE WORLD
WONDERFUL DEEP RED
THANKS TO ITS CURRENT OWNERS
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE SHIPYARD
BUT I CAN APPRECIATE THAT THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL
YOU STEP OUT THERE AND THE DOGS WILL RUN TO YOU
ASK QUESTIONS LATER
HIS HORRIBLE FRIEND IS COMING
WE WILL OFFER TO TRADE THE TWO
THE WORLD HAD GONE CRAZY FOR PORCELAIN
LONDON WAS GETTING RICHER AND THE RICH HAD TO DO SOMETHING WITH THEIR MONEY
AND THEY BOUGHT STUFF
THEY STARTED COLLECTING
AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES
THE MORAL ISSUES
OF HOGARTH'S DAY LUXURY
BECAUSE THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY
HE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS
AND SO TO HAVE HOGARTH'S DOGS ON THE MANTELPIECE WAS REALLY QUITE SOMETHING
AND THEY MADE A REVERSE MOULD
THIS IS THE REVERSE
AND THE DOG IS WARY
HE ELOPED WITH HIS DAUGHTER JANE
AND THE PRINTS OF HIS PAINTINGS
WILLIAM HOGARTH TAKES A THEME WHICH OTHER ARTISTS BEFORE HIM HAD USED THE DOG
A DUTCH DYNASTY
PEOPLE CALL THIS HOGOTH'S SELF PORTRAITRA
AT THE SAME TIME
HE WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY TO SEND UP THE ALLEGED MYSTICISM OF THE GROUP HE
ARE YOU THE ONE WHO
AT THE BACK OF YOUR CUPBOARD OR IN THE ATTIC
MAY HAVE A TERRACOTTA MODEL
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BEAUTY
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GRACE
IT WAS ALMOST AS IF HIS FATHER FROM THE SCHOOLMASTER DAYS TOOK OVER HIS EGO
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH HE REALLY SEES IN HIMSELF
TRY TO UNDERSTAND
MY MUM TURNS EIGHTY THIS YEAR
WELL IT DIDN'T TAKE THE KING LONG TO SQUASH THAT PARTICULAR REBELLION
WHO WAS SHOT IN THE WAR
IS IT THAT TIME ALREADY
LET'S REMIND OURSELVES WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
MICHELLE MY BELLE
WHATEVER IS LEFT OVER
WATCH OVER MY DAUGHTER
SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE
YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE
THESE WERE INVENTED WHEN THE AGE OF THE GRAMOPHONE STARTED KICKING IN AND PEOPLE WERE RECORDING
MANY GREAT INVENTIONS TOOK PLACE DURING THIS PERIOD
THE DIVING BELL
MANY MORE AND LOTS OF FUN THINGS TOO
TEAM HAS THEIR OWN WAY OF SNIFFING OUT QUALITY ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES
BEING VERY BUSY
BUT THIS SHOW IS ALL ABOUT GETTING YOU IN THE KNOW SO WE'VE ASKED ADAM PARTRIDGE TO REVEAL THE
HAS HAD CHANGES MADE
A WATCH OPENER MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA
WHAT ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT A MAGNET FOR
IT'S ALSO USEFUL WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING THROUGH JOB LOTS OF JEWELLERY
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS
WHEN I SAW A PICTURE OF IT
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND US
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY'S SHOW
I HAVE A CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION
CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS
IT IS RIDICULOUS FOR A MAN OF MY AGE TO GO CHASING AFTER YOUNG GIRLS
HOLD YOUR FIRM YOUNG BODY AGAINST MY FIRM
I READ A LOT OF EDGAR ALLPO
I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY YOU MARRIED HER
DO NOT BE RIDICULOUS
I AM A RESPECTED MEMBER OF THIS COMMUNITY
BUT I AM NEVER ASKED TO HELP
I AM ALWAYS BRUSHED ASIDE
WHATEVER YOU SAY
I MUST GET BACK AND LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT I AM SAFE
MY RESISTANCE RECRUITS AIDE IN THE SPINNING DRYERS
I SHALL MENTION THAT IN MY DISPATCHES
YOU SAID WITH THE LAMB THAT WAS BORN LAST NIGHT
LAMBS DON'T ALWAYS PRESENT THEMSELVES IN THAT WAY
NOW HAMISH HAS A NIGHT LAMBER CALLED ALISTA WHO COMES IN AFTER THE SHOW TO KEEP AN EYE ON ALL
SHEEP FARMERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY GET MORE AND MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WEATHER
SO BACK IN FEBRUARY
AND THE MOTHER WAS EXPECTING TWINS
HOW DID WE KNOW THAT
BUT DID IT MEAN THAT HER SECOND LAMB WAS ALSO GOING TO BE PROBLEMATIC
AND CHECK ON THEM
ADAM IS IN THE NURSERY WITH HAMISH'S WIFE
TECHNOLOGY IS MAKING THIS SORT OF GENETIC CHOICE EVEN
YOU KNOW IF I DON'T EVER HAVE TO GET IN THE CAR AND DRIVE
UM HAMISH AND SUSIE DO HAVE A HERD OF SCOTTISH BLACKFACE THEY LIVE OUT ON THE
I DO ACTUALLY QUITE LIKE MY JOB
IF YOU WANT ME TO MAKE A BREW FOR YOU
SO I DON'T REALLY NEED
IF YOU WERE TO COME ON TO NICK IN ANY WAY
HE WOULD PROBABLY RUN A MILE
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD DO THAT
REME WERE LIVID ABOUT YOU PISSING ON THEIR PATCH
JUST BECAUSE WE'VE
WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT INSTEAD
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING YEAH
BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS
LET'S HAVE A QUICK SQUINT
HE WAS A GOOD MAN
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS TIME
THE BLUEBELLS HAVE AN ADVANTAGE
THEY HAVE ONE THING THE GARDENER KNOWS ABOUT AT THEIR ROOTS
PASSES SUGARS TO THE FUNGUS
IF YOU WERE TO UNRAVEL THE TREE'S ROOTS
WHEN INGESTED IN YOUR STOMACH
PRODUCES A CHEMICAL THAT'S FOUND IN ROCKET FUEL
THAT WAS A PIPYRELL
NOW WE CAN'T HEAR IT
IT'S SO HIGH PITCHED
THERE ARE PLANS AFOOT TO RESTORE AND ENLARGE OUR AREAS OF BROADLEAF WOODLAND
OF ALL OUR HABITATS
BUT AT LEAST NOW THAT WE KNOW SOME OF THE PLACES TO LOOK
THAT WEEKEND WALK IN THE WOODS SHOULD BE ALL THE MORE REWARD
AS A WELL KNOWN RESISTANCE HERO
IT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE THAT YOU MUST STAY HERE
MY REAL NAME IS BASIL DEVERE COURTNEY
I HAVE THE MISSING BOOBY
BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE PAINTING IS
I GIVE IT A LOT MORE ATTENTION THAN I USED TO
ANYTHING BY THEM WOULD BE INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE
WHY NOT THINK IN TERMS OF JO JENSEN JEWELRY
SIGNED TO THE BASE
GEOFFREY BAXTER OF WHITEFRIARS GLASS FAME
PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE PATTERN
WHICH IS RELATIVELY RARE
HE WANTED TO SELL THINGS WHICH WERE
THE THAT NAME IS JUST SO POPULAR
IF YOU WANT AN EXAMPLE
REALLY DULL LOOKING PICTURE FRAMES IN RECENTLY
THEIR ARTS AND CRAFTS
YOU DIDN'T JUST HAVE YOUR ROLLS ROYCE WITH YOUR SILVER LADY OR WHATEVER IT IS ON THE FRONT
YOU'D GET YOUR OWN MASCOT THAT YOU FANCIED FOR YOUR CAR
THE LIST IS A LONG ONE
UM SO THEY WEREN'T MADE FOR SPECIFIC CARS
ESPECIALLY THE EARLY LALIQUE
AND ESPECIALLY CAR MASCOTS
PARTRIDGE VALUES FALCON TOO LOW
WELL THAT TOOK US ALL COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE YEAH
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE IN COMMON WITH EACH OTHER THEY ARE ALL PIONEERS OF
WHERE IS THAT FROM
WHICH IS YOU GET QUITE A LOT
SO MIGHT BE DISCOVERING A CONTINENT
AND THEY WERE MADE VERY MUCH FOR THE ORDINARY PERSON
SO HE SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE MORE PROFITABLE TO ACTUALLY TURN TO PRODUCTION OF ART POTTERY RATHER
THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC
THE WONDERFUL FORMS AND COLOURS OF HIS DESIGNS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
PROLIFIC DECORATION EVERYWHERE
AND SHE SAID TO ME OFF CAMERA
YOU LOOK VERY YOUNG
YOU DID SAY BEFOREHAND BUT
SAY THE RIGHT THINGS
IS THAT YOUR FATHER
AND THEIR HISTORY
THE FAMILY HISTORY
AND ACTUALLY THEY ENDED UP SELLING REALLY WELL
THESE OBJECTS WOULD BE MAKING
PLUS A NOUGHT PROBABLY
DESPITE THEIR DAMAGE
UM AND IT'S UNUSUAL
YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS
TIME HASN'T BEEN VERY NICE TO ME
NOT SO MUCH IN PERSONALITY
IN THE WAY HE IS
BUT I HAVE KEPT MY HAIR
I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE A SCREEN TEST
AND OF COURSE MY BRAIN WAS SWIMMING AROUND
WHAT HAVE I SAID
WHAT VALUATIONS HAVE I PUT ON THESE THINGS
UM IT WAS QUITE CONCERNING
I HAD LONGER HAIR THAN THAT BEFORE
IN THE DOORWAY AT FOUR HUNDRED
MY BI IS ARE WELL OUT
IN FRONT OF THE CONTRIBUTORS
THE ADRENALINE KICKS IN
AND IT WAS JUST BRILLIANT
THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC
BECAUSE AS WELL AS THE BOOKS THAT WE HAVE IN THE LIBRARY
AND IF WE FIND ANYTHING ELSE IN SCHOOL WE CAN SELL
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY'S SHOW
BUY SOME ANTIQUES
THE CELEBRATED ASTRONOMER
PHOTOGRAPHED BY JULIA MARGARET CAMERON
YOU ARE PROBABLY WONDERING WHAT I AM DOING LYING ON A TABLE WITH MY TROUSERS
I PRESUME MASSAGING MY MANLY SHOULDERS IS DRIVING YOU VI WITH EXCITEMENT
I DO NOT BELIEVE IT
YOU LOST YOUR MEMORY
GET YOU OUT OF THOSE FILTHY CLOTHES
AND GIVE YOU A NICE HOT RELAXING
IT WAS QUITE A TRICKY BIRTH
AND THEN OF COURSE WAS TAKEN OUT TO THE FIELD
I SUPPOSE IF YOU PUT THE WEIGHT OF THEM BOTH TOGETHER
AND HAVING HER WORKING AT HOME ON THE FARM
IF AWAY FOR TOO LONG
THAT'S WHERE THEY WILL BE
BUT IN THIS CASE
SO BY OVERWHELMING POPULAR DEMAND
REALLY IS QUITE AN ART
SOME MIGHT USE AGENTS WHO COME IN AND HELP THEM OUT SO
ACTUALLY BE SAYING
LABOUR PRICES CAN GO UP
FARMING IS A BIT OF A ROLLER COASTER AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH THOSE THINGS
YOUR HUSBANDRY AND THE WAY YOU LOOK AFTER THEM HAS GOT TO BE SPOT ON
THE BEST WAY WE LOOK AFTER OUR STAFF
WE SAW EARLIER IN THE WEEK THAT THE HOGS THE YEAR OLD SHEEP THAT
I WENT OUT INTO THE FIELDS WITH HAMISH TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE RAMS
BUT WHEN YOU GOT THOUSANDS OF SHEEP
THE NEXT STAGE IS THEM GOING TO THE ABATTOIR AND I JOINED HAMISH AND SUSIE BACK IN SEPTEMBER TO
JUST HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF OUR HIGHLIGHTS
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT BEING ON THE FARM
THEY SHOULD FEEL FIRM
USING THE SAME CRITERIA
YOU MUST BE ABLE TO SEE THE TUBERS
YOU'VE GOT THE PREMIER DIVISION OF THE THE TOP GROWERS
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
LETTING OTHER PEOPLE WHETHER
EVEN MY OWN CHILDREN
REMOVING SOME OF THE DEAD MATERIAL
SPLITTING PLANTS AND ADDING SOME MORE PLANTS TO FILL THE SPACE WHERE THE HEDGES WERE
NOT JUST A DRY BORDER
TAKE OUT ALL THE WEEDS
ROCK GARDENS HAVE BEEN A POPULAR FEATURE
IT'S PART OF THE NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME
YOU WILL FIND ALL THE DETAILS
THE RAIN HAS BACKED OFF
YOU WANT TO DO SO AS AN ENTITY
WERE BACK TO OUR NORMAL TIME OF EIGHT
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ONLY TO PUT IN PLANTS THAT WILL RELISH BAKING
THAT'S IT FOR THIS WEEK
TO BE QUITE HONEST WITH YOU
I ONLY USED TO SING HIM LULLABIES
AND I CAN HAVE IT FINISHED BY TONIGHT
GARLIC AND WOODEN STAK
I MADE YOUR COSTUME FOR YOU
IT WAS HARVEST FESTIVAL
HE'S ALWAYS THERE
ALWAYS AN EXPERIENCE TO BE AROUND
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING
SHE WAS REACHING OUT
AND I'M HAVING ONE RIGHT NOW
AND WHY NOT GO BACK AND SEE HIM IF SHE WANTS TO
I'M NOT GOING TO SEE STACEY
NOBODY HAMMERING IN THE BACKGROUND
WITH THE ALBERT OPENING NEXT WEEK
WE JUST NEED A GRAND
LET'S HOPE OUR EXPERTS SCORE TOP MARKS WHEN IT COMES TO VALUING ANTIQUES BROUGHT IN BY THE PEOPLE OF OXFORD
I'D SAY TWO TO THREE HUNDRED
AND ONE OF THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FIRST EDITION WAS A MAN CALLED WILLIAM
AMONG MANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS
THEY HAVE TO GO AROUND LIBRARIES IN OXFORD
I GUESS AT THAT TIME
THAT'S DOCUMENTING SOCIAL HISTORY
IT WASN'T THE PICTURE YOU WANTED
I HAD A CHAT TO SIMON JUST BEFORE THE YEAH STARTED
YOU HAD A WORD WITH HIM
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS EXCITING
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
COLLECTORS ARE QUITE FUSSY BUT
SO IT MAKES UP THE PAIR
LOOK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS PEWTER CANDLESTICK
IT IS ARCHIE BOARD KNOX
BUT THE NICE THING IS
SO A COMPETITION WAS LAUNCHED AMONG LOCAL SCHOOLS ASKING PUPILS TO COME UP WITH NEW
START ON THE MOUTH
WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE REST OF THEM
IT'S GREAT TO MEET NICHOLAS
THESE THINGS ARE SO HARD TO PUT A PRICE ON
YOU'VE GOT A LOT MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED
ALL IN GOOD TIME
BUT I SAID I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS AN AWFULLY GOOD IDEA
AND IF IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO THEM I
THIS IS A VERY EXCITING BIT OF NEWS
I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY ARE HERE YET
I'VE NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU
THAT ME TWIN BROTHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
I'M A BIT WORRIED ABOUT MANNERING
RIGHT JUST LEAVE IT TO ME
FOR COOK AND HIS MEN
IT REPRESENTED NOTHING MORE THAN A DEADLY
THAT'S WHAT I'LL BE FINDING OUT
AS I'LL BE FINDING OUT LATER
I DIDN'T REALLY APPRECIATE THE DURHAM DEALS UNTIL I LEFT
UM THERE'S A LOT WE DO
NO OFFICIAL FIGURES EXIST FOR THE NUMBER OF STOLEN DOGS
BUT ONE NATIONAL ORGANISATION
SAID THEY HAD TWELVE
THOUSAND REPORTED TO THEM AS LOST LAST YEAR AND THEY RECKON
THE SHOOTING INDUSTRY HAS HAS GROWN REALLY SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES AND THERE'S A LOT OF
A LOT OF MONEY INVOLVED
AND I'M AFRAID THAT WHILST MOST OF US SEE A DOG AS A PET
THEY'VE ALSO BECOME A COMMODITY
BECOME REALLY VALUABLE
IF YOU'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THE FIELD
AH FOR THE JOB IN MIND BUT
AND THEY HAD A BIT OF A LOOK ROUND BUT
THEY TEND TO COME FROM PRICEY PEDIGREE STOCK AND
IN OUR EXPERIENCE
SOME PEOPLE WILL GO TO EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS TO GET THEIR DOG BACK
WE CHANGED THAT RULE
MY MOM RULES THE ROOST BUT
WE HAD A GROUP OF DOGS
THAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL
SO SOMETHING WE WOULD DISCUSS WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE
WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL OWNER AND WE WILL GIVE THEM ADVICE ACCORDING TO THEIR ACTUAL SITUATION
BECAUSE NO TWO DOG FS ARE THE SAME
IF WE START PROSECUTING THEM
THE MESSAGE WILL SOON GO OUT
HAVING SAID THAT
DOGS IN GENERAL
JUST LOOK AT THEM
WE'RE ALL HERE JUST FOR A VERY MINUSCULE AMOUNT OF TIME
THAT ANY ANY WILDLIFE AND FARMING'S TAUGHT ME
WE'RE GOING TO BE IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE ON MY SMALL HOLDING
FINDING OUT ABOUT HER VIEWS ON HORSES
FARMING AND THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRYSIDE
THE IDEA OF FIXED
WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THE ROMANS
NEAR MY COTTAGE IN CUMBRIA
THEY CALLED IT CIVILISATION
BY THE TIME THEY INVADED BRITAIN
IF YOU WERE ON THIS SIDE OF THE WALL
IT MEANS NASTY LITTLE BRITS
AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE OF HANDWRITEN ROMAN MILITARY DOCUMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN DUG OUT OF THE
YEAH AND THE OTHER SCENARIO IS WHERE THEY PICK PEOPLE UP AND SAY
WE NEED THAT LANDSCAPE
WE NEED THE LAND
BUT YOU CAN IF YOU WISH
SENDING OUT A VERY VIVID MESSAGE
PACKED HIGH IN GRANARIES LIKE THIS
TO KEEP IT DRY FROM THE FOUL BRITISH WEATHER
THE OFFICERS OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN A POST APOCALYPTIC WORLD
UP TO HIS NECK IN WATER
DURING THE NORTH AFRICAN WINTERS
BUT IT WASN'T A NATURAL BUILDING MATERIAL FOR THE BRITONS OR THE SAXONS
IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
HIGHER GRADE METAL WORK
WITHIN THAT SHORT GENERATION
WE HAVE LIKE A CIRCLE DANCING
I TALK TOO MUCH
SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY
YOU HAVE PUTTAN
WE'LL DISCOVER WHO THEY'LL BE PLAYING
I'M ZACK VERMEER FROM SYDNEY
AND I STUDY LAW
I'M FROM BLACKBURN IN LANCASHIRE AND I'M STUDYING POLITICS
I'M FROMLI
MY NAME'S MAVE WEBER
I'M JAMES FIGUEO FROM SURREY AND I'M READING AFRICAN STUDIES AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AND WE SAW TRINITY COLLEGE
WIN THE FIRST PLACE IN NEXT WEEK'S FINAL
SO I HOPE YOU CAN JOIN US NEXT TIME FOR THE LONG AWAITED FINAL
ANYTHING LESS THAN TWENTY
MY PRACTICING OF BUDDHISM
WHAT HAVE YOU ACTUALLY SPENT
AND IT'S ABOUT WATCHING THE MARGIN
POINT SEVEN PLUS OR MINUS NOT
SO TO SAY THAT SHE'S HAD A DRESS DESIGNED KNOW BY ME FOR HER HER WEDDING DAY
I KNOW NICE FOOD
ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LOVED IT
I'VE BEEN DABBLING IN THIS BUSINESS FOR FORTY YEARS
YOU KNOW HALFWAY BETWEEN FORTY AND SEVENTY FIVE
I'M IN THE BASEMENT ALREADY
I'M THE YOUNG PRETENDER
I WENT IN THERE WITH THIS GREAT GAMBLE OF MY STALLS MY CINEMA CHAIRS
HE'S AHEAD ON THE FIRST TWENTY YARDS
I WAS A GAMBLER
AND OF COURSE THEY ARE COMPARATIVELY EXPENSIVE
IF I CAN'T EVEN WORK OUT HOW MUCH I'VE PAID FOR IT
EVERY SINGLE ROOM
NOT THE DONKEY WORK
HE WASN'T THERE
THIS TAKES OVER THEM
THIS IS THEIR BEDROOM
MY BEDROOM WAS MY LAYER
THERE ARE HARDLY ANY OF US THAT HAVEN'T SEEN A STAR WARS FILM
IT'S NOT JUST THE MOVIES THAT MADE BIG BUCKS
WHEN WE GET THE HOUSE IN ORDER
AND IT HAS TO BE AWARE
TWELVE THE STAR WARS FILMS HAVE GENERATED AN ESTIMATED FOUR
POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN TICKET SALES
EVERYONE UNDER ESTIMATES THE VAN IN MOVEMENT
I JUST WANT SOME AREAS THAT I CAN CALL MY OWN REALLY
IT'S PART OF ME AND
IF I HAD A FAMILY
AH THIS LOOKS LIKE A CONVENTIONAL BUILDING INSIDE SO
AND ONE WONDERS
GIVEN THAT HE'S A KIND OF YOUNG
TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD GUY
WHY HE CAN'T DO SOMETHING A BIT MORE DYNAMIC WITH YOU KNOW SOME OTHER
MAKE HIM MORE AMBITIOUS
IN THIS COUNTRY
THAT'S WHY WE LAG BEHIND THE REST OF THE WORLD IN DOING UNUSUAL
ORIGINALLY I WAS LOOKING AT RENDERING THIS WALL
I DO QUITE LIKE IT
THE MORE I LOOK AT IT
THIS FEELS LIKE A SPECIAL
INTERESTING PIECE OF ARCHITECTURE AND I HAD TO KEEP PINCHING MYSELF AND REMINDING THAT THIS ONLY
HE HAS A HOUSE THAT HE REALLY BELIEVES IN
AND THEY GET BACK TO NORMAL LIFE
HE'S COME FROM A CONVENTIONAL HOUSE BUILDING BACKGROUND
WHY WOULD YOU EXPLORE THE LAGOON
IT'S RELATIVELY HOSTILE
THAT'S A BLINK OF AN EYE IN GEOLOGICAL TIME
AND IT MADE A REAL IMPRESSION ON CAPTAIN COOK WHEN HE CAME HERE IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY
THEY'RE THE MANGROVES
CIDER WITH ROSIE
THIS HAS GOT TO PAY ITS WAY
BUT THE MEAT TRADE HAS A WAY
IT ADDS VALUE TO THE ANIMAL
AS I'LL BE DISCOVERING LATER
THE PRINCESS HAS PRETTY STRONG VIEWS ABOUT WHO THE CULPRIT IS AND WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT IT
WHAT'S HER NAME
YOU ARE LIKELY TO GET MORE
BUT IT'S A GOOD QUESTION
HOW DO WE GO ABOUT BRINGING THEM BACK
IN THE MEANTIME
O PACKETS OF THESE SEEDS TO GIVE AWAY
BEFORE I PUT MINE IN THE GROUND
I WANT TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT'S IN HERE
CIDER WITH ROSIE
SO WE'RE PUTTING ONE OF THE POSTS WITH THE POEM
AND WILD TREES IS GOING IN LAURIE LEE WOOD
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT ON WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LAURIE LEE'S ONE HUNDREDTH BIRTHDAY
WHEN HE WROTE IT
I DON'T THINK FOR ONE MINUTE HE EVER EXPECTED THAT
AND WE WERE ABLE
NOT ONLY TO BUY THE WOOD
WHAT WAS INTERESTING
WE HAD SOME DONATIONS FROM AMERICA
WHERE LAURIE HAS SO MANY KIND OF OF HIS OLD HORNS
IT WOULD BE MY FAVOURITE
LIKE MANY FARMERS
THEY'VE GOT SOME VALUE
YOU'D HAVE TO SAY THAT TOO MANY BADGES
THE PERSON WHO WAS DEDICATED TO CHEESEMAKING
THEY RUN TO FAT TOO QUICKLY
TALK QUIETLY TO THEM
THAT WAS DEEMED TO BE HOVEN
WHEN THEY USED TO SELL CHEESE
FOR THE SAME REASON
EVEN IF YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE THE SOUND OF IT YOURSELF
AND ALSO TACKLE SOME OF THE BIG ISSUES FACING BRITISH FARMING TODAY
WOULD YOU PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH
FROM PRIVILEGE AND BIRTHRIGHT
HER OPINIONS ARE VERY DIVISIVE AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT SOME WELL INFORMED PEOPLE WOULD
I'LL BE FINDING OUT WHERE TO START
KEEP THE GRASS DOWN A BIT
SO YOU'LL GET THE GROUND FEEDING
I'M IN SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN SQUARE MILES OF PRIME COUNTRYSIDE THAT HAS JUST
EARLIER THIS YEAR
JUST NOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE STATION OR THEY WERE TOO FAR OUT IN THE STICKS
WE DO HAVE SOME GREAT PROPERTIES LINED UP
BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
LET'S HOPE THE ONES WE'VE LINED UP FOR THIS WEEK'S COUPLE FIT THEIR BILL
BUT I FEEL THAT
A BIT OF SAILING
SO WITH THAT IN MIND
WE COULD PROBABLY STRETCH TO FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND
ONE OF THE BIGGEST DECISIONS ANYONE CAN MAKE AND FEW OF US EXPECT TO FIND THE PERFECT PROPERTY
BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION
GEORGIE CERTAINLY HAD HER RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE COTTAGE
BUT WILL SEEM VERY TAKEN WITH IT
THEY WERE BOTH SO SURPRISED
AND I THINK IT REALLY HAS PUT THINGS IN A SPIN IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY
HE HAD A LARGE NUMBER AND HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY RICH MAN THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF THE MIDDLE
EVEN IN THIS DAMP WEATHER
WILL CERTAINLY KNOWS THIS AREA
AND VERY CLOSE TO HIS HEART BY THE SOUNDS OF IT BUT
I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT THE PROPERTY
BUT AT THAT PRICE
AND HE GAVE THE PULPIT
THIS COUPLE ARE CASH BUYERS
SO ARE IN A POSITION OF STRENGTH IN THE CURRENT MARKET
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
LOOKING AT THE COTTAGE
IT'S TIME FOR THE MYSTERY HOUSE AND I KNOW THAT WILL AND GEORGIE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE ON A BIT OF A
LET'S SEE HOW FAR WE CAN STRETCH THEIR IMAGINATION
I WOULDN'T DISAGREE THERE
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A KNOW ON THIS ONE
I WAS REALLY CONCERNED THAT WILL AND GEORGE'S EXPECTATIONS WERE JUST TOO HIGH
THAT'S ALL I COULD MANAGE IN HALF AN HOUR
POETS AND ARTISTS HAVE ALL TRAVELLED THROUGH PERTHSHIRE
LEAVING BEHIND THEM A RICH LEGACY OF CASTLES
A MOVE TO THE COUNTRY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CHILDHOOD DREAM FOR IAN AND LISA
WITH THE SALE OF THEIR HOUSE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY COULD BE A STEP CLOSER TO FULFILLING IT
SO LET'S JUST HOPE THEIR BUDGET OF THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
THERE'S A LACK OF SUPPLY
WHICH MEANT DEMAND HAS STAYED PRETTY STRONG FOR THIS PART OF THE WORLD
SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO DO A BIT OF WORK TO MAKE IT PERFECT
LET'S GO TO THE FIRST PROPERTY AND WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE A BIT A LEARNING CURVE
ONCE YOU HAVE A MORTGAGE IN PLACE OR CASH IN THE BANK
WHICH MAKES IT TIME NOW TO GIVE A BIG HIGHLAND FLING TO TODAY'S BORDER HOPPING BUYERS
IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE YOUR OFFER ACCEPTED
I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO FAR AWAY FROM THAT
THERE'S NONWRITTEN RULE THAT NEITHER THE BUYER NOR THE VENDOR PULLS OUT OF THE DEAL
IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE FEEL
WHICH MEANS THOSE TWO DREADED HOUSE BUYING WORDS OF CHAIN AND GAZUMP ARE VIRTUALLY UNHEARD OF HERE
SO WITH THAT IN MIND
THAT WE CAN LEAVE AT THE END OF THE NIGHT
HOPEFULLY I COULD CONVERT THOSE INTO A STUDIO AND SET UP MY OWN BUSINESS
I DON'T HAVE THAT FEEL
AT THE SAME PRICE
THE OWNERS KNOW WHAT THEY WANT
MAYBE SOMEWHERE APPROACHING THAT
IT TICKS EVERY BOX
AND BUT IT'S NOT IMMEDIATE
ALBEIT A TAD GLOOMY
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR OFFERS OVER THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE
IT HAS THE BUSINESS SIDE OF IT
GO BACK INSIDE IF YOU LIKE
SO AFTER ALL WE'VE SEEN AND DONE
BUT WE ALSO HAVE A VERY CLOSE RESERVE
I WISH YOU BOTH THE VERY VERY BEST OF LUCK AND WHATEVER HAPPENS
THE COMPLETION OF THEIR CURRENT HOME GOES THROUGH AS PLANNED
SO THEY CAN COME BACK HERE AND HAVE THE CHOICE OF AT LEAST ONE OF THE TWO PROPERTIES THEY REALLY FELL IN
THEY MAY EVEN BE SPOILT FOR CHOICE
SEE YOU NEXT TIME
PROVIDING OVER THREE
THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BECOME QUITE SO POPULAR
AH JUST SO THAT WE'RE NOT TOO REMOTE
BUT IN THE NEXT HOUSE
NOW I REALLY THINK THE KEY TO THIS SEARCH IS FINDING A GOOD LOCATION
IT'S IT'S A LOVELY AREA
YOU ALSO WANT TO HAVE A LET BUSINESS
A MAJOR REDEVELOPMENT IS PLANNED IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN IN HEREFORD
BRINGING IN NEW BUSINESS AND FRESH INVESTMENT
WHATEVER YOUR BUDGET
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PROPERTIES TO CHOOSE FROM
SO LET'S MEET TODAY'S PROPERTY SHOPPERS WHO ARE HOPING TO WHILE AWAY THE HOURS ON THE WHY
SO FROM NINETEEN FORTY TWO ONWARDS
THE ENTIRE UK HARVEST WAS MADE INTO SQUASH FOR SCHOOLCHILDREN TO HAVE FREE OF CHARGE
AS WELL AS THE LODGE
WHICH ALL GOES TO MAKE A VERY CORDIAL WELCOME TO THIS COUNTY
LOVED THE LOCATION
SO LET'S GO OUTSIDE
THAT'S MY PREFERENCE
THEY BOTH GOT VERY EMOTIONAL
THEY'RE ALL DESPERATE FOR ACCOMMODATION HERE IN HEREFORD SHIP
THE MYSTERY HOUSE WELL
NOW IT'S NOT OFTEN I SAY THIS
I GOING TO WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK
I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE CRACKED IT
THEY BOTH FELL IN LOVE WITH IT
WE WISH THEM ALL THE VERY VERY BEST
BUT THERE WE ARE
WHILST BUILDING THE BUSINESS
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN LOTS OF YEARS AGO NOW
PHIL CAME TO LIVE WITH ME
THEN WE BOUGHT THE SIXTY INCH PLASMA
WHY ARE YOU IN THE JOB
I'M A HAPPY BOY ANYWAY
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE SENSITIVE ABOUT IT
I NEED THIS JOB
PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT THINGS
ONE ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER
HE DOESN'T LIKE PEOPLE YAWNING
I CAN LISTEN TO IT AND I'LL ABSORB SOME OF IT IN
THIS IS FATHER SON
EVERYONE IN THIS COMPANY IS DRIVEN BY SALES
WHETHER HE'S A REALLY NICE GUY OR NOT
EVEN THOUGH IT'S ON THE PHONE
STRUGGLING WITH THAT
MARY AND JANE PARMENTER
DEVON GETS SEVEN HALF HOURS OF SUNSHINE EVERY SUMMER'S DAY
BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO TEMPT TODAY'S BUYERS
BUT THAT FIGURE MIGHT BE THE REASON WHY PROPERTY PRICES HERE ARE EIGHTEEN PERCENT ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE
WITH THE NEIGHBOURS
APART FROM THREE BEDROOMS
I LIKE A BIT OF
IT'S CLEAN AND TIDY
WHICH YOU CAN SEE THERE
AS THEY CALL IT
THEY RAMPAGED THROUGH THE TOWN
IT'S MORE OF THE SAME
PROBABLY BE QUIET AS WELL
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY
OVERLOOKING THE WATER
I'VE I'VE ENJOYED IT
IT'S BEEN GREAT FUN
THEY DO WANT SOMETHING THEY CAN MOVE STRAIGHT INTO AND QUITE LIKE A BALCONY
THIS WAS A BARREN LANDSCAPE NO LEVEL GROUND
THOUSAND SPECIES FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
SINCE OPENING BACK IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND ONE
ELEVEN MILLION VISITORS HAVE COME THROUGH THE GATES
THE PRICE OF SEASIDE PROPERTY IN COASTAL HOTSPOTS SUCH AS PAO HAS RISEN BY AN INCREDIBLE
IT INCLUDING THE MYSTERY PROPERTY
WITH PLENTY OF CORNISH DELIGHTS ON OFFER
BUT LET'S HOPE THERE IS SOMETHING TO WHET THE APPETITE OF TODAY'S BUYERS
LET'S MEET THEM
SO ACTUALLY THERE IS A POSSIBILITY TO HAVE TWO BEDROOMS
TO HAVE THREE BEDROOMS
TO HAVE TWO BEDROOMS
A DETACHED PROPERTY WILL SET YOU BACK ABOUT EIGHT
HALF PERCENT ABOVE NATIONAL AVERAGE
THERE ARE SOME LOVELY PROPERTIES OUT THERE
SO TO GET BACK VIRTUALLY WHAT I PAID FOR IT
JUST PERFECT FOR YOU
THE CATS AND DOGS
SARAH STAMPS HER AUTHORITY NO MIKE
WE CAN'T AFFORD IT
OR WILL SARAH REALISE THAT BY SPENDING A LITTLE BIT OVER BUDGET
SHE GETS THE HOUSE OF HER DREAMS
IT COULD BE A SMALL PRICE TO PAY
CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW THEM THE MYSTERY PROPERTY
THEN I'D THINK ABOUT IT
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
IT'S AN AMAZINGLY IDYLLIC SPOT AND IN SO MANY RESPECTS
AND HE'S A BEAUTIFUL DOG
ALL WE NEED NOW IS FOR MIKE TO DECIDE TO EMBRACE THAT FARMER WITHIN HIM
IT'S EVERYTHING THAT WE WOULD EVER
VERSUS THE HEAD
THEY'RE VERY DEFINITE ABOUT WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE
THAT'S WHEN IT GETS A BIT CONFUSING
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE AND THEIR SELFLESSNESS WITH REGARD TO THEIR CATS AND DOGS IS ADMIRABLE
IT'S BEEN QUITE TRICKY FINDING A HOUSE THAT'LL KEEP THEM ALL HAPPY
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY IN MOST SENSES
TO HAVE HIS GRANDDAUGHTER HERE
WHEN THEY BECOME ADULT
THEY TURN SILVER
SO ALL MALES BECOME SILVERBACK
IT CAN BE EXHAUSTION
AND THIS IS THE FINAL EVENING
BUT THAT IS WHAT TONIGHT IS ALL ABOUT ADMITTING IT
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CONOR OH
TWICE NOMINATED FOR A MERCURY MUSIC PRIZE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
SO UPLIFTING AND SO HOPEFUL
OF THIS GREAT EVENING
BY ANY STANDARD
WE'RE VERY SORRY
AND THEY DON'T FEED ON CHIPS
AND A WOOD PIGEON IS A DELICIOUS THING TO EAT
IS NOT EVERYONE'S CUP OF TEA
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE CELEBRATION OF THE EGG
I QUITE LIKE THAT
AND AS THEY PACKED UP
QUICK AND STRESS FREE
THE OLD FASHIONED
I'M SURE THEY HAVEN'T
PEOPLE STICK WITH WHAT THEY KNOW
COMPULSORY PURCHASE THING
STUFF IT WITH STUFF
AND THE THING IS
UNDERNEATH ALL THAT
AND HAVING SAID THAT
AND IT WAS A BIT OF LUCK WHERE ONE OF THE MAJOR SUPERMARKET SUPPLIERS ASKED IF I COULD GET SOME
WHEN WE'VE BEEN OUT COMBING A BEACH
IT'S OUR SARDINES ON TOAST
WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT
EVERYONE'S A BABY
IT'S NOT SO MANY EYES
NOT SO MANY ES
HE CAN SIT THERE
AND SWEET AND TASTY WITH A NICE GOLDEN
SHALL WE SCRAMBLE
THAT GAVE MONTAGU AND CHALEY JUST THREE MONTHS TO FIND A DEAD BODY
MUCH THE SAME AS IT WOULD BE NOW
THE LETTERS WERE ACTUALLY WRITTEN BY HESTER LEGGETT
ELDERLY AND UNMARRIED
BECAUSE IF IT DOES
ON IT SHE WROTE
AS ONE ALWAYS DID
MONTAGU AND CHOUMLEY BEGAN TO FEAR THAT THE BRIEFCASE
GOEBBELS WONDERED WHETHER THE LETTER WAS AN ELABORATE AND VERY BRITISH HOAX
THAT WAS ALL THAT MATTERED
NOT TO SAY BARBARIC IDEA
WHAT GOES WITHDO
LIFE DEPENDED ON THE POTATO
BOTTOM GETS HOT
A LARGE PART OF THE RELIGION LOST
COMBINE THOSE TWO
IF YOU CUT THEM UP AND BOIL THEM
OUR PET COBBLER
AND I TELL YOU SOMETHING
YOUR BAROMETER OF COMFORT FOOD IS GOING TO NEED TO BE RESET
SO WHAT WE DO NOW IS
WHEN IT STARTS TO BUBBLE AWAY
WE PUT IT INTO A PREHEATED OVEN
ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES CELSIUS FOR A FANOVN FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES
IT WOULD JUST LOOK HEAVIER
BUT IN ACTUAL FACT
THIS LOOKS LIKE A SPONGE CAKE
BUT A CHOCOLATE
SO THE STORY GOES
VERY WAFER THIN
IS HOW CRISPS WERE BORN
SO THAT POSSIBLY ISN'T POLITICALLY CORRECT
WE'RE GOING TO WEIGH ONCE A WEEK AS A CLUB OF PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST GOING TO MOTIVATE EACH OTHER
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND
AND THAT'S MY STORY
RIGHT NOW YOUR AS IS HANGING OUT OF A WINDOW
I DO LIKE GEORGE
PROBABLY TASTES WORSE
THAT'S WHY I THINK WHEN PEOPLE JOIN CLUBS THEY DO SO WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE COMPETING AGAINST SOMEONE
TALKING ABOUT THIS
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T REALLY OPERATE LIKE THAT
WHAT HE CALLED
AND TODAY WE HAVE A HUGE VARIETY OF MARKETS TO BUY OUR FOOD FROM
THEY HAVE A WORD FOR WALNUTS WHICH
MARGARET THATCHER WAS IN POWER
THE RESPONSE THAT I GOT ON THE DOORSTEP THAT FIRST WEEK
YOU KNOW WE COMMUNICATE WITH THEM THROUGH THE WEBSITE
THAT DOES NOTHING ABOUT MY DEMEANOUR IN THE WINTER
ESPECIALLY AROUND FOOD
AS A MARKET STALL
AND FISH MARKET
IT'S QUICK TO PUT TOGETHER AND WE'RE GOING TO DO A PANANG FISH CURRY
AND ALL THE TEXTURAL DIFFERENCES
I'LL BE INVESTIGATING
AND TO GET GOATS MILKING
THEY HAVE TO GIVE BIRTH TO KIDS
FINDING A HOME FOR THE BILLY KIDS
HAS BEEN A BIT OF A PROBLEM
BUT AS TOM HAS BEEN FINDING OUT
IT'S ALL TOO EASY TO FORGET THE POTENTIAL DANGERS OF WORKING IN THE BUSINESS OF AGRICULTURE
AND SOMETIMES THAT CAN MEAN THAT THEY TRY TO GET THE JOB DONE AT ANY
IN THE LAST DECADE
THE NUMBER OF FATALITIES IN FARMING HAS REMAINED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
SO USING CHEMICALS AS WELL
ALMOST THREE QUARTERS OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION EAT GOAT MEAT
AH CHINA AND INDIA
THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS NEEDS TO COME DOWN
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS
HEALTH AND SAFETY PROFILE HAS RAISED BEEN RAISED A LOT WITH OUR MEMBERS
WE'RE GIVING A LOT MORE GUIDANCE OUT TO MEMBERS
I WENT STRAIGHT IN TO CHECK THE MACHINE WAS RUNNING THE RIGHT DIRECTION
YEAH I WORK IN A DANGEROUS INDUSTRY
SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED EVERY DAY
DURING THE SUMMER WHEN YOU'RE BUSY
THE AVERAGE FARMER IS IN THEIR MID FIFTY S AND THEIR ATTITUDE TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CAN BE VERY
AND ALL WE'RE DOING
BELIEF IT DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM
FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW
THE NUMBER OF FACILITIESITIES ON FARMS HAS REMAINED STUBBORNLY HIGH FOR THE LAST DECADE
NOT ONE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF
LET'S FIND OUT WITH THE COUNTRYFILE FORECAST FOR THE WEEK
CELEBRATING WHAT HAS BEEN VOTED AS SEVENTY FIVE ICONS OF YORKSHIRE
AND BRITAIN HAD JUST TWO TELEVISION CHANNELS
A VERY WARM WELCOME TO YOU TO A VERY NEW SHOW
AND IT WAS WONDERFUL
TODAY AT WIMBLEDON
THAT'S WHERE I STARTED MY BBC CAREER BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE
AND THE PROGRAMME IS STILL GOING STRONG TODAY
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY HIGHLIGHTS
BUT THEN WHO COULD FORGET THE LONGEST MATCH
THAT WENT ON FOR THREE EXHAUSTING DAYS
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE YOU HAD LANDED FROM A PARALLEL UNIVERSE
NEVER FORGET IT AS LONG AS I LIVE BECAUSE HE'S BEEN MY BEST FRIEND IN SNOOKER
YOU'RE RIGHT IN THERE
IT WAS A GAME THAT WAS MADE FOR TELEVISION
SKI SUNDAY WAS BORN AND QUICKLY BECAME A FIRM FAMILY FAVOURITE
IT WAS A DIFFERENT WORLD
SO WHEN I STARTED WORK ON SKI SUNDAY MANY YEARS LATER
WE STILL REMEMBER THAT
BECAUSE HE'S A MAN
IT'S HARD TO BEAT THE GAME OF DARTS
IT FIRST APPEARED ON BBC TWO IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SPAT IN FRONT OF A BBC CAMERA
ONE MOMENT OF ANALYSIS
ONE MOMENT OF GENIUS AND ONE OF THE GREATEST TRIES EVER FROM THE BARBARIANS AGAINST THE
IT KEPT A RECORD BREAKING EIGHTEEN
BUT OVER THE PAST FIVE DECADES
THIS CHANNEL HAS CONTINUOUSLY BROUGHT AUDIENCES THE VERY BEST IN SPORTING ACTION
I'M AFRAID I CANNOT DO THAT
IT ISN'T A TIME FOR MOVING MONEY FROM ONE PART OF THE BUDGET TO ANOTHER YOU KNOW
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING AT HOME
SO WHEN WE HAVE FINISHED RENEGOTIATING BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION
LABOUR AND THE LIB DEMS OPPOSE OUR PLAN
THEY WON'T STAND UP FOR BRITAIN
AND THEY REFUSE TO GIVE YOU A SAY
CAUSE THE TROUBLE
START THE TROUBLE
AND THEN THE NEXT THING
THEY HADN'T DOUBLE SOLD THE SEATS
MY MUM WOULD SAY
I AM SEEING SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY WORKS IN THIS CALL CENTRE
BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS WORKED
WILL SORT THEM OUT
DON'T GO AND BUY A GUN AND SHOOT SOMEONE IN THE HEAD
TWENTY MINUTES LATE
A TEAM THAT BINDS TOGETHER
JUST BECAUSE KIERAN GIVES OUT A COUPLE OF JOBS TO SOMEBODY ELSE TO HELP THEM
SHE'S UPSET BUT SHE'LL BE FINE
I MEAN LOOKING AT EVERYTHING HERE
BOTANY IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF ATTEMPTS TO RESCUE A RISING WORLD POPULATION FROM STARVATION
AND THEN YOU FIND VARIETIES ON A THEME
HE IS TENACIOUS
SO IN THREE OF THE CHICKS YOU GET BLACK FEATHERS
YOU HAVE YOUR THREE TO ONE
ONE WHITE RATIO
BUT WHAT ABOUT OTHER PLANTS
IT SEEMS TO DEFY EVERYTHING BATESON HAS LEARNED ABOUT GENETICS
IT IS THE RESULT OF GENES WORKING TOGETHER LIKE THE COMPONENTS OF A BEAUTIFUL MACHINE
ASSEMBLING THEM USING THE BEST COMPONENTS
ARMED WITH THE NEW UNDERSTANDING OF GENETICS
HE WAS OFTEN HEARD TO SAY
IS BOURGEOIS WESTERN PROPAGANDA
STALIN IS LOOKING FOR A SCAPEGOAT
AND COMPARED TO THE OTHER WHEAT GROWING AROUND THE WORLD AT THE TIME OF ITS DISCOVERY
BECAUSE SHE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE A SINGLE ONE
AH ONE IN A BILLION CHANCE MUTATION
AND THAT MUST HAVE BEEN HEARTBREAKING BECAUSE EACH ONE OF MCCLINTOCK'S MAIZE PLANTS IS A UNIQUE
WE HAVE BEEN CREATING NEW PLANTS BY PUTTING POLLEN WHERE POLLEN SHOULD NEVER GO
THEY USE IT DIRECTLY FOR FOOD
THE NEXT REVOLUTION
BUT YOU'D BE WRONG
I SUPPOSE TO MOST PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO GO FURTHER
THEY WILL ENVELOP THE ROOT LIKE A KIND OF GLOVE
PLANTS COULDN'T THRIVE
SOME WOULD SAY SINISTER
AND IF IT HAS ITS WAY
THE BLACK LEAVES
AND THAT'S WHAT ALLOWS THIS DISEASE TO SPREAD SO FAR AND SO FAST
MYCELIUM SEEMS TO GROW
AT THE END OF ITS THE USEFUL LIFE
YOUR PACKAGING BECOMES A NUTRIENT FOR YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD
AND WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
THAT BREAKS DOWN THE CELLULOSE AND OTHER COMPOUNDS
WERE IT NOT FOR THE RELENTLESS ACTIVITY OF MYCELIUM
BUT THEY HAVE A SHORTAGE OF ONE ESSENTIAL ELEMENT
APPARENTLY ST FOR A FIELD MUSHROOM
I CAN'T THINK HOW
IT'S A CURIOUS FUNGUS WITH A STRANGE
THE CHEMICALS CONCEALED INSIDE THE CORDYCEPS MAY YET PROVE CRUCIAL TO A MAJOR
BUT FOR SOME REASON
TO FIND OUT THE ANSWER
WE HAVE TO DELVE DEEP INTO OUR OWN EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY
AND THIS IS THE TARN VALLEY
AND IT WAS DESIGNED BY THE BRITISH ARCHITECT SIR NORMAN FOSTER
WHICH IS PERHAPS MISSION IMPOSSIBLE
ALTHOUGH THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT ALSO THINKS THEY LOVE THE FREEDOM TO ROAM WITH HETTY THE MOTOR
WHATEVER THEY DECIDE
I WISH THEM ALL THE BEST
IF YOU EVER WONDER WHY ANYONE WOULD PUT THEMSELVES THROUGH THIS ORDEAL
THIS IS THE ANSWER TONIGHT'S GRAND FINAL
IT'S KNOWLEDGE AND NERVE
PROBABLY OF ALL TIME
HE WROTE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE STAGE
WHY DON'T YOU GO ON MASTERMIND
I THINK I MAY HAVE WON A RAFFLE WHEN I WAS ABOUT EIGHT
BUT APART FROM THAT
THE EXACT SPOT WHERE WHERE MODERN CINEMA BEGAN
SHE WAS ACTUALLY IN HER MID SEVENTY S DURING THE TRIALS AND
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT ALL THE SCORES
BUT THE SEARCH WILL START AGAIN LATER THIS YEAR TO FIND THE NEXT ONE
IT COULD BE YOU
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A MAN
AND IN SPITE OF APPEARANCES TO THE CONTRARY
IT IS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED
THANKS FOR WATCHING
FROM PEOPLE TO PLACES
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO COVER IT ALL IN ONE PROGRAMME
WHAT A GREAT POEM OF DEATH AND REGENERATION
THAT'S A MYTH ABOUT YORKSHIRE PEOPLE
THERE'S A MYTH ABOUT YORKSHIRE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE TIGHT AND STINGY
THE KIND OF CALL I GOT WAS
THERE IS SOME POINT IN KEEPING IT HEALTHY
IT'S ALL ABOUT RESPONSIBLE OWNERSHIP
WELL THE OPTIONS ARE
IT PUT TO SLEEP BY A VET
BUT BOTH OF THOSE OPTIONS WILL COST YOU
BUT WHAT WE ARE FINDING PEOPLE ARE AVOIDING DOING THAT BY SELLING THE PROBLEM ON
SELLING IT TO A MARKET
SELLING IT TO SOMEONE ELSE
TO BE HUMANELY SLAUGHTERED AND GO INTO THE HUMAN FOOD CHAIN
THAT IS THE OPTION THAT WE PASSIONATELY BELIEVE IS RIGHT FOR EQUINE WELFARE
THERE IS A LONG BOND BETWEEN HUMANS AND HORSES
PASSED ON THE RACECOURSE TODAY
WE PREPARE THE CARCASS HERE IN THE UK AND IT'S EXPORTED IN CARCASS FORM TO FRANCE
WE THINK OF YOUNG MEAT AS BEING GOOD SO
WOULD WE WANT TO EAT AN OLD NAG
THE QUALITY THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS VERY MUCH FROM AN OLDER HORSE
IT CAN NEVER BE EATEN
THAT THEY WON'T BE TREATED WHEN THEY NEED TO BE TREATED WITH THOSE VETERINARY DRUGS BECAUSE
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE REALLY EASILY STRESSED
WE KNOW THAT THE TRANSPORT AND SLAUGHTER OF HORSES FOR MEAT
BUT WE OFFSET THAT PERHAPS LOWER MILK YIELD THAN SOME OF THE HOLSTEIN COWS WOULD BE DOING WITH
SHE DELIVERS US A REALLY VALUABLE BEEF CALF
HUNTED FOR WHITBY JET BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HELP
I'M GOING TO NAIL THE NUMBER ONE
I DO BUT YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE
THAT MIGHT BE SO
BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE A POLICY FORCE AND AN INSURANCE COMPANY IS TAKING YOUR MONEY EACH MONTH
THE FIRST THING I SAID TO THEM IS
FOUR MINUTES TWENTY SECONDS TO LEAVE A VOICEMAIL
THIS IS A BIG COMPANY
I'M VERY RARELY WRONG
YOU CAN'T GET AMOUNT ADDRESS
THERE IS A FLIP SIDE
ALL LINES ARE BUSY
WE WOULD LIKE A COPY OF THAT PHONE CONVERSATION THERE
NOW WE HAVE REQUESTED THAT
WE CAN'T GET TO SPEAK TO ANY OF THE DIRECTORS
HERE'S THE CRUCIAL FACTOR
AND ONE OF THEM IS THE CUE SYSTEM
IF ALL GOES WELL YE
THERE'S A COUPLE OF ISSUES
WHEN YOU'RE DOING INSURANCE
ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S WORLD OF COMPUTERS AND DATABASES
WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT US IS BEING STORED BY HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES
UM WE DID A LITTLE RESEARCH INTO INTO THAT
MY WIFE AND I ON THE COMPUTER AND
AS I HAVE ON CABOT
YOU'RE ONE IN A MILLION
AND YOU WOULD BE RIGHT
AND THAT'S THE THING HERE
SO THAT MEANS WHETHER THEY'RE KEEPING UP PAYMENTS ON ANY LOANS THEY HAVE
AND ALSO KEEPING UP PAYMENTS ON OTHER CONTRACTS THEY HAVE
THOSE COMPANIES WILL GO TO THE CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES AND PUT DETAILS OF THOSE AGREEMENTS ONTO
EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A PAYMENT
THEY'LL REGISTER WHETHER OR NOT THAT PAYMENT WAS ON TIME
AND IF IT WASN'T
BUT IN MORE EXTREME CASES
PEOPLE FIND THAT THERE ARE LOANS ON THEIR FILE THAT THEY NEVER APPLIED FOR
HOPEFULLY THE GESTURE WE'LL MAKE TO HIM
THIS CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY HAS TURNED DAVID'S LIFE UPSIDE DOWN
IS THERE A FOOTPRINT
SO IT MAY HAVE BEEN RECORDED AND YOU MISSED A PAYMENT IN FACT YOU DIDN'T
AND THEY WILL HAVE FOUND
THIS IS A MISTAKE
THAT IS AN EIGHT YEAR PROBLEM THAT'S FINALLY BEEN PUT TO REST
PUT SOME OF THEM INTO PRACTICE
THE QUALITY DEPARTMENT ARE NOT THE MOST POPULAR AND WELL LIKED DEPARTMENT
HE'S REALLY GENUINE AND HE'S QUITE NICE TO SEE
I'VE NEVER REALLY SEEN THAT IN MANY PEOPLE BEFORE AND HE'S REALLY NICE TO AND JUST GET ALONG WITH HIM
IT'S GOOD FOR ME AND MY FUTURE MAYBE
ALL I KEEP THINKING IS
TELL ME THE TRUTH
IT'S GOT POTENTIAL
THAT'S A GOOD POINT YEAH
GET THE KNOTS OUT AND STUFF BUT IT'S NOT THERE'S
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT EVERYONE DRINKS
MY GOD THIS IS AMAZING
IN NORTHERN GERMANY
THINGS WERE UNSTABLE
YOU CAN'T BLAME HIM
THE ESTABLISHMENT WERE DELIGHTED
THEY FELT THAT EVERYTHING WAS SAFE NOW
THERE WAS A MIX UP
SO ONE CAN JUST WALK UP AND MEET HIM
IT PICKS UP ON ROMAN ANTIQUE ARCHITECTURE
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ROOM IS REFERENCED TO AN ANTIQUE SOURCE
WHICH DOESN'T NEED TO BE HERE
NOT HIDDEN VERY WELL
AND WE ALSO HAD KINGS THAT HAD BEEN RETURNED FROM EXILE
HE WAS QUITE SHY AND RETIRING
HE WAS DIFFICULT TO GET TO KNOW
IN A PROPER COMMERCIAL NATION
WHO WAS SERVING IN THE HANOVERIAN ARMY
SHE WAS DIVORCED BY HER HUSBAND AND HIS PUNISHMENT WAS TO LOCK HER UP IN A REMOTE GERMAN
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY BAD BUT
BUT THERE WAS WORSE
THE COUPLE HAD A SON
THE OCCASION WAS GATE CRASHED BY A FAVOURED COURTIER OF THE KING
WHAT THE GUY HEARD WAS
I WILL FIGHT YOU
A DREADFUL BREACH OF COURT ETIQUETTE
THE PRINCE WAS PRETTY ANNOYED ABOUT THIS AND HE SAID
AND IN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES
YOU ARE A RASCAL
THERE'S AN ACCOUNT OF MONEY PAID FOR A PITIFUL LITTLE SQUARE OF BLACK VELVET
I WILL FIND YOU
THE IMPLICATION WAS
I'LL FIND YOU LATER TO GIVE YOU A PIECE OF MY MIND
BECAUSE OF THE PRINCE'S THICK GERMAN ACCENT
THINGS WERE VERY DIFFERENT
AS WELL AS ANGLICANS
SORT OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL IN EVERY CORNER
THIS FINANCIAL REVOLUTION WAS WELL UNDER WAY
OTHER PEOPLE TRY TO BUY THE SAME SHARES TO SELL OUT TO THEM
BUT THE AGE OF SWIFT AND POPE AND HOGARTH
THERE'S ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING TO JUMP OVER HIGHER STICKS TO GET PRE
ONCE THEY'D ALL AGREED ON A POLICY
HE NEVER REALLY WANTED TO LEAVE HANOVER
HE HAD NO CHARISMA
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S THE QUIET ONES THAT YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH
I THINK I'D SAY NOT SO MUCH LUCKY GEORGE
BUT LUCKY BRITAIN
FOR MOST OCCASIONS IN LIFE
WHICH I SUPPOSE
IN MODERN PARLANCE
IS LIKE SAYING THE CHECKS IN THE POST
COME BACK WITH QUOTES WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
THERE WAS A MAN WHO WAS VERY POLITE
VERY PROFESSIONAL AND SAID
SEND THE EMAIL OVER
AND IF THEY DON'T
YOU ARE ENTITLED TO HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BREACH OF CONTRACT
IT'S TIME TO CHASE UP FIRST NATIONAL COACHES
HE MUST BE BUSY
IT'S THE PRINCIPAL
THEY WERE QUITE POLITE BUT
I MEAN TO PUT IT IN WRITING IN A CONSIDERED LETTER WHICH
WHEN THE BUSINESS LOOK AT IT
THEY PROBABLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING
MY DAY WAS SPOILED
IT WAS NEVER ALL ABOUT COMPENSATION
THEY GOT IT THEY GOT AN APOLOGY
GOT A BUNCH OF FLOWERS
ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS COMPENSATION AND THEIR MONEY BACK
A TIME LIMIT OF AN R AND AN EXPERT TO HELP THEM
I USED TO OWN A COUPLE OF CLOTHES SHOPS
I RECENTLY GOT SOME BEAUTIFUL ART DECK
LET'S RECAP ON WHAT THE REDS BOUGHT
WE'RE STANDING ON THE EDGE OF OUR BED HERE
LONGING FOR THE AUCTION RESULT
WHAT ABOUT THE NO
MINUS FIFTEEN POUNDS ON THAT
WHICH IS LOVELY
HAVING A CUP OF COFFEE IN MY TEA BREAK
MORGAN AND SAUNDERS
BUT FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS
ANYWAY THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT PHIL'S LOT
THE GRAZING IS ALL WITH LOCAL FARMERS
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION
WE'RE WAITING TO SEE
JULES HEADED TO SNOWDONIA
AH WHERE WELSH PONIES BRAVED THE ELEMENTS ALL YEAR ROUND AND WHERE HE GOT SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HE
WHATEVER THE WEATHER
THREE MILES AWAY
YOU SEEM TO BE LETTING YOURSELF GO DOWN THERE
IT'S THAT SWEET
WHERE MATT WILL BE FINDING OUT WHY IT BECAME A POWERHOUSE FOR GROWING FRUIT AND VEG
AND SO WE WOULD HAVE THE REASSURANCE OF A WARRANTY
JUST OUTSIDE OF LIVERPOOL
NOW IT JUST FEELS LIKE
AND NOT SPENT LOTS OF TIME AS A FAMILY
AND VICTORIA WAS QUITE POORLY WHEN SHE WAS FIRST BORN
WHICH SWIFT HAVE NOW EXTENDED TO COMPENSATE THEM FOR ALL THEIR TROUBLE
SO IF YOU GET HOME
WHICH IS OFTEN CONFUSED BUT
WE EXPECTED THE CARAVAN TO BE FIT FOR ITS PURPOSE
I THINK IT WAS JUST A CASE OF
THINGS GET QUITE TENSE NOW
SHE'S A VERY LOVELY LADY
WE REALISE NOW ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS AND AND EVERYTHING ELSE
BUT ALSO VERY UPSET
YOU'VE DONE YOURSELVES PROUD
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
IT WAS MY FAULT
MY QUESTION TO HARVEYS WAS HOW CAN THAT BE WEAR AND TEAR
HARVEYS ARE A VERY
THEY SHOULD HAVE A GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FOR SOME REASON
COULD YOU GIVE US A CALL BACK
THAT ISN'T GOOD VI
COMPLAINTS AND ISSUES LIKE THAT
MAYBE IT'S JUST A BREAKDOWN IN COMMUNICATIONS
BETH IS NOT ALONE
BECAUSE THE DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMER SERVICES HIMSELF RICHARD POWELL HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER CUSTOMERS COMPLAINING ABOUT HARVEYS TAKING A BACK SEAT WHEN IT COMES TO
OBVIOUSLY WHEN IT TURNED UP
WELL THAT'S NO GOOD TO ME
YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S ALL WRONG AGAIN
THAT THEY ARE FIT FOR THE PURPOSE THEY'RE SUPPLIED FOR
AND THAT IT SHOULD LAST A REASONABLE LENGTH OF TIME
IF THAT'S POINTED OUT AT THE TIME THAT THAT PERSON'S BUYING THEM
AND FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAVE GONE WRONG
THIS NEEDS TO BE REPLACED OR EVEN A REFUND GIVEN
BECAUSE I HAD TO LEAVE A MESSAGE
IF YOU UNABLE TO GET THROUGH TO ME
RIGHT LET ME TELL YOU WHERE I AM WITH HARVEYS
THEY DON'T WANT TO SPEAK TO ME MAN TO MAN
WHAT HAPPENED IS
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS
WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE FINDINGS OF THE INSPECTIONS REQUESTED BY OURSELVES WERE CORRECT AND
AS A FURTHER GESTURE OF GOODWILL
IF YOU FEEL YOU'RE RIGHT IN NOT GETTING ANYWHERE
BUT THERE IS A LESSON THERE FOR ALL OF US
WITH ITS DEFECTS
THAT SORT OF EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY
WELL I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD GO FOR ANYTHING LESS
I'M GOING TO BE ELTON JOHN
IT WAS THE FAMILY
RIGHT THROUGH TO ABOUT EIGHTEEN FIFTY
BUT ALL THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE
AND HE'S FROM THE NEIGHBOURING CHESHIRE FIRE SERVICES
HE'S BEEN ON HUNDREDS OF CALL OUTS WITH HIS DOG BRYN
VERY BRAVE MAN AND BRAVE DOG
SO WHEN YOU CAME BACK TO THE UK
YOU SAID TO THE BOSS IN CHESHIRE
GOOD LUCK TO PAUL AND SIMBA
THEY'RE WELL ON THEIR WAY TO BECOMING THE FIRST SEARCH AND RESCUE CANINE UNIT HERE IN THIS REGION
IT'S A CLASSIC OLD BUILDING
MORE LIKE A HAMLET OR SOMETHING OF THAT SCALE
AND A POWERFUL FAMILY
BUT WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE REAL LIFE PERSON
WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT SHE WAS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT
WE KNOW SHE GOT MARRIED TO EARL ERIC IN TEN THIRTY FIVE
THE CONNECTION WITH LADY GODIVA
SO FROM NURSERIES
I THINK WE'RE HAVING TO STRIP DOWN
IF I SAID TO YOU
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT AWAY FOR YOU
BUT YOU CAN FIND THESE THINGS
I DID SEE THE RECEIPT LAST WEEK
AND WHAT ABOUT VALUE
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT VALUE
SO I WOULD SUGGEST PUTTING A RESERVE OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS ON THESE
I ALWAYS LOVE TO BE A BIT SEE A BIT OF SILVER
IT'S NOT A BIG JOB TO HAVE IT DONE
IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE
WE'VE GOT A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF UNIQUE ANIMALS ALL LIVING TOGETHER
NOT FOUND ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
AND THEY HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT BY A STRANGE
THAT'S REALLY HOW YOU SEE THEM
THEY'RE WINNING AND WE'RE LOSING AND WE'VE GOT TO TURN THAT AROUND
WHEN WE THINK OF PEOPLE
IF YOU WORK FROM THE TOP END
THE WORLD'S MOST VENOMOUS ANIMAL AND
TO CELEBRATE THAT
ON THE NEXT LEG
I'LL BE TRAVELLING DOWN AUSTRALIA'S BUSTLING AND BEAUTIFUL EAST COAST
TOWARDS THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF SYDNEY
ARE JUST BEGINNING TO PLAY BALL
NEW PEOPLE MAKE SUCH A CHANGE
WHAT ABOUT CYRIL CONNOLLY HES EVERYWHERE
HE'S AN ELECTRICIAN WITH THE BALLET
WHAT DID YOU DO IN MOSCOW
I KNOW WHAT IVE DONE TO DESERVE HIM
PARDON ME FOR SAYING SO
DOESN'T AFFECT ME
FOR CASH NATURALLY
AND WE WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE TO GO BACK TO THE HOTEL
WHEN RIDING A MOTORBIKE
SEEN THE IMPACT ON THE FAMILIES
I'VE SEEN THEM DECAPITATED
I'VE HAD TO GO TO THE FAMILIES
WHICH IS SO ANNOYING
DON'T ADVERTISE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ON HOLIDAY ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH MAY TAG YOU AT YOUR HOME
IS IT NEXT DOOR TO THE DRAIN PIPE
I KIND OF THOUGHT
WHEN HE WAS DISTURBED
WANTS TO LIVE IN THAT HOUSE AND STAY IN THAT HOUSE
ON THAT OCCASION
IF YOU WANT TO CREATE AN AREA OF WILD FLOWERS
VERY SMALL ONES
AND SOME PLANTS WILL DIE
BUT DON'T PAVE THEM ALL OVER
THIS INTRINSIC PART OF OUR HOMES' DESIGN HAS FALLEN OUT OF FAVOUR AND SIMPLY BECOME A NO
BUT I'M DETERMINED TO SHOW YOU WHY IT'S TIME TO REKINDLE YOUR LOVE OF WHAT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOUR WELLBEING
THERE IS INCREASED USE OF CARS
THEN THINK AGAIN
AND THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY
SO IT WILL GREEN UP IN NO TIME
YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE CAR TRACKS GO
BUT DON'T PAVE THEM ALL OVER
THEY ALMOST CERTAINLY ARE
ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY EARLY DAYS FOR THIS
WHICH ROB WAS TALKING ABOUT
IF YOU PUT THE PLANTS VERY CLOSE TO THE SOURCE OF THE POLLUTION
BECAUSE NEIGHBOURS HELP EACH OTHER
AND THEY HELP EACH OTHER IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS
THEY GIVE MORE BACK
I JUST DON'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD KNOW ONE ANOTHER LIKE THEY DO
YOU MIGHT THINK
I HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR ALL OF THAT
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITES
THE NATURAL WORLD STILL HAS THE ABILITY TO SURPRISE US
WITH THE HELP OF SCIENTISTS
AND THEY COULDN'T SLEEP IN IT
AND SO THEY WERE QUITE UPSET WITH ALL THIS NOISE
AND THEY WANTED SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A FISH COULD MAKE SO MUCH NOISE IT WOULD KEEP PEOPLE AWAKE
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
THE HOUSEBO ORDERS ARE COMPLAINING
IT SOME AND
THEY MAKE NOISE
IT'S ALSO CALLED A HUMMING FISH
THOUSAND SPECIES OF FISH LIVING ON EARTH
THAT CAN BE HEARD FROM A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE
IT HUMS TO ATTRACT A MATE BUT IT ALSO EMITS A SHARP GRUNT TO DISCOURAGE
WHICH IS WHERE THE MALES AND THE FEMALES LOOK DIFFERENT
FOR A LONG TIME
AND IF THEY DON'T FIND ONE WITHIN A FEW WEEKS
THE EYES WENT SOFT
THAT'S REALLY QUITE SIGNIFICANT
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT MORE DEEPLY
YOU'LL FIND THAT THE SURVIVAL DRIVE THAT IS A PART OF EACH OF THOSE ANIMALS' SURVIVAL DRIVE
THEY MIGHT HAVE BEARS IN HOT TUBS
SO EVEN WHEN THEY TURN INTO TADPOLES
AND THIS THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS A MUCH HIGHER CHANCE OF SURVIVAL
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY DO US ANY HARM
IT'S THE PARASITE THAT THEY TRANSPORT AROUND THAT CAUSES THAT CHAGAS DISEASE
OR MAYBE IT WAS ANOTHER WORD
WHAT WE THINK OF AS WEIRD NOW MIGHT BE A LOT WEIRDER IN THE FUTURE
WHAT ALL OF THE STORIES IN THIS PROGRAMME SEEM TO ILLUSTRATE IS THAT A BIT OF UNDERSTANDING AND
IF WE CAN IMPLEMENT A BIT OF LOVE AND RESPECT TOWARDS ALL OF NATURE'S WONDERS
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT THE WORLD WOULD BE A RICHER PLACE
THE WORLD IS ALWAYS GETTING SMALLER
SO AS WE WELCOME MORE AND MORE OF THESE BIZARRE CREATURES INTO OUR OWN BACKYARDS
AND THEN PUT THE ADDRESS
SHAPE UP YOUR GARDEN AND JOIN ME
IT COMES FROM THE GREEK TOPOS
WHY IS IT STILL RELEVANT TODAY
WHY SHOULD WE BE PLANTING IT
DON'T OVERLY IT
YOU WON'T LOOK BACK
BUT HAVING SEEN WHAT I'VE SEEN TODAY
RIGHT FROM THE OFF
THE THING WITH BOX IS THAT IT'S GENERALLY INCREDIBLY EASY TO GROW
WHICH IS THIS HEDGE
ONE OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED CITIES ON THE PLANET
THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT AESTHETICS
PROVIDE A HAVEN FOR WILDLIFE
NEVER REALLY LOOK MATURE
IT LOOKS GREAT AND PROBABLY IS A LOT LESS WORK
IS THIS JUST AESTHETIC
THEY NEED TO LOOK THEIR BEST SHINING OUT IN TWILIGHT
JUST POPPING SOME PLANTS OUT THERE
AND UPSET THAT SOMEBODY COULD DO IT ME
THE CARER WOULD HAVE BEEN ARRESTED
WITHOUT THE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT
BUT HER PHYSICAL HEALTH IS IS REALLY QUITE BAD
WE PLAYED THE TAPE BACK
I ALWAYS TRY TO BE EMPATHETIC
PUT IT BEHIND US
RIGHT AT THE END OF THE CALL
HE WOULD ADD AN EXTRA ELEMENT TO IT
HE WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE
AND THEN PROCEEDED TO GIVE US DETAILS OF BIRTH AN INCIDENT THERE SO
IF YOU'RE A LAW ABIDING MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC
THEY APOLOGIZE TO ME
WE DON'T LEAVE IT LIKE THAT
WHEN I SAW IT IN THE MORNING I THOUGHT YOU
THEY DID LIKE THAT
WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE THAT IT WASN TYPE BECAUSE IT WAS AWFUL
SHE LOVED NEW PLANTS BUT MORE THAN THAT SHE LOVED TO REINTRODUCE THINGS WHICH HAD
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT A PLANT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS ITS PARENT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT
SOMETHING THAT'S IDENTICAL TO ITS PARENT
THE ONES THAT CREEP ALONG THE GROUND JUST UNDER THE SURFACE
BECAUSE IT WAS AT THE AGE OF SEVEN THAT MY INFLUENTIAL GARDENING GRANNY GAVE ME MY FIRST HOUSE
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT
YOU'VE GOT FIVE HOURS
I NEED ORCHIDS TO DISTRACT ME
DURING OUR CAPTIVITY
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SPEND THAT AMOUNT OF THOUGHT
A STONKING FAVOURITE OF MINE
IF YOU WATER IT EVERY DAY
FROM PARTS OF SOUTH EAST ASIA
I WOULD HAVE TO KNOW WHICH BAIT TO USE IN PARTICULAR POND IF I WANT TO CATCH OUT FISH
THAT CAN HAPPEN TO CRIMINALS
RUNNING DOWN THE STREET
WITH THE FORENSIC TECHNOLOGY
IF YOU'VE GOT AN ALARM ON YOUR PROPERTY
SO IT'S THE SAME STEM LENGTHS
LOOK BUT ALSO THEY MAKE INCREDIBLY GOOD CUT FLOWERS AND I WANT TO SEE EVEN MORE OF THEM
FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GROW THEIR OWN CUT FLOWERS
YOU WILL GET A FAR BETTER AND HEAVIER SENSE
AND THEN YOU BREAK THEM APARTT TAKE EACH ONE INDIVIDUALLY AND POT IT UP INTO ITS OWN POT
THE LITTLE PLASTIC ONES
BUT IF MY REVIVAL IS TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT
I'M GOING TO ADD TO THAT WATER SOME FLOWER FOOD
COMFORTABLE VILLAS AND RESIDENTIAL STREETS THAT SURROUND THE CENTRE OF THE CITY
WHICH IS WHAT THEY'RE REALLY ALL ABOUT
AND BUILD UP THE LEVEL OF SOIL
WHICH SITS BETWEEN THE STAKE AND THE TREE
SO IT STOPS THE TWO RUBBING TOGETHER AND DAMAGING THE TREE
AND WE SEE THE ROYALS PLANTING AT LEAST ONE TREE EACH EVERY YEAR
WELL IT'S A SYMBOL OF LONG LIFE AND PROSPERITY
EVEN A GOLD COLOUR
BY PLANTING TREES
YOU CAN REDUCE A CARBON FOOTPRINT AND
REDUCE GLOBAL WARMING
ESPECIALLY IN TOWNS AND CITIES
SO IT'S OPENING IT UP CREATING A WOUND
AND OPENING IT UP FOR INFECTION
FUNGAL OR BACTERIAL INFECTION
OFTEN THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
JUST A VERY SMALL BASIC ONE
WAS TO GET THE INITIAL INFORMATION
HE CAN GO ONLINE AND HE CAN FIND OUT EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT THOSE
AND BY DOING SO
BUT IT'S NOT A VICTIMLESS CRIME
VERY MUCH A CRIME THAT AFFECTS PEOPLE AND AFFECTS THEM QUITE BADLY
JUST SEE IF ANYBODY DO COME
THAT'S ALL THE DESCRIPTION HE GAVE ME
BUT WE DON'T GET NO MOBILE PHONE SIGNAL HERE
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO WE HAD
AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME
THEY MIGHT DRESS SMARTLY OR ACT FRIENDLY SO THAT WE DON'T SUSPECT THEM
DON'T JUST INFORM YOUR BANK
DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES AGAIN
THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU CAN'T AVOID IT
I'M VERY DETERMINED TO GET THROUGH TO THE FINALS WEEK TO MAKE SURE I GET ANOTHER EDIT
AND WHAT WE ACTUALLY NEED IS A DISH OF EXPLOSIVE PLEASURES
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND RELATIVELY FEW EUROPEANS THAT CREATED SOME OF THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS
REPUTEDLY THE FIRST EUROPEAN EVER TO SET FOOT ON BRAZIL DID SO COMPLETELY BY ACCIDENT
THE PORTUGUESE WHO FOLLOWED HIM FOUND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE HERE
COTTON AND TOBACCO THAT THEY SET UP
IT'S LOW TIDE
HARD OUTBACK OF NORTH EAST BRAZIL LIKE
AGAIN THIS IS VERY POWERFUL
SO I MIGHT FIND OUT SOMETHING VERY UNPLEASANT
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO SOMETHING
I THINK HE'S GOING TO READ MY FORTUNE
MAYBE I COULD BE QUEEN
YOU HAVE TO RUN
I'M NOT SAYING IT
IT'S THE FACT THAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT WATER UNDER THE GROUND
YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO JAIL
I'M NOT DOING THIS AND
WE TOOK DOWN THE BLOCKADE
AS A COUNTRY YOU'RE MAKING SUCH A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY OFF YOUR RESOURCES BOOM
IT WILL BE DESTROYED FOREVER THERE
AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT
THE NEW EMERGING ASIAN SUPERPOWERS
BUT MORE THAN THAT
BEFORE COMING HERE
WHEN YOU COME HERE
I CAN GO FROM HERE TO THERE
AND THE REASON WHY IS TO WARM AN AREA WHEN THE AIR IS MIXING IS ACTUALLY HARD TO DO
SOMETHING LIKE HALF THE SIZE OF LONDON
THE MUSIC'S ON AND THEY'RE ALL GOING OFF OUT FOR A NIGHT OUT
IS THERE AN AIRPORT NEARBY
WHICH WEREN'T REALLY GOOD
IN THAT CAR PARK
SHE SHOWS ME THAT SHE HAS GOT WHAT IT TAKES
AND SHE WILL PROVE TO ME THAT SHE IS A GOOD DRIVER
HE'S NOT DANCING
I THINK THAT'S NOT A BAD THING
OUT YOU'VE GONE
AND I WANT US TO CELEBRATE WATER AND WILDLIFE IN OUR GARDENS
SO THAT'S GOING TO HALF THE DIGGING
IF YOU GET THESE SLEEPERS LEVEL NOW
ALL SORTS OF WONDERFUL
INTERESTING NEW PRODUCTS WERE DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE WATER GARDENING MARKET
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO USE TAP WATER
WE WENT TO NORTHUMBERLAND AND SWAM IN THE STREAMS AND THINGS THERE AND THE THE WATER WAS SO
AFTER TALKING ABOUT IT
THAT'LL STOP ANY OF THE SOIL COMING OUT AND A GOOD TIP IS
BEFORE YOU PUT THEM IN THE POND
POND OR FARM POND
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER
A MAN WHO SAT UNWASHED
WHATEVER THE ORIGINS OF CREATIONS LIKE THIS
ONE PIECE OF FOLKLORE SAYS
THE FERNS WILL PROVIDE A SOLUTION
THE ABILITY TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE
BUT TERRIBLY EXCITING AND I HAVE LOVED LAWNS EVER SINCE
IT'S REALLY GOOD TO GO FOR THE EDGES OF YOUR LAWN
IT WILL JUST LOOK REALLY AS IF THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE
SO FOR SOMETHING LIKE A DAFFODIL
I REALLY LIKE SNOWDROPS IN UNDER A TREE
THEY DO REALLY WELL
YOU'LL BE AMAZED WHAT COMES UP AFTERWARDS
AND HOW LONG DID THAT TAKE
IN THE GREAT BRITISH TROPICAL GARDEN REVIVAL
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN THE TROPICS IN MALAYSIA
SHE WANTED HER GARDEN TO CONTAIN ALL THE KNOWN PLANTS ON EARTH
IT'S LIKE A RIVALRY
BUT TO VICTORIAN EYES
THIS TYPE OF PLANTING WAS SO SHOCKING
THIS IS WHAT WE'D EXPECT TO SEE AT THE BOURNEMOUTH SEASIDE
PUT IN THE GREENHOUSE
WE DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY TODAY
IMAGES OF TROPICAL ASIA AND SOUTHERN CHINA COME TO MIND
BUT THEY ACTUALLY COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
COMBINE THEM COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY AND GET THIS TOTALLY CUTTING EDGE LOOK
WHICH IS IN NORWICH
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO
AND IT'S EXACTLY THAT
INCLUDING MOST OF THE VERY COMMON THINGS WE KNOW
BUT OUT THE SIDES
WILL NOT ONLY PUT UP WITH SHADE
THOSE TRANSPARENT SLIGHTLY ELASTIC NOODLES
AT THE LOWEST LAYER
REALLY THERE ARE VERY FEW
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO WITH A LOT OF THINGS HERE AT ABBOTSBURY
IN THE SUMMER AND PROTECTS THEM FROM THE WORST OF THE WINTER COLD
IS DIG THE GUY UP
IT'S NOT NORTHEA SUBURBS ANYMORE
AND WHAT IN HIS UPBRINGING AND EXPERIENCE LED HIM TO CREATE ONE OF OUR GREATEST
THE DUCHESS OF MALFI
AND QUITE AN ODD MAN
QUITE AS SORT OF SUPER SENSITIVE AND INTELLIGENT
AND I JUST ALWAYS IMAGINED HIM TO BE QUITE OUTSIDE OF SOCIETY A LITTLE BIT
OR PERHAPS APPALLED
BUT IF IT CHANCE
THE ACTUAL DUCHESS OF MAFI
WE KNOW THAT THIS WAS WEBSTER'S PRIMARY SOURCE
SHE'S A YOUNG WIDOW
SOME OF THE EXPERIMENTS WE'VE DONE
I THINK WEBSTER'S SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT VANITY MAYBE NOT BEING AS BAD AS YOU THINK IT IS
AND WE READ THOSE STAGE DIRECTIONS BUT
EVEN FROM BEFORE WE COME ON STAGE
ACTORS PLAYING COURTIERS ON STAGE MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES ADDRESSING REAL ONES
AH YOU WOULDN'T SEE THE AUDIENCE
THEY WOULDN'T BE LIT
UM WE WOULD BE LIT
WEBSTER'S FAMILY BUSINESS THRIVED ON TRAGEDY
MINE EYES DAZZLE
SOMETIMES WHEN CRITICS TALK ABOUT THAT LINE
MAYBE WATCH A BEAR BAITING
HAVE A BIT OF A BEER
ESPECIALLY HIS EARLY ONES
HE BORROWS SO MUCH AND SO CLOSELY FROM WHAT HE HAD HEARD IN THE THEATRE THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN
IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE A TWENTY YEAR OLD WEBSTER GOING TO THE NEWLY BUILT GLOBE AND SEEING
BUT THIS WOULD BE HIS FIRST SHOT AT WRITING FOR THE GREATEST GROUP OF ACTORS IN THE LAND
SHAKESPEARE'S COMPANY AT THE GLOBE
FOR A RIVAL COMPANY
THAT COMPANY THEN MADE THE MISTAKE OF STEALING A PLAY FROM SHAKESPEARE'S COMPANY
WHAT WAS HE DOING AT THIS TIME
PERHAPS HE WAS PULLED BACK INTO HELPING OUT WITH THE FAMILY COACH BUSINESS
WE JUST DON'T KNOW
BUT LET'S ALLOW OURSELVES A BIT OF SPECULATION
I KNOW NO OTHER PLAY IN WHICH SO MANY CHARACTERS ARE CRIPPLED WITH DEPRESSION
THAT THESE DEPRESSED TORMENTORS TRY TO DRIVE THE DUCHESS TO DISTRACTION THROUGH THE
IN A BRILLIANT PIECE OF STAGECRAFT
WRITES A HAUNTING LYRIC
AND FOR THE DISMAL MUSIC HE REQUIRED
AND SOMETHING THAT WE'RE QUITE USED TO THESE DAYS
THE ENSEMBLE MIGHT PROVIDE MUSIC FOR DANCING
IT WAS A BOX OFFICE DISASTER
AS FAR AS WEBSTER WAS CONCERNED
AND I CAN'T THINK OF A SHAKESPEARE PLAY WHO HAS THE TITLE ROLE OF A FEMALE
IT'S EASY TO BE DRAWN INTO WEBSTER'S DARK CYNICISM
BUT ALSO FROM HIS OWN TIME AND PLACE
SHE CALLED TO MIND THE IDEALIZED IMAGE OF ENGLAND'S BELOVED QUEEN
IF THERE WAS ONE
WEBSTER OFFERS A GRIMMER VERSION OF SHAKESPEARE'S ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE
BUT THE INTIMATE
COME AND GET ME
I'M GLAD YOU SAY THAT
JUST HOW LONG THE HEART WILL LAST VARIES FROM DAY TO DAY
BLOSSOM TIME BRINGS COLOUR BACK INTO OUR NATURAL WORLD
AND IT'S JUST A FLEETING MOMENT IN THE GREAT SCALE OF THINGS OR TOO QUICKLY
HAPPY FAMILY AT THE MOMENT
HE SAYS THE SHOWERS BEHIND HIM
I TOLD HIM TO GO TO SOUTH MOLTON
I COULD SEE THE SHOWERS AND DARK CLOUDS ALL AROUND US
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY JUST MOVING ALONG LIKE THAT IN TIME
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO
I'VE ALWAYS SAID TO THE RED OSS THAT THEY CAN COME IN
BUT I LOVE COUNTRY FILE
WHAT WILL THE RESULT TELL US ABOUT THE POLITICAL MOOD HERE IN BRITAIN AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PEOPLE THAT THEY WORK FOR THEM
JUST ROUND HERE
I WOULDN'T SAY IT ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY
AND THAT'S COWS
THIS TIME OF YEAR
SO WHAT IS GOING ON
SO ARE SOME MORE DANGEROUS THAN OTHERS
THESE DAYS IT'S A VALUATION OFFICE
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT
HE TOOK THAT IDEA AND THAT CONCEPT WITH HIM WHEN HE MARRIED AND MOVED TO KENT
WHERE HE BUILT HIS OWN THINKING PATH OR SANDWALK
AN ORIGINAL STARFISH SITE IS BEING RESTORED TO HONOUR THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAYED IN PROTECTING
IS NOW FINALLY GETTING
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
WHETHER THERE WAS TB TESTING
WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IS ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE OCCASIONAL INCIDENTS TO KNOW IF THEY ARE
OR IS THERE SOMETHING TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOUR OR OURS THAT COULD KEEP US SAFER
THAT CAN HAPPEN
THEY'RE HAPPY TO HELP
WHAT HE NEEDS IS SOME FINE WEATHER
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU
THE SHROPSHIRE WILDLIFE TRUST BOUGHT PART OF THE ORIGINAL WOODLAND WHERE CHARLES AND HIS FAMILY
SHE'S GIVEN BIRTH TO ONE TELEVISUAL CHILD
IS THE GOVERNMENT RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING
LIKE ITS ELDER SIBLING
I'D HAD THE WONDERFUL IDEA OF SHOOTING THE WHOLE THING ON A SINGLE CAMERA WITH NO EDITOR
I GOT THE IDEA FROM DRINKING THREE BOTTLES OF WINE ONE LUNCHTIME
TO BE FUNDED BY THE LICENCE FEE
FREED FROM THE PRESSURES OF THE MARKETPLACE
THEY RELATE TO A TRUST FUND WHICH I SET UP FOR THE BENEFIT OF ANY FUTURE CHILDREN YOU MIGHT HAVE
ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK A DULL BOY
PEACOCK WANTED LAUGHTER ON HIS CHANNEL
AND NOT JUST LAUGHTER
BUT LAUGHTER FROM SOMEWHERE THAT
NO ONE AT THE BBC HAD EVER DREAMT THERE WAS LAUGHTER
SOMEWHERE FULL OF DREAD DIRT
ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL AND TOTALLY SUPER
AND AS FOR NORTHERNERS
AND HERE WE WERE
IT COULDN'T CARRY ON
AFTER THREE SERIES ON BBC ONE
BUT WAS THAT WHAT BBC TWO WAS REALLY ABOUT
RUMOURS OF A CULTURE OF SEXUAL DEPRAVITY AT TELEVISION CENTRE BEGAN TO CIRCULATE
IT WAS DECIDED TO TACKLE THIS POTENTIAL TIME BOMB HEAD ON
AND WE LIKE IT THAT WAY
WHAT MORE CAN YOU DO
BUT THE WRONG STUFF FOR THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT
THEY WANT TO SAY
AND WE WANT IT NOW
I'D PREFER BERTRAND RUSSELL'S BLOATED BOIL FACED BROTHER BECAME BETROTHED TO YOUR
THE WALL CAME DOWN
A NEW MAN HAD TAKEN CHARGE OF THE WHOLE BBC
TO COME UP WITH WONDERFUL IDEAS THAT THE NATION WILL TAKE COMPLETELY TO THEIR HEARTS UNLESS WELL
THEY'RE SO HARD TO GET IN YOUR EYES
AND YOU'VE GOT JUST FOUR MINUTES
WHICH IS MORE FUN THAN ME BOY FRIEND
AND IF THERE IS
AND TODAY IS NO EXCEPTION
IT'S RIGHT BY THE SIDE OF A CANAL
THE ORIGINAL ONE WAS NOT DOWN TO BE REPLACED BY THIS ONE IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND WHAT'S EVEN MORE
HE WAS A LONG TIME INVALID
HIS WORK WAS DONE BY WIFE AND CHILD
WHEN HENRY SILVER WAS APPOINTED ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF JULY AND PAID TWENTY SIX
JUST WATCHING THE WORLD GO BY
SO IF IT'S PRIVACY YOU'RE AFTER
FIFTEEN TURKISH TIME
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE ANYBODY FEEL SENTIMENTAL
BUT IT WAS GUIDED AT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE
THE QUESTION IS DOES THE AUCTION LOT I'M HERE TO SEE HAVE THE SAME SHOWBIZ QUALITY AND WILL IT HAVE THE
I WOULD PERSONALLY TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OUT AND START AGAIN
THIS HOUSE REQUIRES AN EXTENSIVE MAKE OVER
I KNOW HOW MUCH DAMAGE WAS DONE
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO START BECAUSE
ON A SUNDAY MORNING
AND WE HAD TO MATCH EVERYTHING
VICTORIAN END OF TERROR
IMPROVING GATES AND PARKING AND THINGS LIKE THAT
WHATEVER YOU DO
IF IT'S OLD ARTEX
OVER THIRTY YEARS OLD
SO WHAT YOU MUSTN'T DO IS SAND IT OR BREAK IT
TO GOOD SIZE
NICE HIGH CEILINGS
AND THAT DAMP ISSUE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED
BUT TAKING ON TWO PROPERTIES AT THE SAME TIME IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR ANYBODY
FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW
GREAT RENTAL PROPERTY
THE FOUNDATION BIT OF IT
WHICH WAS REALLY OLD AND FLAKING
I THINK MORE OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY
I DON'T THINK IS THE RIGHT MARKET TO SELL
ESPECIALLY WITH THE GROUND FLOOR EXTENSION
TAKES AWAY THE FACT THAT THE BATHROOM IS NOW ON THE GROUND FLOOR
IT ALL CAME ZOOMING OUT
AND WE CAN SEE WHICH PART OF THE BUDGET IT'S COMING OUT OF
THE PROPERTY IS READY TO MOVE INTO
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU WANT TO GO ALL THE WAY
THE REST GOES TO THE PALACES FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION
SO SO PRETTY MUCH EVERY EVERY SINGLE DAIRY FARM WAS MAKING CHEESE
IT'S THE RAW MILK
THEY WERE RELATIVELY LOWPE
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY HAD
IT'S NOT JUST A PIECE OF ARCHAEOLOGY
THE COMPANY I WORK FOR
O WAS A VERY EXPENSIVE MATERIAL
BUT I'LL SHOW IT YEAH
SO NO DAMAGE DONE
OR PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY HOUSE CONDITION
BUT THEN THEY DIDN'T GET THIS GREEN WITHOUT A BIT OF RAIN
I'M SURE VISITORS WOULD HAVE COME TO THE CASTLE ON THE TRAIN AS WELL BUT
BUT THEY REALLY ARE SO TINY
ROLL ON STOKE V BOLTON
LIVE THIS SUNDAY
IT DOESN'T MATTER THEY'RE ALL THE SAME ON THE INSIDE
THEN BRING IT TO THE BOIL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT TOO TOUGH AND LEATHERY
AND IF IT'S SOFT AND WARM ON THE INSIDE
I PUT IT TO YOU
GUESS WHAT RIGHT
WHAT YOU WEARING
STUFF LIKE THAT
THAT'S ROSE ALL OVER
DOWN THERE A BIT
STOP YOUR TICKLING JOCK
THIS PIECE IS FROM THEIR ALBUM ARAB SPRING
THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH JAZZ ARE OFTEN CRITICAL OF THE PATH WE FOLLOW IMPLYING THAT JAZZ IS
SELF INDULGENT AND IRRELEVANT
BE NICE TO PEOPLE
IT'S A LANGUAGE OF SONG
I'M GOING TO FLIPPING WELL DO IT
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG
AS TIME GOES ON
WILL SHE CONCENTRATE ON THE ROAD
YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO GOD AND BE LIKE GOD
LIKE ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M COMING TO A CITY I DON'T KNOW
SHE'S NOT LOOKING AHEAD
SHE'S NOT PLANNING
IT'S BACK TO DRIVING SCHOOL FOR FORALDO
I FEEL LIKE I WANT TO GO
THEY WERE HIS LIFE
SPORTING AND PHILISTINE ATMOSPHERE
I WAS VERY LUCKY
A BOTTLE OF GUINNESS
HE'D MAKE A TERRIBLE MESS
I CAN RELAX IN IT
WHY SHOULD PEOPLE TRY TO UNDERSTAND ME
IT WON'T DO BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A BIRD
BECAUSE I VERY OFTEN DON'T UNDERSTAND PICA SO MYSELF
PERHAPS HE HASN'T BEEN SUFFICIENTLY RESPECTFUL
I DON'T RECALL IT MYSELF
UM AND HE'S GOT ON VERY WELL WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY
RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH
IT HAD BITE TO IT
IT'S A VERY FAMOUS SEQUENCE BUT
AND THAT ISN'T ENOUGH
ONE MAY BE OPTIMISTIC
WHICH OF COURSE I DIDN'T
AND I WAS SO DEVASTATED BY THIS THAT WHEN I GOT TO THE END
INSTEAD OF GOING TO LUNCH
THEY REMAIN VERY POPULAR EVEN NOWADAYS
SO WHAT WAS ON OFFER
WHEN THE PROPERTY WAS RENOVATED
AND EITHER AS A PLACE TO LIVE OR SOMETHING TO RENT OUT
IT'S A CASE OF BUYING PROPERTIES IN THE AREA THAT YOU KNOW
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE
YOU'VE GOT A MULTITUDE
AND I THINK I'D BE TEMPTED TO TURN THIS FROM COMMERCIAL INTO RESIDENTIAL AND REALLY MAXIMISE MY
A HOUSE TO DO UP
JUST TO SEE WHAT WE COULD DO WITH IT
THAT WAS THE INITIAL THOUGHT TO ACTUALLY COME HERE
COLIN THE BAKER
AS A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY
WE COULD HAVE A FLAT UPSTAIRS AND COMMERCIAL DOWNSTAIRS
WE COULD GO FOR AN ACTUAL
SO THING SO WE'RE STICKING BY KEEPING THE COMMERCIAL AT THE MOMENT AND RESIDENTIAL
IF THE DEMAND DIES OFF A LITTLE BIT
WITH OWNING THE PROPERTY
IF ME OR MY FAMILY WANT TO SET UP A BUSINESS HERE
WE THEN HAVE THE OPTION TO DO THAT
AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS
I LIKE A MAN WHO DABBLES IN PROPERTY
AND MAKING FAIRY CAKES
I'M JUST NOT CONVINCED THAT LEAVING IT PART COMMERCIAL WILL BE THE MOST LUCRATIVE OPTION
I'M REALLY INTRIGUED TO FIND OUT WHAT BUSINESS WILL WORK IN THERE
JOIN ME LATER IN THE PROGRAMME AND YOU CAN FIND OUT
YOU MUST BE ABLE TO GET FIFTEEN GRAND A YEAR FOR THAT
WHY DO YOU LIKE IT SO MUCH
IT WAS COMPLETELY COMMERCIAL
WE JUST PUT IN THE STANDARD APPLICATION TO APPLY FOR RESIDENTIAL USE AND I THINK THE BIGGEST
WE'VE GOT TO COMPLETE THE PROPERTY FIRST
ONE FROM SOMEBODY WANT TO OPEN AN ART GALLERY
AND ANOTHER ONE FROM HAIRDRESSERS ANYWAY
THEY WERE IN THE BATHROOM
AS IS THE NEW BATHROOM
IT'S A GOOD START
BUT THERE'S A SOLUTION
KNOCK THIS WALL THROUGH
HOW WILL THEY GET ON SORTING IT OUT
AH WE WAIT PATIENTLY FOR OUR BUY TO DO WORK ON THEIR PROPERTIES AND SOMETIMES
SO WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH TODAY'S BUYERS
IF ME OR MY FAMILY WANT TO SET UP A BUSINESS HERE
WE THEN HAVE THE OPTION TO DO THAT
BECAUSE ITS A SMALL KITCHEN
TO GIVE IT A BIT MORE ROOM TO ACTUALLY STORE STUFF IN
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE TO DO BUT IT'S NEARLY THERE
WE'RE VERY HAPPY
I THINK HE'S DONE A GOOD JOB ON THE REFURB
I'D EXPECT TO ACHIEVE IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND
THEY'RE VERY MOTIVATED TO GET THIS BALL OF FISH
EVEN BIG FISH THAT THEY DON'T LIKE
TEDDY HAD HIS POISONED BEEF
HE WAS ON THE BOAT
HE WANTS THINGS DONE FOR HIM
THAT'S ALL WE'LL EVER EXPECT OF YOU
IN THE THIRD JOURNEY
I HAVE TO MAKE MY FINAL DECISION
I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE DISH IS GOING
PEOPLE THAT WERE ONCE AFRAID OF BEARS SEE REAL BEARS
BUT NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES
AND I'M NOT BEING POLITE
I' GO HAVE TO TURN BACK AND FIND THE ROAD AT SOME POINT
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER
AND I'M NOT JOKING
YOU COULD ONLY GET THOSE FABRICS ON THE BLACK MARKET
BUT THE SILKS WOULD HAVE BEEN TEN
BROUGHT OVER FROM INDIA TO THE UK
THERE WAS A LOOPHOLE
UM BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED
YOU COULD IMPORTS ONLY IF IT WAS FOR THE EXPORT MARKET
SO YOU WOULD ARRIVE AT THE CUSTOMS WITH YOUR CONSIGNMENT OF CHINTZ
THIS IS WHERE YOU START GETTING THE MARKET FOR CONTRABAND CHINTZ
SPAR A THOUGHT FOR THOSE BRAVE WOMEN WHO WOULD GO DOWN TO THE DOCKS TO GET THEIR HANDS ON SOME
IT WAS GIVEN TO THE SERVANTS AND THEY MADE CLOTHES OUT OF THEM
HOW LUCKY CAN I GET
THE SEWERS HAVE TO USE THEIR CREATIVITY
THEY'RE ALL HANGING OUT
THEY'RE GAINING WEIGHT
RICKY MARTIN CAME OUT THIS WEEK
IF ONLY THEY' SHOW ME MY OPTIONS IN A WAY I CAN UNDERSTAND
I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT ALL THREE POLITICAL PARTIES
SO WITH THAT IN MIND
JK ROWLEY SUPPORTS LABOUR
WE WANT BARACK OBAMA
TELL HIM IT'S ON
WE WERE ONCE GIVEN A QUESTION
PICK THE ODD NUMBERS BETWEEN ONE AND TEN
WHEN SHE DECLINED
AND SHE DIDN'T GET THE JOB
KIDS DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM
SHE'S AN OLD LADY
MADE OF STILTON
DOING A PLAY ABOUT A GAY JESUS IN BIBLE BUT AMERICA
JESUS WAS NAILED AGAINST THE CROSS
AND WHEN I SAY NAILED
IN THE BIBLE IT SAYS THAT JESUS IS IN ALL OF US
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW
THERE'S GOING BE A MYSTERY GUEST WHO'S BEEN IN THE NEWS
AND I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO THAT PERSON IS
ANYONE CAN DO THAT
I THINK THIS FILM IS ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING STORIES YOU'LL EVER SEE
I SORT OF SUMMED UP MY LIFE AND THOUGHT I'M NEVER GOING TO GET MARRIED
YOU I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE A JOB
BUT HE WAS VERY
HE'LL BE BACK FROM WORK ABOUT HALF AN HOUR
HE JUST OPENED THE DOOR
LOOKED AT ME AND SAID
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT GAVE DAD THE DETERMINATION
HOW DID YOU EAT
WHERE DID YOU SLEEP
WHAT DID YOU DO
IT COULD BE YOU
TO MAKE ME LAUGH THE WAY THAT I LAUGHED AND
WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT SPOT
BUT THEN THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM AFTER THE OCCASION
AND AND EVERY TIME WE MET
AND BILLY MADE A POINT OF TRYING TO MAKE ALL THESE SORT OF UP AND COMING PEOPLE
BRUCE FORSYTH AND
AT ABOUT HALF PAST TWO IN THE MORNING I USED
AND AFTER ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN NIGHTS OF THAT
I'LL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN
THE HEAD OF RANK
AND THE RANK ORGANISATION TOOK A CHANCE ON NORWI
BUT FILMS IS A DIFFERENT BEAST
SO IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE INDUSTRY
AS WELL AS YOU KNOW MAKING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
WHICH IS WHAT I ALWAYS THINK
BUT HE WAS BIG IN AS MUCH AS HE DID WHAT HE BLOODY WANTED TO DO
AND NOBODY WOULD EVER TELL NORMAN
WE'LL GET NORMAN NOW
AND THIS HELPED HIM WITH HIS ACT AS WELL BECAUSE HE LEARNT HOW TO TUMBLE AND HOW TO FALL WITHOUT HURTING HIMSELF
AND WAS QUITE ABLE
AH PROBABLY FROM HIS BACKGROUND
I CAN REMEMBER WHEN I WAS LITTLE
AND I WAS SORT OF STARING RIGHT INTO THE CAMERA LENS
AND DAD MADE SURE THAT
THAT MADGE WAS THERE TO LOOK AFTER US AND SHE SHE REALLY WAS A VERY
AND IT WAS ON BROADWAY
WHILST HE WAS WORKING THERE
SO THEY'RE NOT REPEATED NOW
THE WIFE'S A BIT TIRED
THIS ISN'T FOR ME
THEN HIS NAME WAS ON A LIST
I THINK THIS IS A RATHER WICKED THOUGHT
AS I WALK AWAY FROM THE BED HAVING GOT OUT
STEPHEN FREAR SAID
BECAUSE HE CAN DO ANYTHING
HE CAN WIND PEOPLE UP
ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T KNOW HIM
THOUGHT THAT NORMAN REPRESENTED THE DOWNTRODDEN COMMUNIST BY THE CAPITALIST
HE WAS ALWAYS DOING HIS ACT
IT WAS NORMAN BEING NORMAN
A SENSATION I WILL NEVER FORGET
THE QUEEN HAS BEEN VISITING THE ISLE OF MAN
WAITING TO MEET HER WAS THE ISLAND'S ALLEGEDLY MOST FAMOUS RESIDENT AND ROYAL FAVOURITE
WHICH WAS A BIT
I'VE GOT CAT BADGES
THERE'S EVERYTHING HERE
WHAT ARE YOU IN
I LIKE BUYING IT
DON'T BUY FURNITURE
DON'T BUY FURNITURE
QUITE A NICE SHAPE
IT DOES HOWEVER WEIGH NINETY FOUR LBS
I'M THINKING SO OF TWENTY FOUR
SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE FIGHTING
FIRST THING WAS A CHRISTMAS CARD
YOU MAY BE SOME TIME
UM AND HIS TELESCOPES
WHICH SUDDENLY BECAME WELL KNOWN OVER THE WORLD
AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL DOWN TO ME
WHEN THEY WERE EXCAVATING THE CASE
FOUND THESE COINS
SHOW ME THE WAY OUT
FROM ITS HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
SO WHILE WE MAY OVER TO THE AUCTION ROOM
WE' GOING TO LEAVE YOU WITH A LITTLE REMINDER
AND AND AS THOMAS KNOWS
THERE'S SOME GOOD ONES AND SOME POORER ONES
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AND QUITE FRANKLY I WOULDN'T WANT TO
A TRIP UP IN A STATE OF THE ART MICROLIGHT AIRCRAFT
I'M IN SAFE HANDS
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE
LEARN AND APPLY
AND I TELL YOU WHAT
THE AMERICAN MARKET WILL GO POTTY FOR THIS IF WE CAN GET THIS ON THE INTERNET
A FIXED RESERVE AT TWO
I CAN SEE THIS DOING TWO
BUT UNTIL THE NEXT TIME
AWAY FROM THE ROOM
IT'S JUST ABOUT TO START BECAUSE
FOR THE FIRST TIME REALLY
THAT NO MATTER HOW DREADFUL THE ALIENS WERE
THAT'S A REALLY LOVELY GESTURE
GET AWAY FROM ME
THERE MIGHT BE CUBS THERE THAT HE COULD TAKE EASILY
AND HOW IT FUNCTIONED
IT PICKS UP MEAT
YOU STAND A GOOD CHANCE OF BEING ABLE TO ISOLATE INDIVIDUALS
MODERN HUMANS SPREAD RIGHT ACROSS EUROPE AND ASIA
BUT AS THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM APPROACHED AND CONDITIONS WORSENED
THEY SOUGHT REFUGE IN THE SOUTH
THE CLIMATE WAS HARSH
SOME KIND OF MATERIAL
IS A FANTASTIC EXAMPLE OF THE INGENUITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF OUR SPECIES
THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS HERE AT ZARAISK HAVE UNCOVERED SOME TRULY BEAUTIFUL AND
THEY WERE IN THE AGE OF THE ROARING TWENTY S
THIS WAS THE TIME IN WHICH
WHAT'S THE NAME OF YOUR OTHER LEAD DOG
THEY USED TO SAY TO US
YOUR HOUSE IS MORE LIKE A MUSEUM
I THINK HE WAS QUITE IMPRESSED WITH MY ITEMS ACTUALLY
BUT OF NO GREAT QUALITY
ARE YOU SURE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT
SOMEBODY WANTS TO AVOID IT
UM FIVE QUID LUCK MONEY
OR MAYBE IT WAS BUILT IN SECRET BUT
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT
THANKS VERY MUCH
YOU CAN HAVE THEM
I'M BIDDING NOW
I'VE SOLD THEM FOR THREE HUNDRED QUID ALL DAY LONG IN NORTH YORKSHIRE
THEY DEFINE ROCK AND ROLL
AND THE FIRST RULE OF BUYING ANY POT IS IF IT'S DAMAGED
SO WHERE IN THE WORLD AM I
CROATIA DOES REPRESENT GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY
THEY CAME TO THE UK IN THE FIFTY S SO I WAS BORN HERE
WHAT IDEALLY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
I WOULD SAY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND
IT'S RIGHT UP THERE AT THE TOP OF YOUR BUDGET
REALLY POSITIVE START
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HAS TO BE THE ICING ON THE CROATIAN CAKE
WITH A PRICE LIKE THAT
AND THEY ALREADY LOVED THE PROPERTY
IF THEY DO WANT TO FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THE BUSINESS
AND WITH OUR MYSTERY HOUSE
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT A HEALTHY BUDGET
THAT IS THE QUESTION
I'M SO DELIGHTED YOU'RE COMING BACK IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS' TIME
THAT'S IT FOR OUR HOUSE HUNT ON THE DALMATIAN COAST IN CROATIA
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN DESPERATE TO RETURN TO HER PARENTS' HOMELAND
THE LAST FEW DAYS HAVE REALLY CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE FOR HIM TOO
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE RETURNING TO DUBROVNIK QUITE SO QUICKLY AND REVISITING ONE OF OUR PROPERTIES
COMPARE THE SIZE OF THE STRONG WORKS TO THE SIZE OF THE BOAT
TAKE ME IN AT SIXTY FIVE
IF YOU WANT TO BE REALLY PICKY
THE MAIN ARMAMENT OF THE SHIP
WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH
FROM ALASKA TO THE HUDSON BAY
RAN DNA ANALYSIS ON IT AND THE DNA ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT IT WAS MADE OF MASTODON BONE
AND RIGHT ABOVE THAT ARE THESE CLAY DEPOSITS FROM AN OLD LAKE BED AS WELL
SO WE GET THESE TWO DIFFERENT TIME FRAMES REPRESENTED FROM THE VERY END OF THE ICE AGE
WE SEE FOR INSTANCE
OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN JUST ENOUGH HUNTING AND SCAVENGING BY HUMANS TO BE UNSUSTAINABLE
AND WE'D LIKE TO STUDY THEM
SHOWN OF COURSE WE LIKE HISTORICAL OBJECTS
WHERE WE STAYED LAST NIGHT
BUT IN THE OLD DAYS
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BACK TO A MIRROR
YOU ASK ME THAT
JUST LYING THERE
THESE ARE VERY DESIRABLE
THEY'RE SO ELEGANT
OF A PARTICULAR WAY OF DOING THINGS
JUST OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD
WHICH MIGHT SEEM LIKE A STRANGE THING TO DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS A GREAT PIECE
AND WHILST IT'S SENDING YOU ON THIS MISSION
WELL I'M INTERESTED IN
AND EVERY MORNING SHE'D
I'D GO INTO HER BEDROOM AND SHE HAD A BOX OF TREASURES BY THE BED
THEY WERE DOWN THERE FOR THREE YEARS
I MEAN THEY MUST HAVE TAKEN OUT FIVE OR SIX
PEOPLE DO COLLECT BELLLAINE BOTTLES FOR THEIR CERAMIC IMPORTANCE
LET'S JUST LOOK AT THIS
I LOVE IT DEARLY
A MAN WHO ACTUALLY
THIS IS THE PAMPHLET THAT WE GIVE TO VISITORS WHO COME ALONG TO THE ROADSHOW
WHICH IS A BIG PROGRAMME OVER THERE
WATCHED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE
THE ORIGINAL AND THE BEST
MAKING THEIR WAY TOWARDS THE SURFACE
CRACKS WHICH EVENTUALLY GOT SO BIG THAT THE LAND SLOWLY BEGAN TO FRAGMENT
AFRICA STOOD ALONE
IT FORCED ANIMALS TO ADAPT TO A MYRIAD OF DIFFERENT COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS
BUT A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO
IT UNDERWENT THE MOST COLOSSAL GEOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION
FAR MORE INTERESTING
IF HERODOTUS HAD ONE OF THESE
I THINK IT'S EVEN MORE VALUABLE
EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL
BECAUSE IT'S A WINDOW BACK IN TIME
WHICH UP UNTIL THIS POINT IN TIME HAD BEEN RELATIVELY STATIC
THE INCREDIBLY THICK AND ANCIENT TANZANIAN
THAT MOST ANCIENT OF LINES
THE IMMENSE GEOLOGICAL FORCES ARE AT WORK BENEATH MY FEET ARE PREPARING TO REDRAW THE AFRICAN
FIND OUT WHERE IT IS AND WHAT COUNTRY I'M IN
BUT THE BUILDING I'M STANDING ON TODAY WAS ERECTED BY THE TURKS WHO USED IT AS A PRISON
SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS HERE IN CYPRUS
AND PAPHOS IS CONSIDERED QUITE DESIRABLE
AND THEREFORE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE
IT GROWS AND IT DEVELOPS
THE HOUSE ITSELF IS IS VERY HOMELY
I'M GOING TO GO ONE NINE FIVE
I LEFT BEHIND A VERY HAPPY COUPLE
EVERYTHING SEEMED TO GO WELL
THAT HOUSE TICKED ALL THE RIGHT BOXES
I'M GOING TO MIX IT UP A BIT
SHOW THEM TWO VERY DIFFERENT PROPERTIES AND ALSO CHALLENGE THEM AND MAKE SURE THEY KNOW EXACTLY
THERE'S ALWAYS THE ELEMENT OF GAMBLE
BUT IT'S PERFECT
AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO A THING
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
AND FOR BOTH OF US
AND WE'VE GOT A NICE COFFEE AREA AND EVERYBODY SITS DOWN
AND IF YOU DO THAT
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT
AND NOW THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT HOME
IT'S A FUNNY THING ON BARGAIN HUNT
AND THESE ARE THE BARGAIN HUNT RULES
AND HER DAUGHTER
EACH TEAM GETS THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IN AN ART SHOP FOR THREE ITEMS WHICH ARE THEN SOLD AT AUCTION
THERE YOU HAVE IT
WHICH HIS DAUGHTER
THAT'S IT THOUGH FOR THE REDS
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU GAVE HENRY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE POUNDS OF LEFT OVER
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IT JUST HIT THE
I NEED TO GET BACK ON THE TROPIC OF CANCER
WITH CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS
BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SIZE
WE CAN DO THE TEST
THIS IS THE NINTH SERIES
CAN YOU BELIEVE
WE STARTED THIS WHOLE THING
IN ALL THAT TIME
DRINKING BEER FROM THE MINI BAR
I GET TO SEE MY KIDS EVERY
EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS
I HOSTED THE FIRST TWO SERIES
YOU MAY REMEMBER AND
SAY THAT TO YOU
I THINK I CAN SAY THAT HERE IN IN IN HAMMERSMITH WITHOUT BEING ACCUSED OF BRAGGING
I'M NOT A HOARDER
SOMETHING ELSE I DON'T MIND YOU KNOWING ABOUT ME
I LIKE TO GET RID OF STUFF WHEN IT ACCUMULATES YOU
I'D REALLY LIKE THAT
I WANTED TO JUST TALK IT THROUGH WITH YOU A BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT HAPPENED TO ME
SORRY TO REPORT
WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT
BECAUSE I WAS GIVEN
GAVE ME A FOOT SPAR
I'M A BOOK PERSON
TAKE IT TO A CHARITY SHOP
THAT MEANS IT'S YOURS
MEAN IT WAS IT WAS EMBARRASSING
HEALTH AND SAFETY THAT'S A MINEFIELD
VERY MUCH TO OUR COMEDIANS TONIGHT
JUST TO SAY ONE THING
THE STRESS FOR PEOPLE TOO
IF YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
BUT ACROSS THE REGION
THEY'RE A FRAGMENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN CONTINENT
IT WAS TWIN WITH ANTARCTICA
THE OVERALL WINNER WILL BE VOTED FOR BY COUNTRYFILE VIEWERS
AND WHOEVER TAKES A PICTURE THAT THE JUDGES LIKE BEST
BUT IF YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES
WELL WHY NOT GIVE IT A GO
THE THEME IS ANIMAL MAGIC
AND IT'S WIDE OPEN TO INTERPRETATION
BUT ENTRIES MUST INCLUDE EITHER FARM OR WILD ANIMALS
YOU CAN SEND IN UP TO THREE PHOTOS
WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN THE UK
WE WANT HARD COPIES AND NOT EMAILED OR COMPUTER FILES
A LIMESTONE VALLEY CARVED OUT OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS BY THE RIVER DOVE
AND IT'S UNUSUAL IN THIS AREA TO FIND MIXED HOARDS OF IRON AGE AND ROMAN COINS
BUT AT SOME OTHER SITES WE FIND EVIDENCE THEY HAVE BEEN BURIED ON KIND OF RITUAL SITES
A RANGE LIKE THIS SIMPLY PROVIDES AN ENJOYABLE AFTERNOON
IT GOES HAND IN HAND WITH IT
IT GENERATES ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND ENCOURAGES LANDOWNERS TO FARM IN A MORE
WHETHER YOU THINK THAT SHOULD BE CELEBRATED
RECOGNISED OR JUST MERELY TOLERATED WILL DEPEND ON YOUR VIEW OF USING THESE THINGS
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A DILEMMA ON OUR HANDS
THIS LAMB IS THIRTY SEVEN KILOS
OR DO WE WAIT FOR THE LAMBS TO GROW AND GET MORE KILOS ON THEM
SO WE HAVE THIS DILEMMA
BUT ACTUALLY TRIMMING IT RIGHT BACK WILL BE HARMFUL
AND THEN FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE BEEN DOWN TO LESSON ONE
THERE MUST BE A LOT OF DIFFERENT LINKS THAT WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTING TO FIND OUT
AH FREEDOM IN TERMS OF DRESS
WE DO A LOT OF WALKING
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT
ROBERT THE BRUCE WAS ABLE TO EXPLOIT THE CIVIL WAR THAT EDWARD WAS OBLIGED TO WAGE AGAINST HIS
WOULD HAVE REALISED THAT EDWARD WAS IN A DIFFICULT AND WEAK POSITION
IMAGINE THE EMOTIONAL TURMOIL OF WAITING ALL OF THAT TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FRIEND WAS BURIED
IT FEELS LIKE A RIVER HERE
YOU'D BE SLIDING
WHEN THE SCOTS COME DOWN TOWARDS THEM
MOVING FORWARD AND JABBING FORWARD
CLOSING THE GAP BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE CAVALRY
BUT THE REALITY IS
THE FORMAT REMAINS THE SAME YOU BUZZ IN
ANSWER A STARTER QUESTION CORRECTLY
SO YOUR TEAM CAN TRY SOME BONUS QUESTIONS
THE YEAR AFTER THE WIN
THEY'VE NEVER ACTUALLY ADMITTED THIS
I THINK THAT HELPS ENORMOUSLY
WHICH IS ENTIRELY FULL OF PENS
WHICH IS QUITE HIGH
IT WAS HALF HORRIBLE
AND THEN FROM PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE ON THAT
IT EXPECTS TOO MUCH OF THE VIEWER
OLD INSTITUTION LIKE MAEN
SEVEN OUT OF EIGHT US
THERE'S THAT PSYCHOLOGICAL MENTAL ASPECT
I REALLY WANTED TO SORT OF SEE IF I COULD GET ANYWHERE NEAR THAT LEVEL AND MAYBE ONE DAY BE ON THE SHOW
I SEE THAT THAT THAT I DID DO VERY WELL
I'D RATHER KEEP IT THAT WAY
THEN THE REALITY
DID YOU SEE LUCY'S FACE
I WANT AN EMPIRE LINE
I CAN TELL YOU NOW
HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE
I KNOW YOU'RE POSITIVE
I KNOW YOU NORMALLY THINK YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING
ABSOLUTELY LIKE A PRINCESS
EVERYBODY WILL GET SOMETHING WHO'S COMING
CAN'T DO IT HALF AND HALF
NEXT ON THREE IT'S SLUM SURVIVORS
BUT DELICIOUS TO EAT
EVERYTHING HAS ITS SEASON AND WITH THE ONSET SUPERMARKETS
BUT IT'S WILD BIRDS
BUT SEASONALITY DOES NOT ONLY AFFECT FRUIT AND VEG
I WANT TO MAKE THIS OLD FAVOURITE BUT REFLECT A BIT OF MODERN BRITAIN BY INCORPORATING AN EXOTIC TWIST
SWEET OR SAVOY
AS I SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE SIMPLE RECIPES
IT'S HEAT AND FLAVOR
IF YOU THINK OF A BELL PEPPER
AND EDDIE TURN OFF
AFTER FIVE DAYS
THE LONGER YOU PLAY THIS GAME
WE'LL GIVE YOU THIS A WEEK
EVEN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS MATCH OF THE DAY
HE WILL PLAY GOLF
SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE DID
AND THAT'S DOWN TO HIM AND JAN
WHEN WE DID START CHATTING
HE SAID HE WORKED IN INSURANCE
YOU HAVE TO PLAY
WHAT ABOUT THE MOTHER
BEING SUCH A NERVOUS PLAYER AND HATED THE PRESSURE OF HAVING TO PLAY
DID THEY WANT YOU TO PLAY ON
THIS IS AMAZING
SAID THOSE DAYS ARE OVER
AND THEN DID SOME WORK FOR SKY
THE PREISESHIP SEASON IS UNDER WAY AGAIN
MATCH OF THE DAY RETURNING ON A REGULAR BASIS AFTER A GAP OF FOUR SEASONS
AND TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AFTER THE VERY FIRST PROGRAMME
WHEN HE SAYS SOMETHING
THREE PLAYERS HAVE DEPARTED
THE TRICK IS ALWAYS
BUY WHEN YOU'RE STRONG
SOME OF THAT ALAN HANSEN
WHEN HE'S NOT ON THERE
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LOVELY
THERE ARE DIFFERENCES ON EITHER SIDE
BY THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
CANNONS HAD DEVELOPED ENORMOUSLY AND IN RESPONSE TO THAT
THE FRENCH IN PARTICULAR DEVELOPED THE ABILITY TO CREATE RAMPARTS WITH VERY
IT'S A STATEMENT OF POWER AND WEALTH
AND I WANT IT BIGGER
AND HE SAID TO THEM
THERE WAS ALREADY AN AVENUE RUNNING EASTW WEST
BECAUSE THEY HAVE METAL CORNERS AND THEN THE OAK SIDES GET REPLACED AS NEEDED
ALTHOUGH IVE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE ARE RECORDS IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY OF THEM COLLAPSING AND
THE WHOLE THING FALLS APART
AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE INSTRUMENT
AND IN THAT SPIRIT
JOSEPHINE WAS A REAL GARDENER
BUT HER REAL PASSION
SO ALL THE FORCES OF THE FRENCH EMPIRE WENT BEHIND THIS QUEST
BECAUSE WHEN SHE DIED IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN
THERE WAS NO INVENTORY OF ROSES LEFT BEHIND
FROM MY GRANDFATHER
SORT FRENCH PEOPLE
AND HE NEVER WOULD HAVE TRIED IT
AND PEOPLE WENT TO EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS BOTH FINANCIALLY AND WITH INGENUITY
NOT SO SKILL
AND TO IMPRESS PEOPLE
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A WET PLACE
THEIR FORMAL AND POMPOUS
HE WAS ONLY NICE WITH
AND ALSO BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT IT'S TEMPORARY
THE WOODS HAVE EXPLODED OUT
AND SO THE RELATIONSHIP HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED BETWEEN THE INSIDE AND THE OUTSIDE
AND THAT MEANS THE FRAMEWORK
AND CERAMICS AS WELL
THAT'S THAT'S A VERY FAIR WAY OF SUMMARIZING
I JUST THINK IT'S QUITE STYLISH
I'M DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THAT
WE'RE HEADING OFF TO BUCKINGHAMSHIRE
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
BIT OF AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD IF YOU HAPPENED TO BE A CEILING PAINTER
FALLING FROM A LADDER
BECAUSE IT'S THE COMMONWEALTH GAMES
THEY WOULD SING THAT
BUT BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES
WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND ARE ALL COMPETING SEPARATELY
WHICH I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS
SONGS OF PRAISE VIEWERS
I FEEL SO PROUD
I CAN JUST IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE
I LOVE ALL THE COLOURS
ALL THE FLAVORS
WHEN I WAS FIRST MARRIED
THE GREEN GROCERS WERE FULL OF GREEN PEPPERS
BUT IT'S A WONDERFUL CUT OF MEAT
I DON'T KEEP THOSE
BECAUSE THEY GO OFF SO QUICKLY
IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS
I'VE ALWAYS USED IT
I'M FLAVOURING IT WITH CHOCOLATE AND ORANGE
TODAY THAT OBJECT IS GOING TO BE ME
THIS PLACE IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING WIND SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF TWO HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT'D BE LIKE
THEN EVERY NOW AND THEN
SO IT'S A MASSIVE RISK
VERY WORRIED THAT THIS COPYING
WE'VE GOT A CHANCE
A LOT OF THEM HAVE COME FROM THE VILLAGES OF WHEREVER THEY ARE
WHERE THEY HAD THIS INFLUENCE
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT
AND WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD REPORTS
I'VE JUST HEARD
BECAUSE THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP THE BIRD TO BE QUIETER
WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT TO AVOID
WHICH WAS VERY CLOSE TO HIM
AND THEN WHEN HE HADN'T EVEN BOTHERED TO GO
BECAUSE OF HIS AGE
WHERE ITS BONES ARE SOLID AND STRONG
YOU AIN'T GOT NONE OF THAT
THAT IS MY GENUINE OPINION AND
THIS ISN'T OUR COUNTRY
AND THIS IS AN EXPERIENCE I WANT TO ENJOY
KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT
IF YOU DON'T LISTEN
I'M HA ME
WHICH IS WHY I'M NOT UPSET
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY TALENT
SO I'M GOING TO GO ROUND THE WORLD LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT COOKING JOBS
BASICALLY COOK MY WAY AROUND THE WORLD
YOU'RE MORE ROUNDED THERE THAN YOU ARE NOW
WHERE I TRAINED AS A YOUNG CHEF MANY YEARS AGO
AND ALL YOUR STRESSES
AS WE SAW EARLIER
IT DOES WARM THE HEART
IT STIMULATES THE BLOOD CIRCULATION
BUT IT WAS TREATED WITH REVERENCE
THIS WAS THE ERA OF THE GREAT BRITISH CHOCOLATE MANUFACTURERS CADBURIES
AND IT'S NOT JUST TASTE
AFTER ALL THIS TIME
I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT
JACK WAS THE BEST GOVERNOR I'VE EVER HAD
SOME DAYS HE'D TURN UP
OTHER TIMES HE WOULDN'T
WHEN HE WAS THERE
TELL US THE TRUTH
SO WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW
IT'S SOLID GOLD
MORGAN COULD EASILY HAVE GOT BACK TO BARNES
ONLY TEN MINUTES AGO
FRANCE HAD BEGUN THEIR MAP BASED ON A NATIONAL TRIANGULATION ONE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THE BRITISH
AND WHEN IT'S WINTER
AND WHEN THE WATER'S DEEP ENOUGH
WITH SO MUCH DEMAND AND A LIMITED SUPPLY
THEY DECIDED TO REDRESS THE BALANCE
THAT MEANT THAT THIS SAUCER HAD TO HAVE COME FROM ONE SHIP AND ONE SHIP ONLY THE SS
OVER IN BELGIUM
SO LET'S PUT IT IN WITH A VALUE OF SEVENTY FIVE TO ONE HUNDRED
YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT DOWN AND
HOW OLD ARE YOU
HOPEFULLY IT'S BEEN VIEWED HERE
WITH PLENTY MORE ANTIQUES TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER
SO THERES MORE SURPRISES TO COME
BUT THAT LAST LOT HAS GIVEN ME A GREAT IDEA
SO WHEN THE POWER LOOMS STARTED
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A TRADITION OF HANDLING WEAVING IN THE VALLEY
THAT GROWS ON BREAD
FOR MOST PEOPLE
STILL INVOLVED VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT NUTRITION
YOUR AVERAGE PERSON DIDN'T GET THE SORT OF MEDICAL TREATMENT WE'D EXPECT
IT WAS INFECTIONS THAT CARRIED A LOT OF PEOPLE OFF
MEDICAL CARE WAS FAIRLY BASIC AND
URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS
PARTICULARLY SOLDIERS IN WARS WHERE THE OTHER
THE OLD WAY OF THEM BEING TREATED WAS SO INEFFECTIVE THAT MOST OF THEM EITHER DIED THERE OR
LOTS OF MEMORIES HERE
I'M HOLDING BEDS
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
GOING THROUGH THOSE FIELDS OF RED PEPPERS
AND THEN CLIMBING UP INTO THE THE LOFT WHERE THEY'RE SMOKING THEM
BOTH CROPS CAME FROM THE AMERICAS
AS INDEED DID THE CONQUERORS OF AMERICA
BUT TO ME THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FLAVOUR IN SPAIN
THE FIRST TIME I TASTED PIMENTON
WHICH IS WHAT THEY MAKE OUT OF THESE PEPPERS
I JUST THOUGHT I'VE GOT TO HAVE MORE OF THAT
AND THAT IS WHY I'M HERE
LOOK FOR STONES IN THE LENTILS
NEVER FOUND ANY STONES
TWO ABORTIVE ATTEMPTS
THEN HE CAME BACK TO SPAIN AND SOMEHOW MANAGED TO CONVINCE THE KING
I WILL BUY MY FREEDOM
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL
WAS EXTREMELY HARD AND OBVIOUSLY
BUT IT'S NOT TRUE
AND IT'S TAKING OFF
PEOPLE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND AND AND CRAVE IBERICO
AND IT'S SO GOOD FOR THIS AREA
THIS IS SPECIAL
YOU CAN GO UNTIL SOME OF THEM
HAD A PALACE NEXT DOOR
AND WHEN HE CAME BACK
VERY ROUGH VOYAGE BACK FROM THE AMERICAS
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT
HOW DID PEOPLE COOK FOOD I MEAN
I KNOW I'M A BIT PATHETIC
HOW COULD THAT BE
THE WORD WHERE IT CAME FROM
IF YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY
YOU SPRINKLE IT WITH POMEGRANATES
BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER
LIKE LONDON WHEN THE SUN SHINES BUT
BUT HERE THE SUN SHINES A LOT MORE
I FEEL THE SAME AS ANNIE IN A LOT OF WAYS
ABOUT THE CITIES
ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE
ABOUT THE WAY OF LIFE AND EVERYTHING
TOOK AWAY ALL THE VEGETATION
WE WERE FIVE MONTHS WITHOUT A BRIDGE
AND AFTER A WIND
WHEN THE LEMONS ARE RIPE
HUNDREDS OF THEM FALL ON THE ROAD
AND WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO DRIVE OVER THEM
BACK IN THOSE DAYS
MORE THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
AND TODAY THE CIDER AND PERRY THAT'S PRODUCED HERE IS PROTECTED UNDER EU LAW
AND IT SHARES THE SAME STATUS AS FRENCH CHAMPAGNE OR
ITALIAN PARMA HAM
A COUNTY WITH A LONG AND RICH HISTORY OF CIDER PRODUCTION
BECAUSE IN THE OLD DAYS
CRIME LEVELS ALSO MAKE FOR PRETTY INTERESTING READING
THEY SAY JUST A MINIMUM OF TWO BEDROOMS
AND ALL OF THIS FOR THE PRINCELY SUM OF FOUR FIFTY
AND WE'VE GOT FAMILY THAT LIVE NOT VERY FAR FROM HERE
THEY'VE BEEN DROPPING STEADILY HERE OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND CURRENTLY RUN AT THIRTY TWO PERCENT
YOU DO HAVE A COUPLE OF NEIGHBOURS
LET'S MEET THEM
IDEALLY KITCHEN BREAKFAST ROOM
IT'S REALLY NICE
HALF A MILLION POUNDS
THEY ARE A GREAT WAY OF BUYING AND SELLING
AND THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
IF THESE TWO WANT THIS PLACE AND IT IS REALLY OF INTEREST
IF YOU'RE HOPING FOR SOMEWHERE THAT IS CLOSE TO TRANSPORT LINKS WELL
KIND OF SCENARIO
IT IS A TWENTY MINUTE WALK TO THE TUBE
LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT PRICES
BECAUSE THE AVERAGE PRICE OF PROPERTIES AROUND HERE IS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX
WHAT ABOUT UPSTAIRS
IF IT'S TOO BAD
IS THAT THE RIGHT DECISION
AND HOW ABOUT THAT TIGHT TIMESCALE
WILL SHE GET IT DONE IN TIME
YOU CAN FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW
BUT IT'S ALREADY BEEN CONVERTED INTO FIVE DWELLINGS
BUT THEY DO COME UP AT AUCTION
ON THE PLUS SIDE
YOU MAY HAVE TO HONOUR LONG TERM AGREEMENTS
HALTING ANY REFURBISHMENT PLANS THAT YOU MAY HAVE
WITHOUT EVEN LIFTING A FINGER TO DO ANY WORK
THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE A GREAT INVESTMENT FOR SOMEONE LET'S SEE WHO THAT WAS WHEN WE WENT TO
BUT WE HAVE SEEN THAT WE'RE ACHIEVING BETTER RESULTS IN IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO POSE ANY PROBLEMS
SEE WHAT'S COMING UP AND WE IDENTIFIED FIVE PROPERTIES IN THE AREA ON THAT PARTICULAR AUCTION
GIVE THE OUTSIDE FACADE A FACE LIFT
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY STILL NOT WITHOUT ITS RISKS
LET'S HOPE THERE AREN'T ANY COMPLICATIONS ALONG THE WAY
YOU CAN SEE HOW THE COUPLE GET ON LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
BUT IN THE FUTURE
THE FINISH IS EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD
IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING
THEY ARE A DISASTER
I FOUND IT REALLY INTERESTING
CERTAINLY UPSTAIRS THE BEDROOM ACCOMMODATION
GROUND FLOOR WISE
GIVING IT AN OPEN PLAN LIVING KITCHEN FAMILY ROOM
WHICH IS VERY POPULAR AT THE MOMENT
WE STARTED A LITTLE BIT BEHIND BECAUSE OF HAVING TO RENOVATE FLAT FOUR AND THEN MY MAIN BUSINESS
THEN I WOULD CONSIDER A MARKETING VALUE OF TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY
CONSIDERING THE YIELD
WOULD BE A REASONABLE FIGURE
IT WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED PO
WITH A VIEW OF ACHIEVING ANYWHERE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
I WOULD SAY HE'S GONE A LITTLE BIT OVER THE TOP FOR FOR THE AREA THAT THE PROPERTY WAS WITHIN
BUT THE FINISH IS OUTSTANDING
SO A GOOD PROJECT FOR SOMEBODY
MY BROTHER'S A JOINER
WELL WHAT A GREAT PROJECT FOR PAUL'S FIRST FORAY INTO THE WORLD OF PROPERTY INVESTING AND
I'M SURE HE'LL DO JUST GREAT
WHICH EATS INTO VALUABLE SLEEP TIME
BUT NOT IN THIS CASE THOUGH
BECAUSE HAMPTON STATION IS A BRISK TWO MINUTE WALK THAT WAY AND THE HOUSE WELL IT'S HERE
IT'S GOT THREE BEDROOMS AND IT HAD A GUIDE PRICE OF THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY
IT WON'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE
SPEND THE CASH AND PUSH THIS PLACE TO THE LIMITS OF ITS VALUE
BUT I AM GOING TO PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE
WHAT IF YOU DIDN'T DO THAT
THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT SAYS LOTS OF BUYERS THESE DAYS ARE RELUCTANT TO BUY A HOUSE THATS REACHED ITS FULL
THEY WANT TO STAMP THEIR MARK AND DO SOME OF THE GRAPH THEMSELVES
BUT THEY FORGET THE SCHLEP THE STATION
I'M SURE THE HOUSE WILL BE FAB WHEN SHE'S FINISHED
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW TO TREBLE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE
HALFWAY FREE THE PROJECT
YOU'D BE LOOKING AT AROUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE
IT COULD BE TWO HUNDRED
IT COULD EVEN GET UP TO TWO FIFTY THOUSAND
HANDY FOR THE LAKE DISTRICT
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU PAID FOR IT
WHAT ABOUT THE BUDGET
A COMBINATION OF REASONS
FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS I LIVED NEXT DOOR
WE'RE NOT TOTALLY SURE
IT'S REALLY LOVELY
LOVELY FAMILY HOME
THERE'S A NICE KITCHEN DINING AREA NOW
WHICH IS ALSO PAVED
SO HAVE OUR BUYERS BEEN HELD UP OR RACED AHEAD
WE'LL HAVE MORE TALES OF THRILLS AND SPILLS FROM THE AUCTION ROOM FOR YOU NEXT TIME
MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND TOGETHER
WE'VE TAKEN HUNDREDS OF TRIPS TO AUCTION HOUSES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
WE'RE POOLING ALL OF THAT KNOWLEDGE TOGETHER TO HELP YOU GET SOME INSIDE INFORMATION
THINGS LIKE SPICES AND TOBACCO AND SUGAR AND COFFEE
IT WAS STILL VERY EXPENSIVE AND ONLY THE VERY WEALTHY AND THE PRIVILEGED COULD AFFORD TO DRINK TEA
IF IT'S DONE BADLY
IF YOU'RE IN ANY DOUBT
LEAVE THINGS ALONE
WAS JUST A PIECE OF COLONIAL HISTORY
AND UM TO BE HONEST WITH YOU
AND IT WAS STRUCK
FOURTH THE CUSTOMS AND EXCISE MARK
AND THE LETTERING ON THE FRONT WAS SO
THE BEER RATION WAS THE RATION OF BEER
THAT'S A PINT OF RUM AT MIDDAY
THAT'S WHAT WAS SO SPECIAL ABOUT IT
AND BUT YOU CAN'T THEN OPEN IT AND HAVE A LOOK AT THAT WONDERFUL INTERIOR
AND THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING IS WHEN YOU'VE ACTUALLY CRACKED IT
PERHAPS THAT REPRESENTS A SLIGHTLY LIMITED MARKET FOR IT
IT'S LIKELY WHEN WE GO TO THE AUCTION
I THINK IT SHOULD MAKE
FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS AND I THINK IF IT WAS REPRESENTED IN ANOTHER AUCTION
PERHAPS WITH WITH OTHER ITEMS OF AH OF A SIMILAR NATURE
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
AND RAILWAYS WERE ALL EXPORTED ACROSS THE GLOBE UNDER THE EMPIRE
BUT THERE'S ONE THING IN PARTICULAR THAT'S REMAINED ASSOCIATED WITH ENGLAND
ANYBODY CAN VISIT THE MUSEUM
PEOPLE LIKE COOK
EVEN IF IT'S A BAT THEY HAVEN'T USED
GET THEM TO SIGN IT
AND WHEN IT DOES
WE LIKE TO FOLLOW IT UP ON TRADE SECRETS
YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING
WHAT'S HE GOING ON ABOUT
PUT THEIR LITTLE PENNY IN
IT'S BY A GERMAN MANUFACTURER
IF WE GET TO THE RIGHT MONEY
AND THAT IT WAS A VERY SEXY
I'VE BEEN HERE TWICE BEFORE
THAT'S THE WRONG WORD
GARDENS HAVE DIFFERENT STYLES
AND HOW TO MIX THEM AND HOW TO USE THEM
I HAVE TO KNOW MY FLOWERS AND THE COLOURS HOW HOW TO USE THEM
NEARLY FORTY YEARS LATER
YOU CAN'T CAN'T SEPARATE IT
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT
WHICH IS NOT A WORD YOU'D ASSOCIATE
NOT VERY MANY PLANTS
COME AND JOIN US
NOW IT'S ALL EVIDENT VISIBLE
JUST WORKS SUPERBLY WELL
REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU WORK WITH A SPACE
THINGS MAKE SENSE
LINES GOT COMPLICATED
A STAFFORDSHIRE BLANK
TWO OR THREE ITEMS
NOT A GREAT DEAL
THAT IS SOMETHING WHICH A SOLICITOR WOULD HAVE TO CHECK OUT
WHEN IT COMES TO DOING WORK AT THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY
SO THAT'S DEFINITELY A CONSIDERATION
IT COULD CERTAINLY BENEFIT FROM SOME INTERNAL RECONFIGURATION
GOOD ONE TO GO FOR
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS OUT AT THE TIME
IS THIS ONE ODDBALL ENOUGH FOR THEM
HOW WILL THEY GET ON RENOVATING IT
OVERGROWN LEVEL SITE WITH A SINGLE GARAGE IN SITU
THE IMPORTANT GUIDE PRICE FIFTEEN
PERHAPS CLEARING AWAY ALL THESE BRAMBLES WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE
WHICH IS A GOOD START
AND THAT WILL DETERMINE THE SIZE OF HOUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD HERE
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE COUNCIL ALLOWING SOMEBODY TO BUILD A HOUSE HERE
THAT COULD MEAN GETTING PERMISSION TO BUILD HERE WELL
IT MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU THINK
BECAUSE OF THE PARKING RESTRICTIONS
I THINK THERE'S ELECTRICITY
SHOULD YOU WANT TO BUILD
PLANNING IS NOT GUARANTEED
GET THE PERMISSION
AND THIS COULD BE A REALLY SHREWD BUY
BUT IF IT GETS TURNED DOWN
YOU'VE GOT AN EXPENSIVE PIECE OF LAND WITH DRASTICALLY LIMITED POTENTIAL
SO IS IT WORTH A PUNT
LET'S SEE WHO THOUGHT SO AT THE AUCTION
THIRD AND LAST TIME
WHEN THEY SAT DOWN AND LISTENED TO WHAT WE HAD TO SAY THEY LOOK
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT POSSIBLY THE LAND BEHIND US
AND WE NOW WANT TO BUILD A HOUSE
WE KNOW THERE'S A SHORTAGE AND THE PRESSURE ON EALING COUNCIL TO TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE HOUSING
AND THEN THEY DID ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND LISTEN TO US AND
WHAT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT IS TRYING TO MAKE THIS HOUSE AS PART OF A CLOSER TO
BUT IT DOES PAY OFF IN THE LONG RUN
AND I THINK SOME CLIENTS DON'T ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE BEGINNING
BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING TO PAY OUT MORE MONEY BUT
WE HAVE A PLOT OF LAND WHAT CAN WE DO
IT'S A RISKY STRATEGY
BUT I FOR ONE HOPE THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL
JOIN ME LATER IN THE PROGRAMME TO SEE IF IT ALL WORKS OUT FOR THEM
WE'LL NEVER KNOW
IT'S A LITTLE ON THE COMPACT SIDE
AND NOWHERE MORE SO THAN ON THE FIRE BREASTAS
BUT IT'S AT THE EXPENSE OF
JUST TAKE IT OUT
WHAT'S ACTUALLY GONE ON
IS AT SOME POINT
WILL THEY WELCOME US BACK WITH TALES OF SUCCESS AND SOARING PROFITS
AND EVERY TIME YOU MAKE AN APPLICATION
AND TO APPLY FOR THE PLANNING PERMISSION
SO I HAD TO RING THEM BACK
BECAUSE IT'S A MODERN
IT WAS CONTRACTORS
WHICH I MANAGED TO GET IN THROUGH THE WEEK
MAYBE THE KITCHEN
IT WAS HARD WORK
SO I PROBABLY WON'T BE DOING ANYTHING LIKE THIS FOR A GOOD WHILE
THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IF IT WAS A HOME TO BE LIVED IN
AND I SUPPOSE I WAS BROUGHT UP WITH ECCENTRIC PEOPLE
AND THEY SEE THE MAGIC OF THE COAST PATH
THEY SEE THE MAGIC OF PEMBROKESHIRE
AND IT PUTS THEM OFF
IT'S ALSO THE SETTING FOR DAVID NICHOLS' NOVEL STARTER FOR TEN ABOUT A STUDENT WHO COMPETES IN A
I'M BENJAMIN MOON FROM MARKSBURY AND BATH IN NORTH EAST SOMERSET AND I'M STUDYING FOR A PHD IN
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM EAST LONDON AND I'M STUDYING CZECH AND RUSSIAN
DURING WHICH TIME HIS PUPILS INCLUDED THE ART CRITIC BRIAN SEWELL
THE BROADCASTER ANDREW GRAHAM DIXON STUDIED THERE
AS DID THE DIRECTOR OF THE TATE
THE LOSERS COULD PLAY AGAIN IF THEIR SCORE IS AMONG THE FOUR HIGHEST LOSING SCORES FROM THESE FIRST
I'M FROM THE NEW FOREST IN HAMPSHIRE AND I'M STUDYING HISTORY OF ART
I'M MATTHEW MCLEAN
BONUSES ARE TEAM EFFORTS
YOU'LL HEAR A PIECE OF MUSIC FROM AN OPERA
YOU BOTH HAD THE RIGHT COMPOSER
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A MUSIC ROUND NOW
THE PILGRIM FATHERS
WEREN'T ON THE MAYFLOWER
AND STAYED MANY GENERATIONS
BUT THEY ENDED UP GOING WEST TO AMERICA
IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF OUR SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NEW WORLD
OUR FIRST POLICE FORCE
WHICH IS GREAT NEWS
IT WAS A THREE BEDROOM TERRACE
YOU'VE GOT LOCAL FACILITIES
YOU MUST DEFINITELY
THE LEGAL PACK REVEALS THAT THERE IS
IF YOU WERE APPLYING FOR A MORTGAGE
AND IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO MOVE INTO THE PROPERTY AND THE LEASEHOLDER SHOULD JUST HAPPEN TO COME BACK
WELL YOU CAN IMAGINE THE COMPLICATIONS
IF YOU'VE READ THE LEGAL PACK
I WOULD SAY AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND
IT'S A NICE ENOUGH PROPERTY BUT IT COULD FAIL AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL WHEN IT COMES TO THAT WHOLE
ESPECIALLY IF YOU WERE TO BE LOOKING TO BUY THIS WITH A MORTGAGE
THINGS COULD HAVE GONE HORRIBLY WRONG FOR TAMVIR THERE REGARDING THE LEGAL
THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED BUT DEFINITELY LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FOR ALL
JUST A FEW MOUNTAINS LEFT TO CLIMB SORTING THIS PLACE OUT
BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY GET THAT CHECKED OUT
I THINK THE MARKET'S
BUT YOU WEREN'T THAT PASSIONATE ABOUT THE PROPERTIES
YOU PUT YOUR BUILDERS IN
TO TAKE IT YOU KNOW TO A TOP END HOUSE
COSY FAMILY HOUSE
YOU'RE BUYING THE THE THE FOOTPRINT
TO GET TO THE FAMILY MARKET YOU NEED TO HAVE A BIG MASTER BEDROOM
AN EXTRA BATHROOM
IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BUILDING
CHARLIE SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF A PART TIME DEVELOPER BUT HE REAPS BIG TIME REWARDS
THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT
JOIN ME LATER IN THE SHOW TO SEE THIS HOUSE FINISHED
FAR SUPERIOR IN FLOOR SPACE
YOU'RE ALMOST GOING TO ADD MORE THAN A THIRD OF FLOOR SPACE TO THE HOUSE
IF YOU DID THE LOFT CONVERSION
YOU'VE GOT TO CONSIDER THE FIGURES AND
ALTHOUGH THIS AREA IS UP AND COMING
IT'S NOT THERE YET AND YOU CAN'T GET TOP DOLLAR FOR HOUSES AROUND HERE NO MATTER WHAT YOUR
SO IF YOU DID ALL THAT WORK
SO AND I THINK HOPING TO MAKE A PROFIT ON IT
VERY GOOD JOB ALL THE WAY THROUGH
I WOULD STRIP IT RIGHT BACK BACK TO THE WALLS
FROM THE OUTSIDE
A FAIRLY STANDARD TERRA BUT
BUT WALK THROUGH THAT FRONT DOOR AND IT DOES HAVE A LOT OF ADDITIONAL THINGS GOING FOR IT SO
WHAT SHALL WE SAY FOR THIS ONE
WELL I THINK JOHN'S CHOSEN WELL FOR HIS FIRST PROPERTY INVESTMENT VENTURE
AND ESPECIALLY IF HE'S ONLY GOT THE EVENINGS AND THE WEEKENDS TO DO IT IN
SO WILL HE MAKE THAT TIMESCALE AND DO IT WITHIN BUDGET
BECAUSE TIME IS MONEY
COZY FAMILY HOUSE
AND THIS IS A REALLY NICE SURPRISE BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAVE YOU GOT THIS BIT
I THINK THAT THE OWNER HAS DONE A GREAT JOB IN TERMS OF THE REFURBISHMENT
WE ARE EFFECTIVELY LOOKING AT ABOUT ALMOST A FIFTEEN PERCENT INCREASE ON LAST YEAR
WITH A VIEW OF TAKING ANYTHING SORT OF NORTH OF SEVEN HUNDRED
EVERYBODY PROBABLY WENT OUT ON AN OPERATION WITH THAT THOUGHT IN MIND
THIS WAS MY OFFICE
AND FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS
WITHOUT A DOUBT
I SLIDE IN UNDERNEATH NINE
I REMEMBER IT ON HER MANTELPIECE
I'D LOVE TO BE TALKING ABOUT TWO THREE FOUR HUNDRED
WE ARE COMING BACK LATER ON IN THE SHOW
BUT HE'S GOT MORE THAN JUST ARTISTIC INTEREST IN THE FOREST OF DEAN
BEEN HERE NOW FOR
THIS IS MY FOURTH YEAR
IT'S JUST THE CHAINSAW
ME AND A BIT OF WOOD
VERY FAMOUS AND TRAGIC ENDING
ONE SHELL FROM THE BISMARCK HIT THE HOOD
GIVE THE AUCTIONEER A LITTLE BIT OF DISCRETION
A PLACE THAT'S INSPIRED ARTISTS AND POETS ALIKE
BUT TODAY I'VE COME TO FIND OUT HOW THIS SIMPLE LANDSCAPE COULD HAVE INSPIRED ONE LOCAL LADY
WHILE SHE WAS TRYING TO GET PREGNANT
WENT OFF IN ONE OF HER LUNCH BREAKS TO THE VICTORIAN ALBERT MUSEUM
I WANT TO DO THIS
THIS IS SOMETHING I CAN DO AT HOME
WENT OFF TO TRY AND BUY THE PRINTS
COULDN'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE
SHE WAS ALREADY PREGNANT
TOOK THE BUS TO JOHN LEWIS
WAS TERRIBLY NERVOUS WAITING TO SEE THE BUYER
AS FAR AS SHE HERSELF WAS CONCERNED
AND BY THIS TIME SHE HAD FOUR CHILDREN
IT WENT PUBLIC AND
THAT CRUCIAL FAMILY BOND WAS LOST FOREVER
HOW DIFFERENT THE COMPANY MAY HAVE BEEN IF LAURA HAD LIVED ON
WE WILL NEVER KNOW
HE'S A BIRMINGHAM SILVERSMITH
YOU COULD SAY OUR WORK IS NOW DONE
IT'S CHEERIO FROM CARDIFF
ROAD SIGNS WARNING ABOUT
THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT
SOME BOUGHT FOR JUST A FEW THOUSAND QUID
NOW THIS VILLAGE HAS A STRONG SENSE OF COMMUNITY
AND IT'S ALL FOCUSED AROUND TODAY'S AUCTION LOT
AND IT IS GRADE TWO LISTED
WILL IT RETAIN ITS PUB SPIRIT AND OPEN THE DOORS TO THE PUBLIC ONCE MORE
WE'VE GONE OUT FOR THE DAY
IF YOU'RE PAYING NOT THAT MUCH FOR THIS HOUSE
BUT IT'S A BIG HOUSE AND IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY
WE'VE GOT PEOPLE COMING IN
GOD DECORATOR
BUT WE DO ALWAYS GO BACK
IT'S THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
IT WAS ALL HANDS TO THE BARREL
WE'D LOOK TO ACHIEVE ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND
AND ESPECIALLY FOR AG
THEY NEED TO RENAME THAT TO A NIGHTMARE WEDDING
I'LL REPHRASE MY QUESTION
WE WOULD HAVE CREDIT TO IT IMMEDIATELY
IF I STOP DOING WORK FOR THIS GUY
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED POUND AND I WAS WELL OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE
BECAUSE BEFORE THAT
CATEGORICALLY SAID THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PAY OUR WAGES IN FRONT OF THE PREVIOUS OWNER
FIVE MINUTES BEFORE
AS WE EXPECTED TO
IT WASN'T A VAST AMOUNT OF MONEY
SHANAYE WALKER WAS FOUND WITH HEAD INJURIES IN NOTTINGHAM
BUILD YOUR OWN TOLL ROAD
THE WORDS OF PRINCE WILLIAM
QUIET EVENING HERE ON THE NILE
BUT IN THAT SITUATION
AND WHY NOT JUST RELY ON THEIR REAL LIFE COUNTERPARTS
I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING ROBOF FROGS
BY READING LIPS IT IMPROVES OUR SPEECH COMPREHENSION AND WE THINK THAT THE FEMALES MAY BE DOING
THE WAY THAT IT'S EVOLVED TO OVERCOME EXTRAORDINARY HURDLES TO ENSURE THAT
HE'S MAKING THAT NOISE TO ATTRACT HER
ANIMALS FIND AND KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE ONES THEY LOVE
BE IT HUMBLE OR NOT
NOBODY SHOULD ACTUALLY QUESTION HIM
WHAT HE SAID WENT
IT ALSO BORE HIS SCOTTISH GREAT SEAL
WHICH IS WHERE CHARLES WAS NEGOTIATING WITH THE SCOTS
AND TO THE PAGEANTRY
I'M THE FIFTY NINTH OR THE SIXTITH BLACK ROD
AND THEY ECHO TO THE PRESENT DAY
YOU CAN SEE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN IN MODERN HISTORY
PEOPLE JUSTIFY WHAT THEY DO BY SAYING
WHEN PEOPLE SET ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBOURS
PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE GROWN UP ALONGSIDE
THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER ESCAPE ATTEMPTS
AND ALL THE WHILE
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD BEEN MADE UP OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MPS
AND IF HE DID REGAIN HIS RIGHTFUL THRONES
THE HOLE IN THE CONSTITUTION WAS KING SHAPED
THE WIT WAS A LITTLE EDGY
IF I'D KNOWN HOW WELL I'D BE RECEIVED
AND YOU END UP WITH RICE LIKE THAT
THEY'VE NOT TRIED TO RAISE ANY MONEY
APART FROM ONE GENTLEMAN HAD TO BE REMOVED BY THE POLICE ACTUALLY ARRESTED
WHICH WE NEVER WANT TO SEE HAPPEN
FINAL ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN HEARD AT HIS MURDER TRIAL
BRITAIN SAYS IT'LL HELP WITH AIR DROPS TO ASSIST STARVING REFUGEES
THE VERDICT ON OSCARTOR WILL BE MADE ON SEPTEMBER THE ELEVENTH
I GET A SENSE OF VANILLA OR I GET A SENSE OF CHOCOLATE OR CARAMEL
WE LOVE WATCHING THE PROGRAM UM
AND WE ALWAYS SIT THERE GOING
THAT WON'T DO IT
MIX THIS FLOUR WITH WATER
IT IS ABOUT NUMBERS
SOMETIMES I GET SOME LOOKS
ONE ONE SEVENTY WOULD BE BRILLIANT
THAT'S NOT MUCH
THE THREAT OF CULLING
TO ME IT'S COMMON SENSE
PUTTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE UP
SO HE OVERSTOCKS
AND UNLESS THAT HAPPENS
AND SHE SAID TO ME
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT PARKED TOO FAR AWAY
THERE'S VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT GAUCI BUT
AND UNUSUAL GEMSTONES EVEN MORE SO
WITH A COMPANION
HE SEEMS TO BE SAYING PEACE FOR OUR TIME
IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU MENTIONED PURPLE
AND THAT IS ALL I KNOW ABOUT THEM
AND I FIND THE BOOKS AND
WHEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY HOLD THE FABRIC THAT THE ARTIST HAS PORTRAYED
WHAT DID YOU PAY
AND THE TROUBLE WITH COLLECTING OLD VICTORIAN MEDALS IS THERE'S VERY LITTLE RESEARCH
IF THE RECIPIENTS ARE STILL ALIVE
I THINK BECAUSE THEY'VE NO ONE TO PASS THEM DOWN TO IN THE FIRST PLACE
THEY'VE BEEN IN THE CUPBOARD FOR A LONG TIME
AND THAT'S WHERE THEY'LL STAY
AND IT WAS HER COLLECTION OF A LIFETIME
I INHERITED THEM
IF I EVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE THIS AGAIN
SO THEY DECIDED TO MAKE OTHER THINGS
UM BECAUSE I KNEW A LITTLE OF THE HISTORY OF THE HERD
AND THE STAKES COULDN'T BE HIGHER
FAIL AND THEY LEAVE WITH NOTHING
BUT I STILL WORRY ABOUT IT
AND YOU NEED TO GET AS MUCH MARKET AS YOU CAN
WE'VE HAD THREE ORDERS IN FACT UP TO DATE
THE FIRST ORDER WAS FOR ABOUT TEN
IT'S BEEN ALREADY SUCCESSFUL IN THE US
I'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS A LONG TIME
I THINK DEBORAH WAS REALLY CONVINCING
AND HE TOOK THE LEAP OF FAITH
THEN YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF A WINNING TICKET
NEVER GET VERY FAR
MY NAME'S DAVID
AND THIS IS PHIL
WE NEED TO TURN THIS INTO A CRAZE
NOT JUST TRICKLE FORWARDS AND GROW STEADILY
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD
BUT I'M AFRAID I'M NOT GOING TO INVEST AND I'M OUT
THAT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE WITH OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEUR
WHO HAS A NEW TAKE ON THE TRADITIONAL MARSHMALLOW
WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT MARSHMALLOW
WHICH IS KIND OF STRANGE TO ME THAT YOU'VE GONE DOWN THE MARSHMALLOW ROUTE WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY MORE
AND WHAT I WON'T BE DOING IS
A LOT MORE TO THE TABLE
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS A CHECK
YOU CAN'T SAY NO AND THEN CHANGE YOUR MIND
SO IT WAS A BRAVE DECISION FOR HARRIET TO WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING
JOIN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT
AND ALL OF TONIGHT'S PITCHES
THE STAR OF THE KIDDING
PLAYS MARGARET OF DENMARK
THAT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY DREW ME TO THE PROJECT
WAS I READ THE PLAY AND AND THAT THOSE TWO CHARACTERS
NOT THAT LONG AGO
I THINK I'M PROBABLY ONE OF THE LUCKIEST INCOMING ARTISTIC DIRECTORS EVER TO HAVE THESE THREE
ABOUT IT THAT MADE ME GO
IF WE CAN GET ALL THREE OF THESE ON IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH ONE COMPANY OF ACTORS
AND YOU CAN SEE MORE ONLINE AT BBC
AFTER YEARS OF DELAY
LET'S TAKE A TRIP NOW IN THE COMPANY OF FORMER ROOFER
NOW FULL TIME WRITER
FORGET ME THE FUTURE
WITH QUEEN MARGARET
IT'S A KIND OF SPARKLING
IT WAS A WET WIND
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WHEN I THEY FIRST PITCHED IT
EVEN THOUGH THE THE POSSIBILITY HAD STARTED TO BE DEBATED
WE DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS GOING TO BE A REFERENDUM THIS YEAR
QUITE EARLY ON IN THE WRITING PROCESS
TO PERSUADE THE LIKES OF YOU AND ME TO GO AND SEE THEIR SHOWS
WHEN THERE WERE A NUMBER OF SHOWS WHICH HAD ENGAGED COMPANIES FROM ABROAD JUST AFTER THE WAR TO
SOME SHOWS ON THE WE
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BURN THE CANDLE EVERY WHICH WAY
COULD I COME ON YOUR SHOW AND TALK ABOUT MINE
THERE ARE MORE THAN THREE
THOUSAND SHOWS ON IN EDINBURGH
AND IT'S SAID YOU'RE NEVER MORE THAN FIVE METRES AWAY FROM A COMEDIAN TELLING A JOKE ABOUT SCOTTISH
YOU CAN PROBABLY COMMAND A DECENT VENUE HERE
BUT LESSER FRY MAY HAVE TO SETTLE FOR SOMETHING ALTOGETHER MORE INTIMATE
SOME VENUES ARE DOWNRIGHT WEIRD
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH TO GO TO
SO IT MIGHT HAPPEN
THAT'S THE CITY
YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO HEAR I'M BACK
BUT NOW IT TAKES PLACE IN MORE THAN THIRTY GALLERIES
EVERYTHING FROM MING DYNASTY PORCELAIN TO PINBALL MACHINES
YOU CAN PLAY THE GAMES BUT YOU CAN'T TOUCH THE POTS
WHO WAS BORN IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT
THERE'S A REAL PRECARIOUSNESS
ENJOY THE VISUALS AND REFLECT ON THESE THINGS
I DON'T KNOW WHY
AND WHEN I DID HEAR THE MUSIC WITHOUT SEEING DANCING TO IT
THIS YEAR'S FESTIVAL HAS A SOUTH AFRICAN FEEL
WITH A RAFT OF PRODUCTIONS CELEBRATING A MOMENTOUS ANNIVERSARY
BUT ALSO REMINDING US OF A TROUBLED PAST
TRY AND FIND SOMETHING THAT I COULD APPROACH LADYSMITH BLACK MUBAZO WITH
KNOW THEY'LL COME UP WITH SOME STEPS AND THEY WILL SHOW US SOME STEPS AND
THE TERRITORY CAN BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOW WANTING TO KNOW
IT WAS NOT UNTIL LATER ON IN MY LIFE
WHEN I BEGAN TO BE AN ARTIST
THAT THESE STORIES STARTED COMING BACK TO ME
THE STATE OF VICTORY
THE STATE OF WINNING
IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY TODAY
HAVE THE ZULU STATE OF MIND
WHERE FAMILIES WERE NOT STABLE
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TURNING AGAINST EACH OTHER
WE'RE BACK IN THE TRAMS NOW
THELOO HIGH SCHOOL CHOIR HAS NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE UMLAZI TOWNSHIP BEFORE
BUT THIS MONTH THEY'RE IN EDINBURGH PERFORMING TO RAISE MONEY FOR COMMUNITY PROJECTS BACK HOME AND
ANT HART AND MICHAEL MCINTYRE
TO HELP CELEBRATE ITS THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY
PLEASANT VETERAN ARTHUR SMITH TAKES US THROUGH THIS VENUE'S AMAZING HISTORY
THE FIRST ONE WE PLAYED HERE IS NOW THE CABARET BAR
THERE WAS ONE NIGHT
AND ONE DAY SHE SORT OF FLUNG OPEN THE WINDOW AND SERVED A PINT OF BEER THROUGH THE WINDOW
WE SAW HER LAST YEAR
BY THE END OF OUR OF OUR STINT THERE
WHERE'S MY PLAQUE
WHICH IS REALLY WHAT INDEPENDENCE IS ABOUT
MEMBERS OF THE CULTURAL COMMUNITY ARE ALL WAEDING INTO THE REFERENDUM DEBATE
I THINK THE ARTIST'S JOB AND AT ANY TIME IN ANY SOCIETY IS
THEY ARGUING THE TOSS IN PUBS AND CLUBS AND WORKPLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY
IF I'M FEELING A BIT BY MYSELF AND YOU I'VE GOT SOME TIME TO MYSELF
WHERE YOU'RE ON A STAGE DISCUSSING THE WORLD ECONOMY OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS
OR THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DEFEND IT PUBLICLY
AND THEY USE THIS IDEA THAT
THERE'S A DYNAMIC
GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW
THEY ARE PERFORMING LAMENTS
GEORGE R R MARTIN
PROFESSOR MARY BEARD'S GUIDE TO COMEDY IN ANCIENT ROME
WE GO ON TO BELGIUM
NOW WHAT'S BELGIUM FAMOUSUS FOR
IF YOU DON'T GET UP
JACKIE ASHLEY AND TINA BROWN AS WELL AS THE NOVELISTS HELEN FIELDING AND ZOE HELLER
I'M FROM NORTHALON IN NORTH YORKSHIRE
YEAH AND I'M STUDYING PHYSICS
I'M FROM RED DEER
CANADA AND I'M READING FOR A DF IN ENGLISH LITERATURE
I'M REBECCA MCCANER FROM CROYDON IN SURREY AND I'M READING FOR A IN CLINICAL NEUROLOGY
WHICHEVER TEAM PROVES TO BE THE CREDA LA CREME WILL PLAY AGAIN IN THE SECOND ROUND
I'M ANTHONY MARTINELLI
I'M FROM HERTFORDSHIRE AND I'M STUDYING MEDICINE
AND YOU FEEL REALLY STUPID
ONIONS AND WHATNOT
YOU'RE WELCOME TO KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND USE HIS OVEN ANYTIME YOU WANT
BUT YOU WOULDN'T TREAT MEN
AND IF WE TAKE THIS TARGET AND WE SAY THIS MIGHT BE A BOMB DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND WE DROP
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LIKE
WORSHIP AND DRINK AND COFFEE
PAPRIKA IS PLAYFUL
THE CARPEDIAN MOUNTAINS
WHICH MAKES THE PASTRY REALLY STRETCHY
WE ARE TOGETHER FOREVER
I'M THE ROCK N ROLL ONE IN A BAND
WE CAN JUST GET AWAY FROM EVERYTHING AND JUST ENJOY IT AND
SHE'S MY ELDEST CHILD
A GLOBAL HOLY WAR AGAINST THE BRITISH EMPIRE
DEPENDING ON WHICH ESTIMATE YOU TRUST
BY SOME RECKONING
SO ALL OF GERMANY'S POTENTIAL ENEMIES IN A GREAT POWER WAR HAD THIS POTENTIAL ACHILLES
THE KAISER AND HIS FOLLOWERS DREAMED OF SPREADING GERMAN POWER
HERE AT THE EMBASSY
SO PRISONERS FROM THE FRENCH AND THE BRITISH COLONIAL ARMY
PERHAPS DRAWN BY MERE MAST HIMSELF
ALONG WITH FOUR NAMES
A CHARACTER TRAIT THAT WAS TO PROVE DISASTROUS FOR LITERALLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ON THIS
BUT IT WASN'T HIM WHO PAID THAT COST
AND I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT DESCRIPTION
YOU WOULD NEVER
BUT THE FRENCH ARMY WELCOMED THEM INTO THEIR RANKS
BY FRENCH TI WHO TOOK PART IN THE RECAPTURE OF FORT DUMON AT VERDUN
A CENTURY LATER
BECAUSE FOR WEEKS NOW
A CHANGE OF PACE
AND WHAT THAT DOES
BUT WHEN YOU BAKE BREAD
EVERY ONE IN TEN OR TWO IN TEN
NOW HOW MANY OF YOU THOUGHT THAT NUTELLA WAS EITHER SWISS
GERMAN OR SOME SCANDINAVIAN PRODUCT
EVERYONE SEEMS TO LIKE THEM AND THEIR JUSTIFICATION FOR IT IS
BUT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE
AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY
WHEN YOU YOU AREN'T PART OF THAT COUNTRY
I JUST THOUGHT I'LL JUST USE THE LOO
I HAVE BEEN A CUSTOMERIA
EVEN THOUGH IT'S GOT WAIT LIT UP AND YOU'VE CLEAR
AND WORST OF ALL
FOR SOME REASON
BECAUSE I'VE GOT YOUR GET OUT OF JAILRE CARD AND WHATEVER I SAY NEXT
DOESN'T THAT HAPPEN
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT
AND YOU COULD JUST FEEL THE TENSION
AND I REMEMBER JUST ASKING HIM A QUESTION
AND THEN WALK TO THE PLACE I'M GOING
SOME GROUPS OF FRIENDS
READ THIS THIS IS THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE CONTRACT
JUST FILL IT UP WITH WATER
WOULD YOU LIKE TO WORK WITH SELMA
THE BREATHING AND THE WARMTH OF YOUR BODY
THAT MOTION OF THE BODY
IF WE DO HAVE THAT AS OUR AIM
AND WHAT A SPOT FOR IT
ENJOYING THE NOVEL EXPERIENCE OF TRAVELLING MORE THAN FIFTY MILES PER HOUR
WE COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON WITH THIS
YOU WOULD EXPECT THE PAINTING OF THIS PIECE TO HAVE TAKEN APPROXIMATELY TWENTY OR
UM I THINK IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
IT'S IT'S A FUNNY THING WITH THE WORLD OF JEWELLERY
THE RARITY AND THE CONDITION
I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME
BUT WE NORMALLY ENDED UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY WANTED
THEY VERY OFTEN DIDN'T HAVE MUCH INCENTIVE TO CHANGE
AND I THINK THAT KOMAROV WAS NO EXCEPTION
IT'S A PRETTY PICTURE THOUGH
I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD AND
AND THEY WERE ROUGH CONTEMPORARIES
IT'S GOT A VALUE
IN WINDSOR CASTLE
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO MARK THINGS
COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S SHOW
IT DOES LIMIT YOU AS WELL
HOW MUCH AN ACRE IS IT
MY NAME IS JIM CAMPBELL
PICK UP THE SAME STUFF
THE BRANDING ON IT IS GREAT BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS
POSSIBLY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE
BUT OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEURS
THEY'RE DOING THINGS THE OTHER WAY AROUND
THEY HAVE SOME SALES IN THE US WITH THEIR INNOVATIVE COMBINATION OF GREETING CARD AND VASE
IT WOULD BE IN THE FLOOR SECTION OF A SUPERMARKETS AND IN JUNE OF LAST YEAR
I'M VERY CONFUSED ABOUT WHY THAT IS A PRESENTATIONALLY GREAT GIFT
SO OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS
IF IT SOLVES A PROBLEM AND YOU SELL A LOT
YOU CAN MAKE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND THAT'S WHAT OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEUR HOPES
HE'S EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD JORDAN DAYKIN
THAT'S THE FIRST THING THEY DO IS GO THERE
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHAT PRODUCTS PEOPLE USE
SO I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT
IN THE IN THE CARAVAN INDUSTRY
WELL DONE TO HIM
WOULD YOU INVEST IN HIS OR ANY OF THE OTHER BUSINESSES IN THE DEN TONIGHT
A TRAIN IN SPAIN
EVERY TIME I COME HERE
AND MADRID IS AT THE VERY CENTRE
SPAIN HAD LOST ITS LAST ATLANTIC COLONIES TO THE UNITED STATES AS PART OF THE SPANISH AMERICAN WAR
OR THE DISASTER
SO WHILE THE BRITISH EMPIRE WAS GROWING
RAILWAY SPEED IS SLOW
YOU COULD SAY THAT I'M IN THIRD
THE LAST COLLAPSE BEING ON AUGUST FIRST
SOME SOCIAL STANDING
THE NATIONAL RAILWAY COMPANY
FURNISHED BY MAPLES
BUT WE CANNOT SAY THAT
IT'S BECAUSE OF WORLD WAR ONE
IN BRITAIN WE'RE VERY WELL AWARE THAT WE HAVE TRAINS
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY REVOLUTIONARY
WHOSE REBELLION IN SICILY AND INTREPID MARCH INTO THE PENINSULA FREED VAST TRACTS OF ITALY
AND MADE HIM A CULT FIGURE
APPARENTLY THE REGION WAS COVERED IN MULBERRY TREES
IT'S THIRTY TWO MILES LONG
TWO TO THREE MILES IN WIDTH
THEY FALL IN LOVE BECAUSE
AND I WON'T BE THE FIRST BRITISH TRAVELLER
CLUTCHING A BRADSHAW'S GUIDE
WHERE JULIET'S PARENTS ARE SAID TO HAVE LIVED
OVER THE CENTURIES SINCE SHAKESPEARE WROTE HIS PLAY ABOUT THE STAR CROSSS LOVERS
JULIET AND HER ROMEO
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MOVED BY THEIR STORY
TOURISTS EXPECTED A BALCONY
SO VERONA GAVE THEM ONE
I SUGGEST YOU THESE
EXTRAORDINARY TO THINK THAT FOR A DECADE
MEETING WITH SOME FRIENDS AT THE CAFE FLORIAN
THE BUCK STOPS WITH YOU
WITHOUT THE CONFIDENCE
ANIMALS ALL THE TIME AND NOT ALL OF THEM ARE GOOD OUTCOMES
PEOPLE CAN GET QUITEQUEASY ABOUT THAT
MUSIC AND GOOD SOCIETY
I THINK FOR HIS UNDERSTANDING OF HUMANITY
UM MANY PEOPLE DON'T LIKE BARGA
AND BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A HARD JOB
WITH AN ORCHESTRA OF A HUNDRED AND A CHOIR OF ONE
I WONDERED WHAT AN ELECTRIC CAR MIGHT BE
IT'S THE SEAT OF THE SUPREME LAW COURTS OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE AND ITS UNIVERSITY IS ANCIENT AND
AND IT'S STILL THOUGHT TO BE THE BIGGEST OUR CONTINENT BY FLOOR AREA
AND NOW SINCE THE FALL OF COMMUNISM
SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT
UNDER THE EL IS A DOUBLE TUNNEL FOR PEDESTRIANS AND VEHICLES
MADE AT A COST OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
IT'S FIVE YEARS OF ANAL GLANDS
WHEN YOU GET A PATIENT IN WHICH IS DISORIENTED
AND NOT NECESSARILY WHAT SHE WAS INTELLECTUALLY BEST AT
THEY'RE ALL HAPPY
AND IT WAS KICKED BY A HORSE
HOLD YOUR ARMS INSIDE THE CARRIAGE
AND THE TRAIN WAS SEALED IN THE SENSE THAT
AND IN THE WINDOW
TO PUT IT MILDLY
PRETTY RELAXED ABOUT NUDITY
THE ROMANESQUE CATHEDRAL
MY BRADSHAW SAYS
AND IT SUGGESTS THAT I MAKE A VISIT TO THE SKIING COMPETITION OF HOLMEN COLUMN
THERE THE FUTURE
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S TAKEN THEM THIS LONG TO INVITE ME BACK
I DON'T WANT YOU MESSING IT UP BY PLAYING WITH HEAVY MACHINERY
I MANAGED TO GET MY OWN PARKING SPACE JUST BY PRETENDING TO HAVE GOUT
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE DIABETES
WHY DON'T YOU JUST BUY YOUR OWN JAFFA CAKES
IT'S LIKE HAVING ONE OF THOSE HELPER MONKEYS THAT QUADRIPLEGICS GET
I'VE TAKEN HER UNDER MY WING
FOR LUNCH TODAY
SO INSTEAD OF A CHICKEN BURRITO
IF YOU TOUCH ME
THEY GOT JUMPED BY TOM FLACK
NO OFFENCE BUT YOUR LIFE'S KIND OF
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
BECAUSE THESE WATERS ARE GOING TO GET SERIOUSLY CHOPPY
BUT THAT GIRL HAS GOT A DARK SIDE
I ASKED HER TO STAY LATE
BUT I JUST THINK THE TWO OF US NEED TO GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS
HE'S HEAD OF OUR ANTIULYING SCHEME
MAYBE A CRIMINAL RECORD
I'LL DROP ALL THE CHARGES IF YOU PROMISE TO TURN DOWN THE SUMMER PLACEMENT AT MY OFFICE
AND GET ME A BURRITO ONCE A WEEK
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO HANG OUT WITH THEM ANYMORE
GERMAN IS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD
THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY REMINDS ME THAT IT CAME TO MEAN ONE WHO LEADS A VAGABOND OR
AN OLD SYNAGOGUE DATING FROM THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT
AS THE DAY DRAW WERE CLOSE
WHICH BRADSHAW TELLS ME
NEAR THE BOHEMIAN FRONTIER
BEFORE WORLD WAR I
AFTER WORLD WAR TWO
TELLS US SOMETHING ABOUT
BUT AN ALLEYWAY LIKE THIS GIVES US A HINT OF THE CHARM THAT WAS
BECAUSE THIS WAS
IT'S NEO GOTHIC
I CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH AND UNTIL CHALLENGED
THAT THAT COULD BE CANCEROUS
WITH AN ABSCES
AND ONCE IT'S GONE
YOU CAN'T GET IT BACK BUT IT'S STILL FLOATING AROUND IN THERE
IF I'VE BEEN TO THE GAME
WELCOME TO MATCH OF THE DAY
THEY'LL NEVER CHANGE THAT MUSIC
WE HOPE YOU LIKE THE NEW MUSIC
DON'T CHANGE THAT
NOW TO REVEAL THE SUBJECT THAT'S PROVOKED A LOT OF GENTLEMEN AND EVEN MORE LADIES TO WRITE PLEADING
TWELVE YEAR OLD RUSSELL
BUT THAT MADE IT EVEN BETTER
I DON'T MIND IT TOO MUCH
FROM A BIG TEAM
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PLEASE ALL THE FANS
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION AND WE HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT
JOINING ME TONIGHT
THREE PLAYERS HAVE DEPARTED
THE TRICK IS ALWAYS BUY WHEN YOU'RE STRONG
AS IT TURNED OUT
AN INDUSTRY
IT WAS A PROPER
A NEW INSIGHT INTO A PLAYER'S POINT OF VIEW
IT WAS VERY EXCITING
WHERE WERE WE BEFORE WE WERE SO RUDELY INTERRUPTED
BECAUSE WE'VE ALL SAT THERE EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT ON THE SOFA AS THE PERSON ABOUT TO ENJOY THAT
AND THERE I WAS
SO IT WAS JUST MASSIVE
MASSIVE RESPONSIBILITY AS OPPOSED TO PRIDE
YOU'VE GOT TO CREATE MAGIC
AND I CAN HEAR EVERY ONE OF THEIR VOICES NOW
WHO WERE ALL AT THE BBC
I WAS WORKING WITH DAVID COLEMAN
HE KNEW EVERYTHING
I'VE SAT NEXT TO HIM WHEN HE'S DOING IT
AND RETAIN THAT KNOWLEDGE
IT'S IT'S BECOME A REAL TRADE NOW
BALOTELLI HAD THE BALL
A LOT OF THE BIG GAMES BEING SHIFTED TO SUNDAY
SO IT NEEDS A DIFFERENT SHOW
A VERY WARM WELCOME TO YOU TO A VERY NEW SHOW
THE MORE CONSERVATIVE
WE COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT
THEN YOU'LL HAVE MATCH OF THE DAY
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO STAND HERE ALL DAY LISTENING TO YOU
YEAHS VERY SIMILAR
THE SHOCKING THING
HOTTER REGIONS WILL FIND IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO GROW GRAPES
TO FEEDING THE SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE ON OUR PLANET
BUT AS KATE'S BEEN FINDING OUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO CREATE INTERESTING PAIRINGS AND THEY DON'T
BUT WE ALL DO AND I DO ALL THE TIME
MATCHING UNUSUAL FLAVOURS TO GREAT EFFECT ISN'T AS CUTTING EDGE AS IT SOUNDS
CLEVER COOKING IS ABOUT REINVENTING DISHES TO KEEP FOOD EXCITING
WHETHER YOU'RE EXPERIMENTING IN THE KITCHEN
BECAUSE THEY ARE PROTECTED BY THEIR MOTHER'S POUCH
HIS MUM'S WITH HIM TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY
BUT I HAVE TO DO OTHER THINGS
I WOULD HAVE DONE
IT DOESN'T LOOK AS LIKE
HE MEANS BUSINESS
THERE ARE A LOT OF MARKETS HERE AND I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUR QUESTIONS
THAT WOULD BE AN ARAULIC SYSTEM AGAIN
IT'LL HAVE TO BE FOR IT BEING MARBLE
THAT'S REALLY WHERE YOU NEED TO HIT THE MARKET
BUT THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT MARKET
WE GET LOTS OF APPLICATIONS FROM ENTREPRENEURS WITH PRODUCTS FOR CHILDREN AND THEY'RE USUALLY
LET'S SEE IF THE DRAGONS THINK THEY'RE WORTHY OF INVESTMENT
THOUSAND POUNDS FOR A TEN PERCENT STAKE IN MY COMPANY
LIKE A POP UP TENT
LAST YEAR FOR CHRISTMAS
THEY ALWAYS LOVED MAKE BELIEVE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THAT'S WHERE I'D LIKE TO USE THE INVESTMENT
TO GET TO THAT POINT
THERE'S A SENSE OF RECOVERY IN THE ECONOMY AND IT'S BEEN A BUOYANT SEASON IN THE DEN
ONE IN WHICH WE'VE SEEN THE INNOVATIVE
THE INGENIOUS AND SOMETIMES THE IMPLAUSIBLE
BRINGS THE WHOLE THING ALIVE AND PEOPLE
IT'S THE STORY OF THREE BROTHERS WHO RUN AWAY TO LIVE IN THE WOODS ALONE
SO THE STORY GOES THAT ON A BRIGHT SUMMER'S EVENING WHEN BB WAS ABOUT FOUR YEARS OLD
THEY WANT PEOPLE LIKE THE CARRINGTONS TO GET OUTSIDE MORE WITH THEIR FAMILIES
A FEW LONG HOT SUMMERS AGO
WHETHER THAT'S IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD
THIS IS THEIR FIRST TIME AWAY FROM HOME AND IT CAN BE TOUGH AND THEY DO GET HOMESICK AND WE
FRIENDS FOR LIFE
BUT I'D ALWAYS JUST WORK IN BARS AND STUFF
THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH
ONE OF THE ADMISSIONS OFFICERS WAS REALLY IMPRESSED
AS WELL AS SURPRISE
THAT AT THIS AGE I'VE GOT SO MUCH EXPERIENCE
ACTUALLY BEING OUT HERE
WHAT WE DID WAS
LIKE MANY OF THE ANIMALS ON THE SHETLANDS
SO WE'VE GOT A NATIONAL INITIATIVE CALLED FAMILY FISHING WHERE PEOPLE CAN TURN UP TO BIG EVENTS AND
THAT'S ONE GREAT FIRST STEP
I WANTED THAT TO BE MY REAL WORLD
THAT IS HOW I DISCOVERED THE PURPLE EMPEROR BUTTERFLY
INVESTIGATING ONE OF THE MOST MYSTERIOUS PLACES IN THE UK
HE SAYS THE APPEAL IS NEARLY ALL SCENIC
OR IF THEY WERE VERY POOR
BUT IT DOES COME WITH A WARNING
BECAUSE LOOK AT THOSE HILLS
BUT NOT EASY TO RIDE UP
DESPITE ITS MANY ATTRACTIONS
AND THAT WOULD HAVE APPEALED TO HIM
ALBEIT FOR FOR QUITE A SHORT TIME
WHICH FOR SOMEONE LIKE HIM
THIS IS A BOOK ABOUT TWO WELSH HILL FARMERS WHO NEVER WENT OUT
BUT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
ABOUT WELSH BORDER LIFE
THEY WERE ALWAYS GIVEN A PINT OF BEER EVERY DAY
AND AT THAT TIME I BECAME INVOLVED WITH THE BRITISH EAGLE CYCLE FACTORY
AND GETTING TOWARDS THE END
IT'S MUCH HAPPIER WHEN IT'S FLAT AND FAST
BUT BUILT INTO A RACING DESIGNED BICYCLE
AND LARGELY BRITISH HOLIDAY MAKERS
AND YET IT'S SO DIFFERENT
ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT
AND THERE ALWAYS WAS
I WAS CYCLING ALONG THAT VERY LONG
THE REAL LAST INVASION ACTUALLY CAME HERE IN FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THE STORY OF THE MARY ROSE
THEN OBVIOUSLY HE WOULD THEN HAVE TO COME IN AND AND WRITE IT DOWN
WHICH IS WHY THERE IS THIS SENSE OF AN AUDIENCE LEARNING SOMETHING
AT LEAST IN PART
BECAUSE WHEN HE SAYS
SOME OF THE BLACK AND WHITE FIFTY S WAR MOVIES
REALLY CLOSE TO MY HEART THE GREAT BRITISH WAR MOVIE
MAN WITH NO NAME
HOW THE THE BRITISH
WE SAW NOT EVEN TWO DECADES EARLIER THE STIFF UPPER LIP ON DISPLAY
MY GRANDAD JUST WENT BACK AND FORWARD ACROSS THE ATLANTIC
WITH THAT LOW LEVEL TERROR THE WHOLE TIME BUT
INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN WIN IT IN A DAY
MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THEIR OWN
SO I THINK ACTUALLY
THE BRITISH PUBLIC WERE
ARE YOU ENTERTAINED BY WAR FILMS
WE WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT OUR WHAT OUR FATHERS DID IN THE WAR
THEIR MOST HEROIC
IT'S A MESSAGE ABOUT STIFF UPPER LIP
HOW WE WON THE WAR
SO WE GET TO SEE
IT'S MULTIETHNIC
WHY WOULDN'T YOU AND
AND THAT SEXUAL MOREAGE LOOSENED UP FANTASTICALLY DURING THE WAR
IT'S ONE THAT RESONATES WITH US AND BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN ON TV SO MUCH
VERY STRAIGHT BACKED
AND I THINK IT'S JUST WHAT YOU DO WITH CINEMATIC BADDIES
AND IN FILMS MADE DURING THE WAR AS WELL
AND I THINK SOMEHOW
THERE TO THE YOUNG COMMANDO WHO WHO CAN'T KILL A MAN
THAT'S VERY LOOSELY BASED ON WHAT
ALTHOUGH NOT ENOUGH NOT TO GET HIM OUT OF A BOX WHERE HE'S BEEN BEING COOKED TO DEATH ESSENTIALLY
LOTS OF THE ELITE WERE SENDING THEIR KIDS OFF TO NORTH AMERICA TO AVOID THE WAR
AND WE KNOW YOU'VE GOT BOMB SHELTERS DOWN THERE
AND SO THERE WAS HUGE TENSION GOING
YOU NEED TO BE BENEVOLENT
YOU NEED TO PLAY YOUR PART AS WELL
LACKING SUBSTANTIAL EQUIPMENT
THEY' A BAD GUY
THE TOINS READY
TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT THIS PICTURE WAS ABOUT AND WHY THEY SHOULD UM INVEST IN IT
SHOWING THE RUSSIANS
PEOPLE LIKE FROST
GENE HACKMAN'S FIRST LINE IS
THIS IS HISTORY
THAT SEEMS TO BE PART OF THE MESSAGE OF THAT FILM
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S ALL GONE JOLLY WELL AND WE NEED TO WE NEED TO KEEP THAT SPIRIT GOING INTO AND INTO REBUILDING
YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE THICK OF OF THE WAR AND AND
NOEL COWARD OF ALL PEOPLE
AREN'T GOING TO GO TO SAVING PRIVATE
THAT IS A WATERSHED MOMENT AND I THINK WAR FILMS
AND THAT'S STILL HAPPENING NOW
MORE BRITISH SHIPS WERE FOUGHT AT D DAY THAN AMERICANS BUT
NEITHER OF THEM FEEL PARTICULARLY HEROIC AFTER IT AND AND THAT'S VERY
AND ALL OF THE BITS THAT I'D FORGOTTEN CAME RUSSIA
UM YOU KNOW THESE THINGS ARE ALL MUSHED UP TOGETHER
WHAT'S SO BRILLIANT ABOUT THIS IS IT RAISES THAT IDEA OF SHAME
AND INDEED ADAPTATIONS
THEY'RE AMONGST US
THEY MIGHT LOOK LIKE US
THEY'RE EXACTLY LIKE US
WHAT IF THEY WERE HERE
WOULD YOU GO TO BERMUDA OR CANADA
THE ROYAL FAMILY SHOULD AND SOME PEOPLE SHOULD
BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE ONE WITH YOU
WHAT ON EARTH IS
AT THE MOMENT THAT THIS FILM IS BEING MADE
PULLING A LOAD OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS INTO INTO IT IS LIKE
GEOFF LOVE COLONEL BOGEY
LAWRENCE OF ARABIA
WE CAN SEE SHE'S BRAVE
EVEN WHEN SHE GETS HIT SHE DOESN'T STOP
IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN THAT GET LEFT OUT OF THESE WAR MOVIES
THESE ARE FILMS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEN
WE DON'T OFTEN SENSE THAT THAT THERE'S ANY KIND OF
ANYTHING HOROTIC IN THE AIR APART FROM WHEN ANGUS LENNY IS AROUND
THERE'S NO SEX EITHER
AND IN SOMETHING LIKE IN WHICH WE SERVE
WHERE THERE ARE MEN AND WOMEN AT THE SAME TIME
THEY EVEN CONSIDER WHEN THEY'RE BILLETING
THE SOLDIERS WHO AT THE TIME THEY BELIEVE TO BE BRITISH AND WENT THE DAY WELL
I THINK I'M PROBABLY GOING TO GO WITH
IT'S VERY UNHEROIC
THEY WOULD ALWAYS TURN UP AT BOXING DAY AND CHRISTMAS AND BANK HOLIDAYS
WHETHER IT'S THE STIFF UPPER LIP FILMS OR WHERE EAGLES DARE
I MEAN I'M WORRIED
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE AUDITIONING FOR THE X FACTOR JUST CRY AT EVERYTHING
HE CALLS THIS SOME OF THE BESTCYCLING IN BRITAIN
THE ATTRACTION HAD LITTLE TO DO WITH LITERATURE
VERY BICYCLE FRIENDLY
SHE TOOK ON AN APPRENTICESHIP AT THIS SHOP HERE WHEN IT WAS A PHOTOGRAPHER'S STUDIO
SHE WOULD END UP RUNNING THE WHOLE BUSINESS
THE TWO WOMEN FELT THAT
AND EVEN HAROLD RECOGNISED HOW FAR THEIR FAME HAD SPREAD
THEY WEREN'T JUST LOCAL HEROINES
THEY WERE GLOBAL
ALL HAD BIG NOVELS PUBLISHED
EMILY HAD WUTHERING HEIGHTS
AND ANNE HAD AGNES GREY
FACTORIES WERE BEING BUILT
AND ALL OF THEM
BUT ONE KEY FEATURE STILL REMAINS
SHE PLAYED CARDS WITH THE MEN AS WELL
THE RESERVOIRS WERE OFFICIALLY OPENED AND THE NAVVIES HAD MOVED ON TO FIND WORK ELSEWHERE SO DAWSON
BECAUSE THEY WERE
IT WASN'T LIKE BEING A MASON
AND NEW MEMBERS ARE SUBJECTED TO SEARCHING QUESTIONS AND MEDICAL INSPECTION
THOSE BIG CLIMBS REWARDED WITH INCREDIBLE VIEWS RIGHT ACROSS THE MOORLAND
BUT YOU CAN'T MOVE
SHE'S VERY NOT FAR AWAY FROM SITTING HER FINALS AND BEING LET OUT INTO THE BIG WIDE WORLD
WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS
IF IT'S POSITIVE
AND AS SOON AS YOU HEAR THAT WORD
HAVE A LOOK INSIDE
HAVING BEEN THROUGH THOSE TWO WEEKS
IS SPECIAL BECAUSE IT'S GOT ABERNETI BUTTER IN IT
HE'S LET ME DOWN
HE'S DONE WRONG AGAIN
BUT YOU'VE GOT A JOB
WHEN YOU SAY SUMMER
ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
HE WAS FAMOUS FOR THE PHRASE
I AM YOUR FATHER
DIE HARD AMERICAN FANS
I'M GOING TO SHOOT YOU WITH MY
HAVE A LOOK AT WHY A SHOP UP NORTH HAS HAD TO STOP SELLING PEANUT
A STORY ABOUT NUT ALLERGIES HAS GOT NOTHING ON THIS
SHE'S IN THE GARDEN COVERED IN BREAD
THIS TREATMENT ISN'T FOR EVERYONE
GOD BLESS THE SUN NEWSPAPER
THEY WERE ASKING THINGS LIKE
SHOULD WE INTERVENE IN SYRIA
I HATE THIS STORY SO MUCH BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
THE TRAGIC EVENTS IN BOSTON LAST MONTH WRECKED LIVES
IT'S GOT A VERY POWERFUL BITE
WHAT MAY SURPRISE YOU IS THAT ALICE AND ALL THE OTHER BIZARRE CHARACTERS WERE BORN RIGHT HERE IN
SO I'M PLEASED IT'S BEEN IN THE BROOM CUPBOARD AND THAT'S QUITE NICE
WE WILL PUT A RESERVE ON THEM
WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT ONE
FROM THE CELEBRATED COLLECTION OF THE ARTIST SIR THOMAS LAWRENCE
OTHERWISE THERE'S TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
ABOUT HIS LOVE AND PASSION FOR DRAWING
AND YOU CAN SIT AS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC DOES
THE FOR POSTERITY
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
YEAH BUT THAT IS THE VALUE
YOU WERE SPOT ON
SORRY IT DIDN'T FLY
IT'S MY TURN TO BE THE EXPERT
REMEMBER THAT LOVELY VICTORIAN DESK STAND INK WELL
YOU HAD YOUR WIFE WITH YOU
NOT JUST BECAUSE I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT MUSIC
SOMETHING QUITE RARE
YOU GET TO PLAY THE THINGS AS WELL
WHAT A DATE IN HISTORY
IF THERE'S TWO PEOPLE IN THE SALEROOM THAT ARE GOING TO BUY THEIR OWN RESTORATION WORK
SOMEBODY HAD DIED IN THE ESTATE
TAKE ADVICE FROM THE PROFESSIONALS
WE WOULD LOVE TO SELL THAT FOR YOU
YOU CAN CHECK THE DETAILS ON OUR BBC WEBSITE
FOLLOW THE LINKS
IT'S SO EASY TO FORGET SHE'S ALREADY BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH
I'M VERY RELIEVED
AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY
IF WE COULD JUST DO THAT
HE TALKS ABOUT HOW
IF WE DON'T PROTECT THE WILD PLACES OF AFRICA
HARRY BA IS TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
AND TO BE AT A GREAT COUNTRY HE LIKE CHATSWORTH
WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS YOU'VE GOT MAPLE SYRUP AND YOU'VE GOT WALNUTS
THEY'RE NOT DRY NOW
WE'VE WE'VE BEEN CHECKING THE WEATHER DAILY
I WOULD KISS YOU
IT'S LIKELY WHEN WE GO TO THE AUCTION
WE REALLY DO HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT SO LET'S GET ON WITH IT
TO THE INDUSTRIOUS MONKS
AND IT'S BEEN MADE HERE EVER SINCE
AND BEFORE I GO OFF TO THE CREAMERY TO FIND OUT HOW CHEESE IS ACTUALLY MADE
THAT IS JUST A FULL SCALE
THIS IS QUITE SIMPLE
AND THAT WILL KILL OFF ANY BAD BACTERIA
IT'S NOT THAT HARD WORK
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE GOT DOWN TO BUSINESS
COURT SELL THE HOUSE
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY
THE WHOLE PLACE THEN WOULDN'T CATCH ON FIRE
THE THEATRE AND THE BUTLER COMPANY PARTED WAYS
DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR
IT WAS A STORAGE DEPOT
IT'S THE OLDEST AND THE MOST COMPLETE GEORGIAN PLAYHOUSE IN BRITAIN AND THAT'S A FACT
IT'S THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE
IT'S STILL PRETTY MUCH A FULL HOUSE
THAT'S WHEN THIS FIGURE WAS MADE
BELONGS TO ANDREW
WE STILL SEE A LOT OF THEM
BUT WE'VE GOT THAT WONDERFUL BRONZE
IT'S IT'S MADE THE IT'S MADE ALL THE TRADE PRESS
JOIN US AGAIN SOON FOR MANY MORE
TO TRY AND PROVE THEIR POINT
TOLD US TO BUY A REAR WHEEL DRIVE CAR WITH IT
AND THEN GO TO CALAIS
AND THAT IF YOU'RE AT ALL SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR DRIVING
FIFTEEN HUNDRED PAN REAR WHEEL DRIVE CARS TO A RACETRACK
REAR WHEEL DRIVE HAS NOT BEEN RELEVANT IN ANY WAY
AND BOTH DAUGHTERS
ENJOY THE VIEW WITH A NICE WINE
WE'LL PUT SOME MATHS INTO THE MIX
BECAUSE WE'LL FIND OUT HOW FAST IT GOES ROUND OUR TRACK
I'VE LOST MY WALLET
AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW
ALAN TITCHMARSH MIGHT SAY SO
WHAT DOES HE KNOW
ON THIS OCCASION
DESTROYED ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE CARS
AND A DEAD FIT ONE
WHICH IS A GOOD THING
BECAUSE WE'RE BOUND TO BREAK IT
I'D CRASHED INTO A PIANO
AND WE WERE NOW ON OUR WAY TO A SKI RESORT IN THE ALPS
A MORRIS MARINA
AGAINST A TARGET OF SIXTEEN
IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT GETTING HERE
DON'T GET ME THREE TYPES OF OLIVES
AND IS WILLING TO PAY ANYTHING FOR IT
I THINK THEN FOR US AS WELL
HAVE ABOUT FIVE
ALWAYS GET GUESTS THAT SAY
WE'VE SEEN THESE FORMATS
THAT I REMEMBER SEEING THAT FORMAT AND I LIKE IT AND PLEASE USE IT
EVEN THAT TINY AS I WAS
ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT
I KNOW FULL WELL IF I STEP OUTSIDE THE DOOR HERE
THAT KIND OF THING IN LONDON WOULD BE THIS THING
SO STARTING FROM THE COCKTAILS
SO THESE PEOPLE
BUT WHAT ALSO MY FAMILY WANTS OUT OF MY WIFE
HE SORT IN MY BOARDING PASS FOR TOMORROW
BUT THAT'S NORMAL IN THESE HOTELS
BUT IT MAKES ME GO
FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
IT'S AS MUCH ASPIRATION FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO COME AND WORK IN HERE AS MUCH AS IT IS FOR A GUEST TO COME IN
WHAT STARTED HAPPENING IS THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS
IF YOU ASK ME MY VIEW
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T ACCIDENTALLY WRONG THE WORDS SAY
AUNTS AND GRANNIES
THAT ONCE I'D GOT OVER THE SLIGHT KIND OF
SHE FELL ASLEEP WHEN SHE CAME ON THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW WHILE AN EXPERT WAS VALUING HER EGG
FRIDAY NIGHT TRADITION
WE CAN GET FISHING CHIPS
I THINK THIS WOMAN JUST DIED
I WOKE UP THE NEXT DAY AND FELT VERY HUNG OVER
UM THREE WEEKS IN ADVANCE
I FOUND OUT WHO I WAS WITH
MY NAME IS LAURA
WAS SHE OPEN ABOUT FALLING ASLEEP OR DID SHE WAKE UP AND DO THAT THING WHERE
THIS IS THE SET OF KEYS I CARRY AROUND WITH ME EVERY DAY
I KNOW WHAT EVERY SINGLE ONE IS FOR
WHERE AM I AND WILL TODAY'S BUYERS BE PUTTING THEIR MONEY WHERE THEIR MOUTH IS
IT WAS BUILT IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
IT'S THE ANCESTRAL HOME OF THE HORE BANKING DYNASTY
IT WAS RICHARD HORE WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF USING PAPER INSTEAD OF GOLD FOR FINANCIAL
PAVING THE WAY FOR THE MONEY THAT WE USE TODAY
BUT WITH PROPERTY PRICES HERE SO HIGH
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SERIOUSLY STUMPING UP FOR THAT PRIVILEGE
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO LOOK ELSEWHERE
SO WE WANT TO MOVE ON
FIND SOMETHING BIGGER
THEN PROPERTY IS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT CHEAPER
WHEREVER YOU LOOK AROUND THIS COUNTY THERE'S A WEALTH OF PROPERTY ON OFFER
WE WOULD WANT AT LEAST A DOUBLE GARAGE
MAYBE JOIN A LOCAL GARDENING CLUB
SO THAT I CAN ACTUALLY INTEGRATE WITH THE LOCALS AND GET TO KNOW PEOPLE
AND WHICH IS ASTRONOMY
A WISH LIST THAT HASN'T CHANGED NOW THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
PARKING FOR THREE CARS
WE'RE NOT COMPARING THE SAME THINGS
TEN BY FOUR FOOT TABLE IN A ROOM
WE NEED GARAGES
AND TO GET DOWN THE CANAL
BUT WILTSHIRE HAS A LANDED ESTATE WITH A DIFFERENCE
ONE BUILT UP BY A FAMILY WITH HUMBLE ORIGINS WHOSE FORTUNE WAS MADE ON THE MEAN STREETS OF LONDON'S
AND OUR SEARCH CONTINUES TO FIND THE LOVELY CHRIS AND HELEN THEIR DREAM PROPERTY HERE IN WILTSHIRE
IT WENT RATHER WELL YESTERDAY
WHAT I'M HOPING IS
ARE ALL SINGING FROM THE SAME SPREADSHEET
WE'VE GOT SEVEN HUNDRED ACRES HERE
WE CERTAINLY ARE
AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU ROLL A WHEEL IN AT A TIME
AND IT'S QUITE NICE
WILL THAT ONE ASPECT SWING IT FOR THEM
I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT HELEN WASN'T TOO KEEN ON THE FACT THAT IT WAS A BUNGALOW TO START WITH
MAYBE IT'S A CASE OF BUNGALY YES
IF ANY OF THE HOUSES
WILL HELEN AND CHRIS GO FOR
THIS IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT ONE TO CALL
BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD REALLY POSITIVE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT ALL THE PROPERTIES
BUT HAVE WE FOUND THEM THE RIGHT HOUSE
WITH THE RIGHT GARDEN
AND WE NEVER WANTED CHILDREN
BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE PAST THE BRICKS AND WATER
AND YOU KNOW GOOD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE
AND I'D SAY MADEIRA'S LOSS IS VERY MUCH WILTSHIRE THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTY'S
TOLD US TO PRETEND WE WERE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS AND THEN GO OUT THERE AND BUY CARS THAT WOULD PLEASE US AS
PARENTS WILL LOVE IT FOR THIS REASON
WHICH IS IMPORTANT
THE OTHER IS A TOTALITARIAN REGIME
THAT IS THE BEST NOISE IN THE WORLD
AH YOU'LL BE IN THE SHOWERS AND A BIG
AND YOU HAVE A CRASH
WHAT I HEARD WAS
STARTED OUT IN LIFE
WITH A LAURIE SO
THE ONLY THING WE CAN BE SURE HE HASN'T DONE
HIS FATHER WORKED IN FORD
AND WHEN HE WENT TO COLLEGE TO DO AUTOMOTIVE DESIGN AND HE TOLD HIS FATHER HE WAS HE'D GOT A JOB
WHEN YOU LOAD IT
THREE HOURS AFTERWARD SAID WE'D BE IN
WITHOUT WAKING THEM UP
THE WINNER WOULD BE THE ONE WHO COULD DO IT THE MOST QUIETLY
INSURED AND CUSTOMISED THREE CARS THAT WE FEEL ARE IDEAL FOR SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS AND THEIR PARENTS
EARLIER ON IN THE SHOW
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SAYING THEN WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THE BEST
WE'VE GOT THE BEACH
EVERYBODY IS THOROUGHLY ENJOYING THEMSELVES
IT'S JAM PACKED BACK THERE IN THE PAVILION
NOT JUST TO GET SOME FRESH AIR
I'M PERFECTLY HONEST WITH THAT'S ABOUT ALL I COULD DO AS WELL
BUT TELL ME ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL MANDOLIN
THESE INSTRUMENTS WERE FIRST SORT OF MADE IN THIS KIND OF FORM AND SHAPE IN THE EARLY PART OF THE SEVENTEENTH
CAN YOU SEE THAT
BUT DURING THAT PERIOD
SHE NEVER STOPPED WRITING NOVELS
AND TOGETHER WITH HER HUSBAND LEONARD
AND SHE FOUNDED THE HOGARTH PRESS
WAS HOME TO ONE OF THE GREATEST WRITERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
IT'S MONK'S HOUSE
THAT WHOLE DECADE
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO SILVER
SEE WHAT HE'S GOT TO SAY
THE PHOTOJOURNALIST LEE MILLER
AND ALSO ICONIC NAMES LIKE SALVADOR DALI
WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLY BOLD MOVE
HOME TO THE ENGLISH SURREALISTS
IT'S TIME FOR ACT TWO
BRING THEM ALONG TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE
I'VE BEEN JOINED BY JANET AND WE'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT WILL APPEAL TO THE MACABRE
SOMEBODY WITH A WONDERFUL
THE HOUSE IS FILLING UP
SOMETHING FOR ALL YOU TAXIDERMY ENTHUSIASTS
IT BELONGS TO JO
I'VE GOT TO SAY
IT'S A ROLLER COASTER RIDE JUST ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE
IT'S GOING UNDER THE HAMMER
I DID HAVE MY DOUBTS
I KNOW IT WAS A BIT OF A STRUGGLE
THE HUMBLE SHEPHERD'S HUT IS BEING RESCUED
IT'S NOT JUST FRUSTRATING
IT'S BAD FOR BUSINESS AND
IN EXTREME CASES
PUTS LIVES AT RISK
BUT THE QUESTION IS
WILL WE EVER GET FULL COVERAGE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
THAT I'M GOING TO BE THERE
COVERAGE IS FAR FROM COMPREHENSIVE
CAN WHIP A HILLSIDE FULL OF SHEEP INTO SHAPE IN
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK TO TRY AND UTILISE THAT BETTER
BACK AND BACK IN THOSE DAYS
BUT NOW THEY NOW THEY DO
AND THOSE PEOPLE
IF YOU'RE ON HOLIDAY
THEN THE LACK OF MOBILE SIGNAL CAN BE PART OF RELAXING IN BEAUTIFUL
BUT PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK HERE POINT OUT THAT IT IS THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY
AND THEY NEED TO BE CONNECTED
AS THE OLD JOKE HAS IT
CONVERSATIONS BEGIN AND END WITH
THEY WERE VERY UPSET AND
WHEN THEY'RE CLOSE UP
JANE IS A VERY HARDY WOMAN BUT EVEN SHE NEEDS TO COME PREPARED FOR THE WEATHER
AND THAT'S THE FARMERS WHO WORK THIS LAND
AND WHATEVER ELSE
MOVING AROUND YOU
AND THE RUSTLING OF THE PARACHUTE AND HIS NOISE
HE USED TO COME HERE WITH HIS YOUNGER BROTHER JOHN
SOMEONE WHO LIVED THROUGH HIS EYES
MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
HE TRULY FELT ABLE TO BREATHE
TO HIM IT WAS AS IF HE'D SUDDENLY STEPPED INTO ONE OF THOSE ABSURDIST WORLDS OF THE IMAGINATION
THAT WAS NASH'S SUBJECT
AND DID PAUL NASH ACTUALLY COME HERE
WAS A LITTLE BOY
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MAYBE TWO OR THREE OPERATIONS
AS FAR AS HE'S CONCERNED
THIS IS NUMBER TWO THE PARADE IN SWANAGE
AND I THINK THAT WAS PERHAPS WHAT ATTRACTED HER INITIALLY
IF YOU FALL IN LOVE
JUST LOOK AT HIM
I FIND THINGS GROW WHERE I PAINT THEM
DOWN THERE WITH HIS BINOCULARS
IN PAUL NASH'S PAINTINGS
THEY'RE AMONG THE LAST PAINTINGS HE EVER CREATED

TOP GEAR HAS GONE ALL SPRINGWATCH
BECAUSE IT'S SLOWER
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT READING A BOOK
AND WHEN WE HAD CARS
THERE WOULD BE NOT THE USUAL SERIES OF SMALL CHALLENGES BUT ONE BIG ONE
MOSTLY BY PEOPLE WHO WEAR SLACKS
THE NEARSIDE FRONT TRUNNION TOP AND BOTTOM IS BADLY WORN
WE COULD SIT HERE AND TALK CARS
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
WHICH WAS FABULOUS
IT WAS A FORD POPULAR SIT UP AND BEG
AFTER WE'D BOUGHT THE CARS
AND EVEN NOW IT HAS THAT FEELING OF BEING THE END OF THE LINE

WHAT THEY'RE FED ON
THE PRINCE OF WALES
THERE HAD ALREADY BEEN SEVERAL SCANDALS
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN THE PLACE WHERE THE ROYAL FAMILY WERE SITTING DOWN FOR CHRISTMAS LUNCH
THE MEAT COULD BE THEN TRANSPORTED VERY FRESHLY
I THINK IT'S SEEN A REVIVAL

THAT'S SO THAT'S VERY TRUE
AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF GUNLINS WERE SHIPPED OUT

IT'S IT'S ALL REALLY EASY
WE WANTED TO GET PREGNANT
AND DON'T WRITE ON MY BODY
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE TOUGH
IF YOU GO CAMPING FOR TWO WEEKS AND YOU HAVE TO STAY FOR THREE MONTHS
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE
SHE WANTS THIS TO BE A PLACE FULL OF LIFE
VERY MODERN FOR AN OLD COTTAGE
WE MUSTN'T PICKLE BUILDINGS IN ASPECT
THEY NEED TO MOVE ON
THEY NEED TO CHANGE
BUT OTHER HOUSES HAVE MUCH MORE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS
THEY CAN REALLY MAKE AN ARCHITECTURAL DIFFERENCE WITH THE VERY THINNEST LAYER
I THINK IT WAS SEVENTEEN
I THINK THAT'S GOING SERVE THEM REALLY WELL IN THE YEARS TO COME
DAWN BRAVELY TOOK ON THE HUGE TASK THAT LAY AHEAD
RIPPING APART THE INTERIOR WAS THE FIRST STEP TO CREATING HER DREAM LIVING SPACE
IS IT SOMETHING YOU HAPPY WITH
YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT
WHAT NOT TO SPEND MONEY ON
BUT WITH REAL STYLE
SHE'S KEPT HER EYES ON THE PRIZE
SHE'S REALLY REALLY FOCUSED ON THE THINGS SHE VALUED ABOUT THE SPACE
I COULDN'T REALLY HAVE ASKED FOR BETTER COMMENTS
AS LONG AS I CAN

IT SUPPORTS THEM AS THEY TRY AND BREAK OUT OF THE VICIOUS CYCLE AND TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS TOWARDS GETTING
OR SO THE SAYING GOES
THERE'S MORE MONEY TO BE MADE
IT'S AN INDUSTRY WORTH ONE POINT
WELL TOURISM BRINGS IN WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED BILLION EVERY YEAR
LIKE THEM OR NOT
SECOND HOMES ARE PART OF THAT
GIVEN THEM OTHER JOBS
THERE ARE MANY LOCALS WHO FEEL THE ADVANTAGES BROUGHT BY SECOND HOMES ARE SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE
EVEN IF ONLY FOR PART OF THE YEAR
FOR SOME LOCALS
SECOND HOMES ARE A BONUS
AND IT'S ALL AN OPINION
YOU'VE NOW REACHED A VERY CRITICAL STAGE
IT'S A HUGE FIGURE
YOU KNOW THAT EVERY FORTNIGHT I'VE GOT THAT GUARANTEED MONEY
I CAN PAY MY RENT

IT WAS THE THE GLASGOW UNDERGROUND ACTUALLY
I HAD TO TELL MY NEIGHBOUR THEIR CAT HAD BEEN RUN OVER WHILE MY OWN FACE WAS PAINTED LIKE A KITTEN
SOMETIMES I PUT THE BEANS UNDER THE TOAST
HE EMPLOYS A CHAUFFEUR TO DELIVER HIS PUNCH LINES
WHERE WE BRING ON A MYSTERY GUEST WHO HAS A CLOSE CONNECTION TO ONE OF OUR PANELISTS
THE RECENT WAS BECAUSE YOU ARE
DID THEY DO ANYTHING TO THE TO THE GROOM
YOU'RE AN IDIOT
AND THEN YOU DO A LITTLE BIT OF
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT ME THAT ELEPHANTS LIKE
AS IT MOVED TOWARDS ME
IN THE ARCTIC IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WINTER
BUYING FOR INVESTMENT OR AS A HOME
BUT BUYING AT AUCTION IS SIMPLE
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A POPULAR TOURIST SPOT
SO I DO CONSULTANCY WORK FOR EITHER DEALER GROUPS OR MANUFACTURERS
WE'VE FOUND A FEW SINCE
HOW WILL SHE GET ON
SAY THE RESALE VALUE WOULD BE AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND TEN
BUT A VERY APPEALING PROPERTY THAT I THINK WOULD STILL MAKE A VERY GOOD INVESTMENT
LET'S SEE WHO FANCIED IT WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
PROBABLY WATER DAMAGE
THIS IS JUST A ONE BEDROOM BUNGALOW
AND THEN YOU COULD CREATE THAT SECOND BEDROOM
WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT WITH A HOUSE OF THIS SIZE
WHICH I THINK IS VERY MODEST
THE PROPERTY WOULD BE IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE
FIVE FIFTY PER CALENDAR MONTH
BUT IF YOU WERE TO EXTEND
IT COULD GIVE YOU A BIG RETURN
WHO WANTED THIS
MAYBE SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE POUNDS PER CALENDAR MONTH
SOMETHING PERHAPS A LITTLE CLOSER TO HOME
RATHER THAN A FOUR HOUR DRIVE EACH WAY
AND WHEN YOU LIVE FOUR HOURS AWAY
YOU CAN'T JUST POP IN AND
THE CHIMNEY BREAST
CERTAINLY ISLINGTON SEEMS TO HAVE FARED PRETTY WELL IN THE TOUGH MARKET CONDITIONS WE HAVE HAD OF LATE
AND THERE'S MORE MONEY TO SPEND ON THE REFURBISHMENT
HOW WILL THE VALUATIONS STACK UP ONCE IT'S COMPLETED
MINUS THOSE NINE YEARS
THAT IS REALLY NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT
YOU COULD BE LOOKING AT A RESALE VALUE OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY
I WOULD ESTIMATE AN ASKING PRICE IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
BUT AS MARTIN AND I KNOW
AND THEN ORIGINALLY
WHEN I WAS AT THE AUCTION
I HAD SHORTLISTED THREE PROPERTIES I REALLY WANTED TO BUY
SOME PEOPLE DO DO IT
THREE MONTHS AGO
AND IN THE LAW IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN GOING TO AUCTIONS
PRETTY MUCH LIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSE
IT WOULD RANGE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE
A BATHROOM UPSTAIRS
THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE
I THINK YESER ADMITS THAT HE' HAS TAKEN ON SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HE WAS EXPECTING WITH THIS
WHAT A PROPERTY NOT TO HAVE SEEN BEFOREHAND
SO AT THE MOMENT
BUT IT'S GOT PLANNING PERMISSION FOR TWO PROPERTIES A BUNGALOW AND A HOUSE
AND THE GUIDE PRICE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY
ALL REALLY NICE AND IN KEEPING
ONE HAD THREE HOUSES ON THIS SITE
IT IS SURROUNDED BY OTHER HOUSES
AND WE'RE NOT HAVING THOSE PLANS
NOT MANY OF THEM GET BUILT
SO WE FEEL THAT THERE'LL BE QUITE A FEW DOWNSIZES LOOKING TO BUY ON
SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE SQUARE FEET
WOULD FETCH A VALUE IN THE REGION OF TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE THOUSAND
THE DETACHED HOUSE
WHERE THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL AREA
A LOT OF GARDEN
TELL ME ABOUT THE FAMILY HOUSE
IS THERE GOING TO BE ENOUGH GARDEN
WHAT'S WORRYING YOU ABOUT HAVING BOUGHT THIS
ANYTHING AT ALL
I THINK IF I PUT IT UP FOR THIRTY SEVEN
YOU'LL SEE ME AT THE NEXT PROPERTY AUCTION
I'M IN DU FREE
THE RIVER IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE TOWN'S GREATEST ASSETS
WE'LL EXPLORE THAT IN A MINUTE
I THINK IT WORKS
I DON'T THINK THERE'S THAT MUCH NEED TO DO
THREE BEDROOMS AS WELL
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I WAS EXPECTING
I THINK IT'S A GOOD HOUSE
I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD LITTLE FLAT
JUST LOOK AROUND AND SAY
WE'LL HE WON'T HE
THOUSAND POWER TO SPEND ON THE REFURBISHMENT
A GOOD POTENTIAL INVESTMENT
LET'S SEE WHO AGREED WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TWO OR THREE BEDROOM
I THINK THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REFURBISHMENT GOING ON HERE
MORE LANDSCAPING BY THE RIVER
AH JUST FINDING THE TIME
I WOULD THINK SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF ABOUT SIXTY FIVE
I THINK IT'S PRESENTABLE ENOUGH BUT
BUT IT IS NOT TOP QUALITY
I THINK IF YOU WERE TO RENT THIS PROPERTY OUT
YOU MAY HAVE TO CHANGE TENANTS FROM TIME TO TIME
AND IF THERE ARE
IT WON'T BE FOR LONG
I THINK IT WOULD ACHIEVE BETWEEN FOUR TWENTY FIVE
THERE'S BEEN A COACH CRASH
FROM WORKING ON THE LAND
IF YOU MUST KNOW
IT'S OLIVE FINCHER
AS THE FRIENDS OF AND OLIVE
OR A SPECIALIST EPILEPSY NURSE
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU ARE NEEDED NOW
AH GENERAL SURGERY WARD
ALL OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID
AND THE WHALE SHARP
I THOUGHT WE DID REALLY WELL
STRESS OR NO STRESS
AT ONE FORTY SEVEN AND A HALF
STILL A FEW HOOPS TO JUMP THROUGH
MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE THAN ITS FASHIONABLE NEIGHBOURING
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
THE NEW OWNER WILL HAVE TO OBTAIN PERMISSION BECAUSE THIS PROPERTY IS IN A CONSERVATION AREA
BUT SOME SERIOUS RECONFIGURING NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS IS READY
IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO TAKE IT DOWN
WILL SHE COMPLETE IT ALL IN JUST EIGHT TO TEN WEEKS
SOMEBODY ELSE THOUGHT SO
SO LET'S FIND OUT WHO THAT WAS
CLOSE TO THE TOWN CENTRE CLOSE OPEN COUNTRYSIDE
YOU COULD MAKE IT INTO A FOUR BEDROOMED HOUSE WITH EXTENSIONS
THERE PROPERTY ITSELF HAD A GUIDE PRICE OF SIXTY TWO THOUSAND
I SUPPOSE ON TODAY'S MARKET
EX LOCAL AUTHORITY
TAKE A REALLY NICE PATIO DOOR IN THERE
SO GOING MAKE SURE YOU DON'T OVERSPEND ON THAT EXTENSION
IF YOU'RE LIVING HERE
IT NEEDS A REFIT KITCHEN
BUT AT LEAST IT ISN'T FALLING DOWN
SO THE WALLS ARE OK
WE GOT SOME SPARE CASH
NOW I WAS MADE REDUNDANT LAST YEAR
FRED HAS PICKED HIMSELF UP AND HE AND RACHEL EMBARKING ON A PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT CAREER
THE OWNERS HAVE OBVIOUSLY SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT IN IMPROVING THE PROPERTY AND MAKING IT NICE AND
WE THOUGHT ROUND ABOUT THE ONE TEN
WE BROUGHT IT TO RENT OUT
AND IT HAS AN OPERA HOUSE
SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
SHE'S GOT MORE RIDING ON IT EMOTIONALLY
IF YOU WENT TO A BATHROOM SHOWROOM AND TALKED ABOUT THIS PLACE
HAS GIVEN QUALITIES TO SEVERAL ROOMS ON THE INTERIOR
VERY SMALL TERRACED HOUSE
VERY EASY TO HANDLE
VERY EASY TO FIT
SO WHEN IT'S TOGETHER
IT'S THE EDGES THAT YOU SEE MORE THAN THE FACES
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST BEEN A REVELATION
IN TERMS OF DESIGN
THERE IS THIS TERRIBLE TENDENCY TO WANT TO BREAK THINGS UP
YOU CAN SEE HOW DESIGN HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED THE WAY SHE FEELS ABOUT HER HOME
AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ALL THESE WONDERFUL SIGNS OF AUTUMN
AND AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEASON
WITH ALL OF THE STUFF THAT WE HIKED UP THIS TOWER
WELL I WOULD LIKE TO DEDICATE THIS TO THE FRITWELL C OF E SCHOOL WHO HAVE DONE ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANTLY
THE POWERS THAT BE CLAIMED THE INCORRECT REFERENCES WHICH HAD THE BRITISH AND CHURCHILL HIMSELF
THE PEAKY BLINDERS' TEAM IS NOT THE ONLY ONE BEING SINGLED OUT FOR CRITICISM ON THIS
AND IT IS ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WE WILLLL BE DISCUSSING IN A SPECIAL PROGRAMME NEXT WEEK
BUT IF THE FEEDBACK WE'VE RECEIVED IS ANYTHING TO GO BY
I'M GOING TO LET JUNE AND SHARON EXPLAIN
AWARE THIS HAS BROUGHT COMPLAINTS IN THE PAST
SURELY WE WOULD ALL LOVE MORE CANNON OR BALL ON OUR SCREENS
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SHOW
I DON'T THINK WE HEARD A SINGLE COMPLETE SONG OR HYMN
THE FORMAT DOESN'T ALWAYS STAY THE SAME OF COURSE AND NOR SHOULD IT
BUT IT SHOULD DO WHAT IT SAYS ON THE TIN
THANKS FOR ALL YOUR COMMENTS
FROM TUESDAY NIGHT'S PANORAMA SPECIAL
IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT BBC TV
THEY HAVE LIKE A UNIQUE CHEMISTRY
MANY ESTIMATES SAY THAT FARMERS HAVE LOST BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY PERCENT PER LITRE AND THAT
SO THE TWO THINGS DON'T GO HAND IN HAND AND IF WE WANT A DAIRY INDUSTRY IN THIS COUNTRY
SO HOW ARE THEY DOING THAT
WE WERE GETTING READINGS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE
THE THE TRADE HAS JUST STARTED TO RECOVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT
IT'S A LONG WAY FROM WHERE IT WAS A YEAR AGO
IN ROUNDABOUT TERMS
ALLOWING FOR A FEED COST OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME I'VE HAD THE ANIMALS
MY GRANDFATHER DID IT EXACTLY THE SAME
DAIRY PRODUCTION AROUND THE WORLD HAS BEEN HIGHER THAN EVER BEFORE
SO WE REALLY NEED TO GET IT SORTED OUT BETWEEN US
SO THEY NEARLY BECAME EXTINCT AT ONE TIME
YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE
WE'VE RETURNED TO CHENEY MANOR IN BUCKINGHAMSHIRE
AND A PIECE OF FURNITURE WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN MADE OUT OF ORANGE BOXES OR SOMETHING
UM WHO WAS ITALIAN
I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL WE PUT IT UP FOR SALE
YOU'VE GOT THESE WONDERFUL MANCHURIAN CRANES
UNTIL NEXT TIME
FOR THE FIRST TIME REALLY
THAT NO MATTER HOW DREADFUL THE ALIENS WERE
THAT'S A REALLY LOVELY GESTURE
GET AWAY FROM ME
AND THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING ON UNFORTUNATELY
SO I HOPE IT KEEPS US ALL FIT
IS THAT YOU CAN ALSO ALWAYS GO AND FIND A QUIET SPACE
SO THIS IS BASICALLY MY BACKARD
AND IT'S PART OF THE COUNTRY PARK
I PAY MY BUSINESS RATES
WE JUST CAN NEVER TELL
BUT WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN WAYS OF DOING THINGS
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ASK FOR SECOND OPINIONS
MOUR SAID IT WAS URGENT
AH SORRY ABOUT THAT
IS THIS WHERE YOU REALLY WANT TO GO
LIKE MY OWN BOY
I SAW HIM IN THE LAST FOURTEEN DAYS
TO HELL WITH HIM
I JUST PLAY ALONG
ALL THAT WAS LEFT WAS TO BOW OUT WITH SOME DIGNITY
BUT IF IT WASN'T LAST NIGHT
I KNOW HOW IT IS
DON'T GET ME WRONG
AND I DIDN'T ASK ANY
WE'VE GOT THE BEACH
EVERYBODY IS THOROUGHLY ENJOYING THEMSELVES
IT'S JAM PACKED BACK THERE IN THE PAVILION
IT WAS EXPENSIVE IT WAS THREE
NOT JUST TO GET SOME FRESH AIR
THESE INSTRUMENTS WERE FIRST SORT OF MADE IN THIS KIND OF FORM AND SHAPE IN THE EARLY PART OF THE SEVENTEENTH
CAN YOU SEE THAT
AND PUT THOSE VALUATIONS TO THE TEST
AND ALSO ICONIC NAMES LIKE SALVADOR DALI
WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLY BOLD MOVE
HOME TO THE ENGLISH SURREALISTS
THEY'RE NORMALLY SPOT ON
IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE
SOMETHING FOR ALL YOU TAXIDERMY ENTHUSIASTS
IT'S A WONDERFUL LITTLE TURTLE
THE HOUSE IS FILLING UP
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE BI THINGS
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE
IT'S A ROLLER COASTER RIDE JUST ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE
I KNOW IT WAS A BIT OF A STRUGGLE
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
YOU COULD HAVE GONE TO UNI
I'M TELLING YOU
WE HAVE A GOOD LAUGH
SO YOU'RE BACK AT WORK
YOU CAN BE SELFISH
I WAS JUST REALLY THROWN
I USUALLY CALCULATE ON AVERAGE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE
THIRTY YEARS PER GENERATION
THAT WOULD TAKE US BACK A HUNDRED
I THINK THAT THE CABINET MAKER AND THE PANEL MAKERS ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE
CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT
THEY ALWAYS HAD A WARNING
SHE DROVE THE MEN
AND THEN IT WAS PASSED ON TO MY BROTHER AND I AND WE HAD IT HANGING IN OUR BEDROOMS AS CHILDREN
AS WE CLEAR UP AND CLEAN UP AFTER OURSELVES
I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO COME TO WORK
SO IT'S QUITE A LONG TIME
BUT PEOPLE THEMSELVES HAVE GOT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY BY KEEPING THINGS TIDY AS WELL
MAINLY BECAUSE IT IS A PASSAGE WHICH ISN'T THAT WELL USED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC
YOU WE HAVE A VERY GOOD IN HOUSE WASTE COLLECTION SERVICE
WHICH WAS THE CASE IN HERE
BUT WHEREVER I END UP
DRIVING MUM UP THE WALL
WHAT'S THE RISK OF YOU COMPROMISING SAFETY
MAYBE TOS IN DEBT
I WAS WITH HIM THE WHOLE TIME THIS MORNING
HE'S UP TO HIS NECK IN IT WITH US
THAT'S HOW WE SHUT HIM UP
MAKE A FULL CHECK
IF PROTECTING ME MEANS PROTECTING YOU
THE WORST THING IS
YOU'VE TAKEN DISEASE BONES AS WELL AS THE HEALTHY ONES
PEOPLE LIE IN THEIR HOSPITAL BEDS
WONDERING IF THAT'S THE DAY THEY'LL DIE
LET'S SEE HOW THEY FARE
WHICH IS QUITE NICE
I DO LIKE THIS BEAR THOUGH
I THINK HE'S A LOT OF FUN
THIS IS WHERE ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN
ONE TEN I HAVE ONLINE
WHICH IS PURE QUALITY
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU
OUTSIDE OF THE CASTLE
WITH ITS MAGNIFICENT SQUARE KEEP
IT'S THE TALLEST IN THE COUNTRY
AND IT'S BEEN TOWERING OVER THE CITY FOR MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS
AND I'M HERE ON THE BATTLEMENTS
SO HE DUG A TUNNEL RIGHT WHERE I AM NOW
THEY CAN ONLY GO UP IN VALUE
SO YOU AREN'T JUST A COPY
I WANT TO FIGHT FOR WHAT I'VE GOT
THEY SAY IT'S DOWN TO MORE PEOPLE BANKING ONLINE
THERE ARE WORRIES IT WILL LEAVE SOME TOWNS WITH NO BANK AT ALL
THE NATIONAL GRID SAYS ELECTRICITY RESERVES ARE AT THEIR LOWEST FOR YEARS
ROBBIE WILLIAMS SERENADED HIS WIFE AYDA WHILE SHE WAS IN LABOUR AND PUT IT ALL ONLINE
THE BODIES OF JAINRA LAD
HIS WIFE DUHI
LLOYD'S BANK IS TO CLOSE TWO HUNDRED BRANCHES OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS
THOUSAND JOBS WILL ALSO GO
THIS IS MILITARY GRADE HARDWARE
IT JUST DETECTS THE HEAT
THEY COME HERE FOR MORECAM BAY WHICH PROVIDES THEM WITH RICH FEEDING GROUNDS AND THOUSANDS AND
FILM OUR PURPOSE FOR COMING BACK IS OBVIOUSLY TO ENJOY THE SPECIES THAT ARE HERE
WE'VE BUGGED THE PLACE WITH OUR CAMERAS
BUT DIVING ISN'T AS FREQUENT I
LOADS OF FIGHTING AND PLENTY OF DRAMA
FIND OUT TOMORROW
THINK BACK TO SEPTEMBER
HOW MANY STARLINGS DO WE HAVE AT LE NOSS AT THE MOMENT
AND ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE PASSING THROUGH OUR BODIES AND ARE GETTING INTO THE FOOD CHAIN
BUT WE DO HAVE TO TREAT THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY
SO PERHAPS WE CAN DEVELOP DRUGS WITH WHAT WE CALL A SHORTER HALF LIFE
THEY DON'T PERSIST IN THE ENVIRONMENT AFTER THEY GET OUT OF OUR BODY
THAT BE ONE THING TO DO
OR THE WATER COMPANIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL
BECAUSE THEYRE GOING TO HAVE TO COME UP WITH A MEANS OF GETTING THESE MOLECULES OUT OF THE WATER
THEY HAVEN'T SET UP TO DO THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO EVERYONE THAT TOOK PART
IT'S BEEN A BARNOUT BONANZA
AND THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT REASONS
THERE WERE LOTS OF VOLES AROUND ALSO WE HAD AN EARLY SPRING
LOTS OF BIRDS FLEDGED
MANY MANY OF THEM HAVE HAD A SECOND BROOD
SO IT'S REALLY BEEN A FABULOUS YEAR
AND IT'S NEW AND IT'S EXCITING
HAVE TO MONITOR THE FISH STOCKS
WELL BE BACK TOMORROW NIGHT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK
THEN LET US KNOW VIA THE WEBSITE
WE HAD HIGH PRESSURE
LOW PRESSURE AFTER LOW PRESSURE
JASON TOOK THIS PICTURE IN LONDON TODAY
LATER BUT LOOK AT THAT
TEMPERATURES HEADING UP AS THE WEEK GOES ON
WE COULD BREAK A TEMPERATURE RECORD IF WE GET ABOVE TWENTY CELSIUS FOR OUR WARMEST HALLOWEEN ON
THOSE DAYS HAVE GONE
WELCOME TO MY WORLD
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO SORT OF LIVESTOCK IN THE GARDEN
IT DOES KIND OF FALL INTO AN ENVIRONMENT ISSUE AND WE LIKE TO WORK TOGETHER AND WORK JOINTLY TO SOLVE
HER HUSBAND IS SUFFERING WITH MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE
AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO GO AROUND
WE ARE EXTREMELY DRIVEN
THERE'S A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY
IT'S NOT OVER THE TOP
WE HAVE REGULAR WEEKLY COLLECTIONS AT YOUR PROPERTY
WE WILL TELL YOU WHICH BILL WE'RE COLLECTING EACH WEEK
SO ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS PUT THE RIGHT THING IN THE RIGHT BIN AND PRESENT THE RIGHT BIN
THERE'S NO FLOWERS
THERE IS NO ANNOUNCEMENTS IN THE PAPER SO IT'S A VERY
A VERY PASSIONATE ANIMAL LOVER
POINT ONE MILLION COLLECTIONS PER ANNUM
THE WRONG THING IN THE WRONG BIN
WILL HAVE A FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE COUNCIL
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM
SO WITH THAT IN MIND
IT'S A LOVELY LOT
I SAID IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE AND THINGS CAN GO WRONG
IT DOESN'T GET GREENER THAN AND THAN ANTIQUES
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
AND SUCH A WELL TO DO FAMILY COULD ONLY CALL UPON THE BEST
THE ARCHITECT HE COMMISSIONED WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR DESIGNING THE HOUSES OF
BECAUSE IT IS RATHER DARK
SO I FEEL LIKE I'VE DISCOVERED A BIT OF OUR HIDDEN HERITAGE
AND OVER THE YEARS THEY'VE ADDED THEIR INNOVATIONS
BUT KEPT TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL ELIZABETHAN DESIGN
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS EXCITING
WHEN YOU THINK OF DRESSING
AND VERY OF ICONIC DESIGN
SOMETHING TELLS ME SPANISH ABOUT IT
POUND BUT LET'S HOPE WE GET THAT TOP END OF FOUR HUNDRED
ANY FURTHER BIDS
WE'RE HAPPY WITH THAT
IT'S IT'S A GOOD TIME TO BE THERE BUT THEN
YOU SET YOUR ALARM CLOCK THIS WEEKEND AND GET OUT TO SEE SOME GEESE
THE RED DE RUT
YOU KNOW EVEN WITH ALL THAT FIGHTING
FIGHT OVER FOOD
WHEN YOU HEAR OWLS CALLING
CROWN BECAUSE THEY WERE A GREAT TREAT
VERY FEW MUTE SWANS COULD ACTUALLY FLY IN THE UK
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER SPECIES WHICH MIGRATE TO THE UK
THE BIG PIECE WHEN IT FLAPS CAUSES MASSES OF TURBULENCE HERE
AND SOME OF OUR LARGER MAMMALS
ACTIVELY CLIMBING UP A TREE GIVING
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SENDING THAT IN
AND LOTS OF THEM AGGREGATED ON ANGLESEY
THEY CHANGE THEIR DIET
WHAT THEY DO IS SWITCH FROM EATING INSECTS TO SEEDS
BECAUSE BASICALLY IF YOU COME HERE TO A PLACE LIKE LEIGHTON MOSS AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR AND YOU
SO WHEN WE HAD A CALL IN EARLY SEPTEMBER FROM ONE OF OUR CAMERAMEN
VERY CLOSE TO WHERE HE LIVES
WE THINK THAT THEY WERE THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS A COLD SNAP IN SCANDINAVIA AND ALL THE BIRDS WHICH
I CAN THINK OF MANY OCCASIONS WHERE COLLEAGUES HAVE GONE THAT EXTRA MILE
UM BEYOND WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO
AND WE KNOW WE WORK AS HARD AS WE CAN TO ACTUALLY PUT THINGS RIGHT
BEING ON MY OWN
I'M USING THIS FOR MY SERVICE
YOU DON'T DO RATS ALL DAY LONG
ANGEL IMMENSELY
THESE THINGS HAPPEN SO
AND THEN WE'VE GOT THE PROBLEM OF FINISHING OFF
THEN WE'VE DONE DAWN SURVEYS AND DUSK SURVEYS
THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF ACTIVITY
YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T HAVE THIS LAST WEEK
BUT IT'S IT'S DEFINITELY BETTER
THEN SHAME ON YOU
BUT HERE THEY ARE ANYWAY
WE DIDN'T REALISE IT WAS ARRANGED
YEAH I'M STILL WORKING
WHY DON'T WE CHECK OUT WHAT THE BLUE TEAM BOUGHT
I THINK I ACTUALLY LIKE THE BIT OF BOHEMIAN GLASS BEST
WANTED THE PLACE TO BE
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
ON CURRENT ESTIMATES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO TOO BAD AND ON THAT BASIS THEY ARE NOT GOING TO NEED
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE OLD AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT
I'M FOREVER THE OPTIMIST AND MY GLASS IS USUALLY HALF FULL BUT
WE THINK THAT ALL THE TIME ABOUT SILVER
IN EACH CASE THEY COULD BE IN DEEP TROUBLE
SO WE'RE NOT THE PUSHOVERS YOU THINK WE ARE
DESPITE BEING A COCKY
WE NEED SOME ANTIQUES TO SELL
AND USE SECOND HAND
I ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT IN A CHARITY SHOP ABOUT TEN TWELVE YEARS AGO
SETTLE THEIR NERVES AND LEAVE YOU WITH A QUICK RUNDOWN OF ALL THE ITEMS GOING UNDER THE HAMMER
I KNOW OUR OWNERS ARE FEELING REALLY NERVOUS OR REALLY EXCITED
IT'S A ROLLER COASTER RIDE OF EMOTIONS
JOIN UP WITH THEM
JUST DOWN THE COAST FROM BANGGA
IT'S RAPIDLY BECOMING ONE OF MINE
WHAT DID THIS MEAN TO HER
AND TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT SUSAN
THE WOMAN AND THE ARTIST I'VE COME TO HAVE A CHAT WITH HER SON
SADLY PASSED AWAY HERE IN PORT MARY
LEAVING BEHIND A WONDERFUL ARTISTIC LEGACY FOR ALL OF US TO ENJOY
AND THEY COME IN ALL VARIOUS SHAPES AND SIZES
ONLY PEOPLE IN THE SORT OF THE UPPER ECHELONS COULD REALLY AFFORD IT
THAT'S A GOOD RESULT
BEFORE BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE WITH ROLLED PAPERWORK
WONDERFUL FILIGREE WORK
YOU KNOW WITHOUT BEING RUDE
WATCH THIS SPACE
YOU GET LOTS OF HIGHS AND LOWS AND LOTS OF SURPRISES
AND I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED TODAY'S SHOW
SHE MAY HAVE FALLEN FOR THAT
DON'T YOU HAVE TO HAVE PERMISSION TO DO THAT
TIM COOK IS THE BOSS OF TECH GIANT APPLE
TODAY HE PUBLICLY REVEALED HE'S GAY
HARSH LAWS ON DRUGS DON'T STOP PEOPLE TAKING THEM
TESTING THE LOCAL RODENTS TO SEE WHICH ONE IS THE MOST AGILE
AND IF YOU WERE WATCHING
THEY FOUND THE SWANS
IS TO REPORT ON NATURE
AND DEATH AND INJURY ARE PART OF THAT
AND THE STANCE THAT WE NORMALLY TAKE IS ONE WHERE WE DON'T INTERVENE
THAT WOULD BE UNNATURAL IF YOU LIKE
BUT IN THIS INSTANCE
HIS ADVICE WAS DON'T INTERFERE
CAUSED BY FIGHTS BETWEEN THE OTTERS
THE BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT I'VE EVER
NEW TECHNOLOGY BEING USED TO PROMOTE PROPER CONSERVATION
TRAVELLING FAR BEYOND OUR SHORES AND ACTUALLY CROSSING THE BEAM OF THE GATTEVILLE LIGHTHOUSE ON THE
THIS IS A REMOTE LOCATION
THE FIRST WAS THE SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE
THAT'S ALL RIGHT
THINGS LIKE PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK
BUT WE USED TO GET THOSE A BIT BELATED
I JUST DON'T KNOW MEAN
PARTICULARLY MY GRANDMOTHER
NOT JUST THE AMIEL RAID BUT MANY OTHERS
C WHY HAVE YOU NOT GIVEN HIM THE VC
HE DID WONDERFUL THINGS FOR THE FRENCH
IT WAS OVER AND DONE IN FIVE SECONDS
THERE WILL BE THAT DOCUMENT
ONE DAY THERE WILL BE THAT DIARY
AND I KNOW THAT MY FIANCE
MY LEGS WON'T BE OUT
MY BUM WON'T BE OUT GET I MEAN
MOST OF THE GIRLS I KNOW
AND THINGS THAT SHE'S TOLD ME
IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL
THE MY DAD'S ONE AND ONLY
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THE DIVISION OF GUYS AND WOMEN AND WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SAT
SHE SHOULD BE THE BEST AND THE ONLY
IT'S NOT FAIR ON CHILDREN
LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM
THE OTHER WIFE LIVES DOWN THE ROAD
I NEED TO DO IT
MY MOM DOESN'T WANT ME TO
I DON'T KNOW HOW CONVERTS GET MARRIED
WE INTRODUCE EACH OTHER TO EACH OTHER'S FAMILIES AND WORD OF MOUTH
LIKE THE WAY SHE WAS
AND RATHER THAN JUST LIKE LETTING A DESIGNER SAY
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT CASE
I CAN'T CHANGE THAT
NO ONE'S DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT
AND THIS IS WHAT WE WANT
NO ONE IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT
SO THEREFORE OVER TIME
INTO THE CENTRE OF LONDON
THIS TEAM DESERVE TO DO WELL
NOW YOU'RE ONLY MINUS TEN POUNDS
MINUS FIVE POUNDS
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY
THE FINEST ALES SHOULD ONLY BE HANDLED WITH CARE AND RESPECT
BRINGS ON CELESTIAL VISIONS
THAT'S IN YOUR CONTRACT
WHEN THEY USED TO RELIEVE EACH OTHER FROM DUTY
AND LOOK AT THE DETAIL OF THE CARVING
YOU CAN SIT BACK AND ENJOY THIS
ALL THE INFORMATION IS PRINTED IN IT
BECAUSE THERE COULD BE ONE OR TWO BIG SURPRISES
I PICKED THESE OUT BECAUSE THEY CAUGHT MY EYE
SO PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
A VERY TIGHT FIRST ROUND
A VERY TIGHT SECOND ROUND
CONGRATULATIONS TO HIM
QUIZ AND DO JOIN US AGAIN NEXT TIME FOR MORE MASTERMINDS
AND YOU CAN GET IN TOUCH WITH US VIA THE WEBSITE
AND IT WAS TAKEN BY MACRO MATT
SO WERE GOING TO RESOLVE THE QUIZ IN A SECOND
THE WHOLE SORT OF THEME OF HALLOWEEN
ESPECIALLY ON OUR LIVE CAMERAS
AND IF ONE OF THEM GETS THROUGH THE WINTER
PICKS UP CARBON DIOXIDE
SO BUTTERFLY CONSERVATION WANT YOU TO GET INVOLVED IN A MOTH COUNTING SCHEME
ALONG WITH ALL THE DETAILS OF HOW TO JOIN IN THAT COUNTING SCHEME
MY AUTUMN IS ABOUT COLOUR
MY AUTUMN IS CHANGING WEATHER
EVEN FROM YOUR CAR
AND ALSO ON TWITTER SO
I SAY MIGRATING
BUT THE NEW MAMMAL IN TOWN IS THE BLACK AND WHITE CHARACTER
THAT WE LAST LOOKED AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF URBAN BADGERS
AND YOU CAN KEY IN YOUR OBSERVATION AND IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A NEW MAP OF THE URBAN BADGER
THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THATS WORTH HAVING
THIS TIME OF YEAR WERE CELEBRATING AUTUMN
SUCH AS THE CHANGING COLOUR OF THE LEAVES
IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER
IS BROKEN DOWN AT THIS TIME OF YEAR INTO COLOURLESS COMPOUNDS
BUT THEY DO NOT LIKE WET AND COLD WEATHER
SO WHAT DOES THE WEATHER HAVE IN STORE FOR THE MOUSE
GETTING CLOSE TO TWENTY FOUR AND
THIS WEATHER FRONT WHICH IS ABOUT TO MAKE IT RAIN IN LEIGHTON MOSS
BRINGING IN WEATHER SYSTEM AFTER WEATHER SYSTEM
SOME PROPER AUTUMN COMING OUR WAY
WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL BRING THE STARLINGS OVER
WE HAD ABOUT SIX THOUSAND OF THEM AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK
DID WE GET ANY MORE
MIGHT TRAVEL A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE
CLOSE TO DUBLIN
WHO NEEDS DAVID LEAN
THAT WAS SPECTACULAR
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME
HE'S GOT THE BABY
WE PAKISTANIS NEED TO ADOPT BRITISH VALUES
WHEN A PERSON BECOMES TOO OLD AND FRAIL TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES
AND GIVE THEM FOOD AND WARMTH
THEY CAN TOUCH IT ALL THEY LIKE
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS
CAN I SELL MAR SHAZIA AFTERWARDS
IT'S A BIG DECISION
BUT I'M SURE SHE'LL BE VERY HAPPY
IT'S A MEDICAL INSURANCE FORM AND THIS IS YOUR NAN'S
THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR RACHEL HAS MADE FOR THE FIRST TIME A CUT FLOWER GARDEN AND KEPT A DIARY OF IT
AND WE VISITED HER AS SHE SET OUT SOWN SEEDS AND NOW WE PAY OUR FINAL
VERY INFORMAL AGAIN
I'VE LEARNED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT AND FOR ME THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
SHARING YOUR GARDEN
AND FOR THAT YOU NEED ADVICE
WE WENT ALONG TO RHS WISLEY TO ASK AN EXPERT
SO DON'T THINK OF IT AS THE ENEMY
CAROL HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR GARDEN PLANTS AND WILDLIFE
NOT TIDYING TOO MUCH DOESN'T LET YOU OFF THE HOOK
AND ALSO GIVES A SORT A BIT OF PROTECTION AGAINST HEAVY RAIN
YOU AND CHARLIE
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
I'M TELLING YOU
WE HAVE A GOOD LAUGH
SO YOU'RE BACK AT WORK
I WAS JUST REALLY THROWN
IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO TELL DOT
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
SO YOU'T JUST A COPY
I WANT TO FIGHT FOR WHAT I'VE GOT
SHE MAY HAVE FALLEN FOR THAT
DON'T YOU HAVE TO HAVE PERMISSION TO DO THAT
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME
HE'S GOT THE BABY
AND I MOST CERTAINLY DO
MUST HAVE LIGHT
THEN SCIENTISTS TACKLED THE PROBLEM
IT'S THE FUNGUS WHICH DETERMINES THE SHAPE INTO WHICH THE PARTNERSHIP GROWS
BUT IN ORDER TO SEE THE TWO PARTNERS
BUT FROM OTHER POINTS OF VIEW
YES IN NOT ONE BAND
BUT I DO ACTUALLY PLAY GUITAR
SOMETIMES THE LITTLE BANJO
WE HAD AT ONE TIME A PONY
WHAT A SHAMBLES
SOMEBODY LIKE THAT
FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME
NOW FOR THE BLUES
GEORGINA AND TED
NOW COMES THE BRACKET
OVER THE CENTURIES
WE ALL KNOW WHAT A MOTOR CAR LOOKS LIKE AND IF YOU SAY YOU OWN A MOTOR CAR
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
IT WAS THE PARKER FAMILY
WHEN SAILORS WOULD GO ON WATCH FOR FOUR HOURS AND CHANGE THE
THEY MIGHT HAVE TWENTY
BUT I THINK THAT'S HOWQUEX GOT ITS NAME
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
THAT SCORES OF PEOPLE HAVE TURNED UP
FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY TURNED UP FIRST THING THIS MORNING
PRODUCING AND BOTTLING ALL OF ITS OWN WHISKEY
THAT'S A GOOD RESULT
SOMEONE MAY BE GOING HOME VERY DISAPPOINTED
I'M GOING TO CATCH UP WITH OUR OWNERS
SHOW YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
WE'VE GOT THIRTY TO FIFTY POUNDS ON THIS
THIS IS A LOVELY
THAT'S THE SPIRIT
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE BI THING
IT'S THE JAPANESE BULL BRONZE
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY
TWO TEAMS OF UP TO FIFTEEN PLAYERS TRY TO GET A BALL BETWEEN TWO SETS OF EXTENDED GOALPOSTS
THEY GET ONE POINT FOR DOING THAT
AND I'M SURE IT'S SEEN A LOT WORSE
IT'S NOT DAMPENING OUR SPIRITS
CHERRY AND HECTOR
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT
AND ALSO OF WHERE HE WAS
I LOVE THAT SOUND
ONE LIKE AN ELEPHANT
YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS NEXT LOT BELONGING TO HECTOR AND CHERRY IT'S THAT WONDERFUL ELEPHANT INKWELL
CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT ONE
WHICH IS A BIG COMPANY IN AMERICA
WE GO TO LAS VEGAS
WHICH IS QUITE A SCARY SOUNDING NAME
WHICH ADMITTEDLY ISN'T BRILLIANT
I JUST SAID IT WAS A BRILLIANT CAR AND THAT WAS THE END
I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A FARM IN MY LIFE
SO I PICKED IT UP
THE DARTH VADER
OF COURSE BECAUSE I OWN HALLOWEEN
BUT YOU BURN RUBBER UP
ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT ME OR IGGY OR OZZY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IS PROBABLY TRUE
COME BACK AND HE WOULD BE DRESSED LIKE A FRENCH MAID
I WOKE UP ONE MORNING
AND INSTEAD OF JUST THROWING UP BEER
IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR HOUSE IN THIS COUNTRY
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE COUNCIL FOR PERMISSION
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WATCHING
FULL OF PASSIONS AND ANXIETIES OF THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THEM
AND IF WE SCRATCH BENEATH THEIR SURFACE
WE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFERENT CULTURES
TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ENVIRONMENT
TO IMPOSE ORDER AND STRUCTURE ON THEIR TEEMING
THEY WEREN'T REALLY EVEN INTERESTED IN GETTING FROM A TO B
THEIR INTEREST WAS GETTING PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON A HIGHER SPIRITUAL REALM
ON RISING UP ABOVE THE EARTH AND REACHING UP TO HEAVEN
THEY COULD DIE WITHIN HOURS
ONCE THE OUTBREAK HAD ENDED
THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD LOST THEIR LIVES
HE WALKED AROUND
TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND SHOWING THEM IT VISUALLY ON A MAP IS A VERY NICE WAY
A VERY FRIENDLY
AND HE RECORDED HIS FEELINGS IN HIS NOTEBOOKS
AH BY PUTTING THE PROBLEM ON A MAP
BOOTH MADE IT MORE MANAGEABLE
MANY OF THEM WERE ESCAPING REALLY VICIOUS PERSECUTION UNDER THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE
BUT OTHERS WERE SIMPLY COMING TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR FAMILIES
BUT AT A TIME OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS AREA
THEY WERE SEEN AS A BURDEN ON THE STATE AND ALSO ACCUSED OF TAKING LOCAL JOBS
IN A FEW STREETS
POLITICAL PRESSURE LED TO THE PASSAGE OF THE NINETEEN OH FIVE ALIENS ACT
MAPS ARE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL OBJECTS
THEY TOUCH THE MIND BUT
AND IT WASN'T EVEN ACCURATE ON ITS OWN TERMS
IT FINALLY EXPLODED THE MYTH THAT MAPS CAN EVER BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ACCURATE
OBJECTIVE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE WORLD
THE CRITICS DID HAVE A POINT
THE PETERS PROJECTION WAS FLAWED
IT APPEARS TO BE REAL
IT SHOULD BE MADE MUCH MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE
BUT THE ACTUAL PICTURE OF WHAT IT WAS SHOWING BEING MADE AVAILABLE
AND THEY'LL CONTINUE TO SHAPE WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO AS HUMANS
WHATEVER OUR FUTURE
AND WHAT I'VE ALWAYS LOVED ABOUT THEM IS THE FACT THAT THEY DEFINE OUR WORLD RATHER THAN SIMPLY
THE TURBULENCE OF THE AIR WILL CAUSE THEIR HABITS TO
IN THE MEANTIME
TIM AND GOT HIM ALL ANNOYED
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS TO KEEP THEM PRIMED
AND I SPENT A WEEK RUNNING AWAY FROM HIM
I'M HOPING THAT IT'S FRENCH
IT OUGHT TO BE WORTH ABOUT THREE
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
WHICH IS THE PILGRIM WAY
WHERE DO YOU PITCH UP
I WAS UNDER TIME PRESSURE
AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THAT
THEY CAN BE VERY COLLECTABLE AND VERY VALUABLE
AND A LOT OF CHEAP ANIMAL RELATED SUBJECTS
IT WAS ONLY BRASS
MANY CULTURES ATTACH SYMBOLIC MEANINGS TO CERTAIN TYPES OF BIRDS
AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
QUITE AN UNUSUAL OBJECT
WHICH DOESN'T COME UP VERY OFTEN
WHAT TYPE OF WINGED CREATURE COULD BRING YOU GOOD FORTUNE
THEY HAVE THIS SORT OF
I DON'T I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND TO THIS DAY
WHEN CHRISTINA TOOK THESE EGGS IN
I THINK SHE PUT THE RIGHT MONEY ON THEM
THEY WOULD FLY AWAY NOW
BECAUSE HE REALLY
VERY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THEM WITH THEM
UM AND JUST A FABULOUS
WE'RE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THE WORLD'S FLORA AND FAUNA
DAVID ATTENBOROUGH HAS PLAYED HIS PART IN FEEDING OUR FASCINATION
ANITA MANNING HAS BEEN A FAMILIAR FACE ON FLOG IT FOR MANY YEARS AND SHE REMAINS ONE OF YOUR FIRM
WHEN SHE'S NOT GIVING YOU INVALUABLE ADVICE AT THE VALUATION DAYS
SHE IS BUSY RUNNING HER OWN CELLROOM IN GLASGOW
WHO BETTER TO GIVE YOU THE LOWDOWN ON BUYING AND SELLING AT AUCTION
THERE ARE VARIOUS DIFFERENT WAYS
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF BIDDING
IF YOU'RE BUYING SOMETHING FOR ONE HUNDRED
SO FOR EVERY HUNDRED POUNDS
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY JUST UP THERE HOLDING IT UP
THERE'S NO NONE OF THIS
AND ONE OF THEM HAD A GRIN SO WIDE
JOIN ME AGAIN SOON FOR MORE TRADE SECRETS
YOU'VE GOT THE PEOPLE WHO COLLECT BIRDS
AND YOU'VE GOT THE PRINTING PEOPLE
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE FIFTH THE ONE WITH THE MONEY THE DECORATIVE MARKET
SO I THINK IT WAS A WIN WIN SITUATION
I THINK YOU'LL BE LUCKY IF YOU GET FIFTY
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
RIGHT HERE TO THE BELLY OF THE BEAST
WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE BBC
I'M NOT ON TWITTER
SO I'M NOT ON FACEBOOK
ONLY COVERS HALF THE RACES AND THEN
THAT'S THE ISSUE
THE BBC COMPETES ON QUALITY
THE REASON ITS SO USED BY PEOPLE IS NOT THE CONTENT
MORE WHAT IT IS
THEY TRY AND JUSTIFY WHAT THEY'VE DONE
PROFESSOR BRIAN COX
THE BBC IS VERY
THE LATEST TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY USED HERE TO STRIP AWAY THE ANCIENT DUST AND FIND OUT THE TRUE
THE SCENES AND PLACES CHOSEN TO FILM AND THE WAY THE STORY WAS TOLD BY DALLAS CAMPBELL
THE EMOTIONAL RIDE STROKE JOURNEY THAT JAMES NESBIT TOOK YOU ON RIGHT FROM THE OFF WAS FANTASTIC
HIS ACTING WAS CREDIBLE
THE TIMELINE WAS STITCHED TOGETHER BRILLIANTLY
THERE'S AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE FROM ANOTHER AWARD WINNER
SO FROM ALL OF US
WELL DONE AND ENJOY YOUR NIGHT
WE DISCOVER WHO HAS WON THE PRESTIGIOUS TWENTY FOURTEEN TEACHING AWARDS SUPPORTED BY
PLEASE SAY A VERY BIG BIENVENUE TO CATHERINE TATE
TO PRESENT THIS AWARD
A TALENTED ACTOR
COMEDIAN AND WRITER
SHE'S GIVEN DOCTOR WHO A RUN FOR HIS MONEY AND SHE'S PROGRESSED FROM THE TERRIFYING SCHOOLGIRL
THEY JUST SEEM TO HAVE A FLAIR WITH THE WELSH
I TRIED FOR THREE YEARS AND
AND I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL
WENT BACK TO COLLEGE
TODAY LEVELS IN THE EVENING
GOT THOSE AS WELL
THIS PLATO IS FOR HEAD TEACHER OF THE YEAR IN A PRIMARY SCHOOL
WHERE BETTER TO SEND HIM THAN THE QUEEN ELIZABETH OLYMPIC PARK IN EAST LONDON
WHEN THE WINNER OF THIS AWARD WAS ASKED WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HIS SCHOOL WHEN HE MOVES ON
NO ONE WILL NOTICE
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS RODE IN THE OXFORD CAMBRIDGE BOAT RACE
YET STILL FINDS THE TIME TO BE A SCHOOL GOVERNOR AND WORK WITH YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS AT THE BRIGHT
IT'S AMAZING SHE HAD TIME TO FIT US IN TONIGHT
PLEASE WELCOME DR MARGARET MALFORD
I KNOW JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO ALL PULL TOGETHER
AND I PUT THAT DOWN
AND I THOUGHT WHEN I'D DONE ENOUGH LAW
LOOKING BACK TO THE OLD OLD DAYS
AND NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO NOW
WHO WILL THEN HAVE A CAREER AT THE END OF THEIR COLLEGE TIME
FOR OUR YOUNG LADIES THERE
FOR THEIR BABIES
IT COULD BE A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE
SOMETHING TO WORK EVEN HARDER FOR
FOR THE VISIONARIES OF THE FUTURE
TO SURPRISE THIS INSPIRATIONAL TEACHER
WE ORGANISED A SPECIAL SCHOOL TRIP
CHILDREN FROM WEALTHIER BACKGROUNDS GET THROUGH TUTORS
I TRIED HARD AND I WAS SUPPORTED AT HOME
THE RISQUE TIPPING THE VELVET AND THE NINETEEN FIFTY S MYSTERY DRAMA THE BLETCHLEY CIRCLE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
I WAS TOLD I HAD TO FINISH MY EDUCATION
AND I WENT JUST INTO THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER
CALLED THE LEARNING STORE
AND THEY DO SATURDAY READING
YOU MUST FEEL REALLY NERVOUS
EVERYONE KEPT ON SAYING
NO I'M NOT GOING TO BECOME A TEACHER
HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT MEAN
EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYS
IF THERE IS ONE KIND OF ENVIRONMENT THAT REQUIRES TEAMWORK
BUT IT'S THE KITCHEN
AND OUR WINNERS TEACH HOSPITALITY AND CATERING
WE SURPRISED THEM AS THEY WERE PREPARING FOR THEIR GALA DINNER
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
ACCOMPANIED BY A MESMERISING SOUNDTRACK BY ELTON JOHN
AND SET AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR MINERS STRIKE
BILLY ELLIOT TELLS THE TRULY INSPIRATIONAL STORY OF A YOUNG BOY'S STRUGGLE TO MAKE HIS BALLET
BEFORE HE JOINS ME ON STAGE
LET'S REMIND OURSELVES OF HIS CONTRIBUTION TO THOSE SPECTACULAR GAMES BACK IN SEPTEMBER
IF I'M GOOD ENOUGH
I'D LOVE TO BE THERE
IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC BUT
THE NEXT BIG EVENT FOR ME
YOUR FAVOURITE YOUTH WORKER
YOU TURNED THEIR LIVES AROUND
YOU MADE AN IMPACT ON THEIR LIVES
YOU CHANGED THEIR LIVES FOR THE BETTER
WE WANT TO SAY A HUGE THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE
AND I WOULD SAY
WHAT A WORTHY WINNER
THAT BRINGS AN END TO THIS YEAR'S TEACHING AWARDS SUPPORTED BY PEARSON UK
BRITAIN HAS CROWNED ITS CLASSROOM HEROES OF TWENTY FOURTEEN
CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL OUR WINNERS
YOU'VE ALL BEEN THE TRUE STARS OF TONIGHT AND IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TO CELEBRATE YOUR SUCCESS
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN NOMINATION FOR NEXT YEAR'S AWARDS
I'LL BE DISCOVERING THE SCIENCE BEHIND THAT THINKING
THANKS TO SCHOOL FARMS
BUT FOR HOW LONG
MEANING THAT SCHOOLS ARE FAR LESS LIKELY TO RUN THEM
WITH A SMALLER COHORT OF STUDENTS THAN SOME FACILITIES
OR IN THIS CASE BIOLOGY
SO WHAT COULD BE THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES ON THE WIDER FARMING INDUSTRY
IN THE COURSE OF THE STUDY
SO I SPOKE TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION AND THEY SAID
VERY CAREFULLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FARMERS OF THE FUTURE ARE BEING PREPARED
CONTACT WITH THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT EVERY DAY
SO WHAT IS IN OUR MEAT
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
IT LOOKS AT SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT ISSUES AND ALSO IT ALLOWS LEARNERS AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN
AND THAT'S THE KEY
IS IT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE FIT FOR PURPOSE
I WENT TO AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE
AND WHAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME WHEN I WAS DOING MY O LEVELS
AND BEFORE THE DAYS OF GC
AND I STUDIED CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY AND GEOGRAPHY AND
AND THOSE WERE THE THE SUBJECTS THAT REALLY MATTERED
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IS TO MASTER THE BASICS
I ABSOLUTELY THINK WE ARE DOING THAT AND AND SINCE THEN THERE IS THE SCHOOL FOOD PLAN
LEAVING THOSE INVOLVED FEELING UNDERVALUED
BUT THE VAGARY OVER WHEN THEY'LL BE READY AND IF THEY'LL QUALIFY FOR LEAGUE TABLE POINTS
YOU GET PRETTY QUICK AT IT AFTER A WHILE
I THINK IT'S GREAT
WELCOME BACK TO A SPECIAL PROGRAMME
THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF MILES OF THEM
AND WHEN A SHELL HIT
HE WASN'T ANYWHERE NEAR THE FRONT
BUT AS THE POST GOES OUT AT NINE IN THE MORNING
MY GRANDMOTHER LIVED UNTIL SHE WAS EIGHTY SEVEN
WE'RE TOUCHING HISTORY
WE'RE TOUCHING VERY PERSONAL HISTORY
THE LONDON IRISH
AND THERE WAS THE BALL
I HAVE THIS CONNECTION WITH HIM
WITH AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE
JUST TO ADD ANOTHER CHAPTER TO ITS LIFE
THEY HAD A TERRIBLE TASK AHEAD OF THEM
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO COME DOWN A SLOPE
THEY ACTUALLY TOOK THE WOOD
WILLIE BEING A BENEVOLENT PERSON THAT HE WAS STOPPED HIS TRUCK AND GAVE THE GERMAN
IT'S A VERY SPECIAL MEMENTO AND A REMINDER OF
OR CERTAINLY VERY SERIOUSLY WOUNDED
AND QUEEN ELIZABETH
AND THEN WHEN HE CAME BACK
BUT HIS AIRCRAFT TENDED TO BE PAINTED RED
AND GENERALLY GATHERING INTELLIGENCE
BECAUSE BY THIS TIME
THAT'S VERY POIGNANT
YOU CANNOT CHOOSE IT
AND I THINK THAT FEELS THE RIGHT NOTE UPON WHICH TO END THIS SPECIAL PROGRAMME FROM THE ANTIQUES
THOSE OF THE COMMONWEALTH BUT ALSO
THOSE FROM THE GERMAN SIDE AS WELL
AND A PAST THAT SPEAKS STILL SO POWERFULLY TO US TODAY
AND THEN HE WAS SENT OFF TO NORFOLK AFTER BASIC TRAINING AND THEY SPENT A VERY HAPPY YEAR
THEY FORGET ABOUT NORTH WEST FRONTIER
THINGS WERE GETTING QUITE WILD
AND THE LAST THING
OVER YOU KNOW THE ONLY OPTION THAT'S LEFT IS IS SORT OF HEADING TOWARDS THE COURTS
THAT'S NOT THE CASE
AND WE APPRECIATE THAT
THAT SORT OF JUST BLOCKS OUT ALL OF THE LIGHT OF THE PROPERTY NEXT DOOR
HE'S GOT TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OF MAKING SURE WHAT HE CAN AND CANNOT DO
SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR
IT SURVIVED A COUPLE OF WORLD WARS
WHEN THEY WERE THREE
THEY WERE IN THE SAME PLAY GROUP TOGETHER
SO I'VE BEEN RUNNING IT ON MY OWN
UM SO I CREATE THE ARTICLES
TWENTY POUNDS IS A VERY REASONABLE PRICE TO PAY FOR SUCH A BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED NAPKIN
IF WE GET THE RIGHT PRICE
YOU ARE SUCH A TEASE
YOU DO THAT LATER
KATE PAID SIXTY FIVE POUNDS AS HER BONUS BUY
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
THE EXERCISE IS GOOD FOR ME
YOU KNOW ROLAND
IF YOU WANT TO POP ROUND SOMETIME
I NEEDED TO PROTECT MYSELF
MAYBE A COUNSELLOR WOULD HELP
TRYING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION BUT
THE NATURAL HOME
ASTON MARTIN HAVE LAUNCHED A NEW CAR
WE CANNOT AGREE ON WHICH ONE IS BEST
SO THE PRODUCERS DECIDED WE SHOULD SORT THIS OUT ON A EUROPEAN ROAD TRIP
WHICH IS IN ITALY
WHICH IS ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILES AWAY
I'M DRIVING ALONG
NOT ONLY ARE YOU ALLOWED TO DRIVER ON THE ROAD
IT'S CONGESTION CHARGE EXEMPT
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
I MEAN I'M NOT EXACTLY STEEPED IN F ONE FOLKLORE
WHY ARE YOU BACK
I WAS TERRIFIED
IF HE'D CARRIED ON
MA AND CHARLIE NEXT DOOR
AND I NEEDED YOU TO BELIEVE THAT DAD WAS DEAD
IT'S ALL SWEET TALK AND THEN
IT WAS ELEVEN YEARS AGO
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
WE HAVE TO TRY AND VALUE IT COST
AND MY FATHER WAS THERE FROM
IT'S VERY ORNATE
THEY TAKE THE VIEWER
AND REALLY CONSIDERED
TO THE SPOT WHERE THEY'RE PAINTING
IT WASN'T READY
IT WASN'T JUST ONE
WHEN I WAS LITTLE
AS DAFT AS THAT MIGHT SOUND
WHEN I ASKED WHERE IT WAS
I FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT AT THAT POINT TO MAINTAIN THE PROFESSIONALISM
BRING THEM OUT OF FUEL POVERTY
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CARBON EMISSIONS FROM THAT
SO IT'S NOT LONG TERM
EVEN IF WE DON'T ACTUALLY GET EVIDENCE
BUT THERE IS A NAME
HEALTH AND SAFETY
BUT IF YOU THINK
AND JUST STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT
AND WHEN YOU GET THERE
THERE'S NOTHING THERE
HE REFERS TO IT AS THE VILLAGE
WHAT ABOUT MY LIFE
AND THEN I STARTED TO HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS
PAROLE OFFICER AND A SOCIAL WORKER
THE JUSTICE SESSION THING
WHAT KIND OF PERSON I AM
THE SAME CHANCE THAT YOU HAD
I'M JUST SAYING
THEY WERE SILVER AND GOLDSMITHS
DID YOU HAVE AN IDEA
YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA
YOU MADE IT NOW
BEAUTIFUL SCULPTURES AND MAGNIFICENT STAINED GLASS WINDOWS
IT'S SYMBOLIC OF A SPIRITUAL JOURNEY
IT WAS INSTALLED IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND ONE IN A PIONEERING NEW SCHEME TO INTRODUCE HIGH QUALITY
WITHOUT THE DAMAGE
WHY IS HE SELLING IT
I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THE SHOW
LAUREN GOT YOUR NUMBER PLATE
IN SIERRA LEONE
THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN HAVE BEEN ORPHANED
THEN I'D SAY I'M OPTIMISTIC BUT
IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO
IF YOU REMEMBER YEARS AGO
SO IT'S SIMILAR WITH MICE AND RATS
A MOUSE WILL HAVE DROPPINGS ALL OVER THE PLACE AS THEY'RE RUNNING
I FIND IT QUITE INTERESTING FOR ME
THAT WOULD BE BRILLIANT
THEY DON'T NEED TO GO OUTSIDE
SO I WAS MAKING MY OWN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT MY NEIGHBOURS
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN TO BE GIVING WAY
THERE'S DOG FOULING IN THIS AREA
AND THEY CAN BE QUITE HUMOROUS AND YOU GET TO KNOW PEOPLE
NORTHERN BY THEIR NAMES
I LEFT THE BBC IN NINETY SIX AND I DID A BIT OF TEACHING IN SECONDARY SCHOOL AND
BUT THEN THERES MORE POSITIVE THINGS LIKE CALCIUM AND SODIUM
BUT IN OUR VERSION OF GAME OF THRONES
LET'S TAKE A PEEK AS TO WHAT'S COMING UP
IN TWO WEEKS' TIME
CRAMPS AND STRETCH MARKS
BUT HE'S BEING JUST A BIT
WHILE CARING BECOMES WEARING
AND THE BLOOD PRESSURE READING OF THE
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT AND WITH BIG IDEAS
I WAS PRACTICALLY BEGGING FOR SOMEONE
ONE MOMENT YOU'RE A NIGHTCLUB BOUNCER
THERE BE NO PROBLEM
IT'S IT'S AH IT'S A LOVELY OBJECT
THERE ARE COLLECTORS OUT THERE
DIPPING IN AND OUT OF THE CROWD
LET'S HOPE IT'S WORKING FOR US NOW
BUT YOU RELAXED
IT WAS AMAZING THE EFFECT OF THE COLD WORKS SHEET ON YOU
I'VE COME TO MEET UP WITH RETIRED GP AND MALVAN RESIDENT DR JOHN HARUP
LET'S PRICE IT TO SELL
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT
I DON'T WANT TO LET THEM DOWN
AND HE REALLY LOVED IT
AND DIRAC DIDN'T LIKE TO SPEAK IN FRENCH
THE PREFERABLE OPTION
WHICH IS VERY FORTUNATE
ABOUT TWENTY MEMBERS
AND THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF DISCUSSION AFTERWARDS
AND IT MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY
INDEED BETWEEN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT HE CONTRIBUTED MORE
AND I ENDED UP BY GETTING ON EXTREMELY WELL WITH HIM BY WRITING DOWN WHAT MY ARGUMENT WAS AND GIVING
I WOULD THEN GET THAT BACK AFTER A DAY OR TWO
AND THAT WOULD BE HIS VIEW OF THE WHOLE THING AND I WOULD REPLY
SO WE HAD THIS CORRESPONDENCE AND IT'S MY GREAT REGRET THAT I'VE KEPT NONE OF THAT BUT
THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT
THEY SEE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WAS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ATTEMPT ON EITHER SIDE
AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS VERY UNFORTUNATE
THE TWO GROUPS WERE WORKING MAYBE AS FAR AS TWO HUNDRED YARDS APART IN THE SAME TOWN AN EASY WALK FROM
AS I UNDERSTAND IT
THOSE ARE THE REAL THINGS
IT'S A PERPETUAL
CHECK WITH YOUR FRIEND
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY SENSE TO ANYTHING ELSE
I'VE ALREADY GOT THE PRIZE
THE PRIZE IS THE PLEASURE OF FINDING THE THING OUT
THE OBSERVATION OTHER PEOPLE USE IT
LITERALLY BUILDING THINGS THAT LOOKED LIKE A VERY LARGE FENCE
WITH WOODEN POLES AND WIRES STRUNG BETWEEN THEM
AND IT WAS QUITE A HARD BUSINESS
I THINK SHE MUST HAVE BECOME VERY
VERY FIT BECAUSE OF ALL THAT
JOCELYN WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS OPEN TO THAT
SOMEBODY WHO KEPT HERSELF TO HERSELF
NOT THAT MY MEMORY IS THAT IT WAS A PARTICULARLY SOCIAL GROUP
WHICH IS A BIT FLASH IN THE PAN YOU GET IT
YOU HAVE A FUN WEEK AND IT'S ALL OVER
YOU'RE SAYING TAKING LITHIUM WHILE PREGNANT IS COMPLETELY SAFE
THE CAMPUS AND THE MILL HEALTH CENTRE
IT'S WHAT THIS PLACE NEEDS
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
TODAY WE'RE IN BRISTOL
HOME TO WALLACE AND GROMMIT
MANY MORE WILL TURN UP
THEY USED TO HAVE THINGS CALLED TREPANNING SETS
IF THESE GO UP FOR SALE
WONDERFUL ANTIQUES ALL THE INGREDIENTS OF A CLASSIC CELL
RON DID ME STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO ME
I STILL THINK THAT'S GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY
BUILDING WORK STARTED IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY NINE
EIGHT THE BUILDING IS EXACTLY THE SAME TODAY AS IT WAS BACK THEN
CHAOS BROKE OUT ALL OVER THE PLACE
BUT ALSO A MAN WHO USED HIS GIFT IN A FAIR MINDED AND FORWARD THINKING WAY
IT'S GETTING EXCITING
GET THE BOY ON
NOW THERE IS A NEW RANGE ROVER
IT'S NOT AS BIG AS THE REAL THING
BUT DOES IT WORK
BUT EVEN THE MOST BASIC ONE STARTS AT TWENTY EIGHT
NOW MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A GERMAN WHO WON LAST YEAR'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP
AND THIS YEAR'S
AND IT SOUNDS FANTASTIC
IT MAKES A GREAT NOISE
SO I THINK GIVEN A LONGER RUNWAY YOU KNOW
IT WOULD COST YOU ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE
THAT'S WORKING BRILLIANTLY
SO WE'LL SEE YOU THEN
THIS IS FOR HESTON'S LEAVING SPEECH
DON'T STAND ON CEREMONY
TODAY IS A WORKING DAY
MUCH LIKE ANY OTHER
BUT BE IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING
WELL WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
EVEN AS A PARTNER
OR ANY OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES
WHICH IS A GOOD THING IF YOU ASK ME
AND LET'S BE HONEST
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME
AND YOU MAY CALL YOURS A RETIREMENT OR WHATEVER
I DO HAVE OTHER THINGS TO OCCUPY MY TIME
AND YOU THINK YOU'LL YOU'LL STILL GET DRESSED UP LIKE THIS
I'VE SEEN THE ANGER
STAY IN PYJAMAS TODAY
JIMMY GETS THINGS DONE AND HE DOES THEM WELL
AND WELCOME TO MASTERMIND WITH ME
FOUR MORE CONTENDERS ARE ALL SET TO TAKE TO THE STAGE TONIGHT
THEY WILL FACE TWO MINUTES ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT
IF THERE'S A TIE AT THE END OF IT
PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
THANKS FOR WATCHING
IF SHE WANTS TO DO THAT
MY MUM'S REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT
SHE KEEPS ON SAYING
WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO OVER THE TOP
PROMISE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE WEDDING
WE ARE TAKING OUT THE ROYAL ALBERT DINNER SERVICE
WHEN MR MALIK FINDS OUT THAT MY DAUGHTER IS THE FRIEND OF THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR OF THE FRIEND OF
BUT NOT ALL OUR FRIENDS ARE WEALTHY
SUCCESSFUL AND INTELLIGENT
BUT ON THE OTHER
OR ANY OF THE OTHER RUBBISH
ON THE ONE HAND
I WAS TERRIFIED
AND I NEEDED YOU TO BELIEVE THAT DAD WAS DEAD
IF HE'D CARRIED ON
IT'S ALL SWEET TALK AND THEN
AND ALL THE TIME
LAUREN GOT YOUR NUMBER PLATE
I'M DOING ALL THIS
GET THE BOY BODY WANTS
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS
IF SHE WANTS TO DO THAT
AND IN THE BRIEF SUMMER
IS ONLY A DEGREE OR SO ABOVE FREEZING
EVEN ON VERY COLD DAYS
THERE ARE FOUR OTHERS
WHICH WILL BE ON PARADE HERE AS WELL
FOR MY FIRST LORD MAYOR'S SHOW
I'M UP HERE ON THE BALCONY OF MANSION HOUSE
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT AND WHY WILL IT BE PARADED AROUND THE CITY OF LONDON
YOU YOU ENJOY YOURSELVES
MEET NEW PEOPLE AND MAKE NEW FRIENDS AND THAT IS WHAT THIS SHOW IS ABOUT
MY SON IS ACTUALLY DISABLED
A WONDERFUL DAY
AND I OFTEN SAY TO PEOPLE
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL WHEN YOU SPEAK TO SOMEONE WHO'D BEEN DOWN THERE IN THE SEVENTY S AND JUST
SCOTLAND'S MOST GENEROUS MULTIMILLIONAIRE
AND THIS IS SO INTEGRAL TO THE STORY
HE DEVOTED A LOT OF TIME TO PHILANTHROPY AS WELL AS BUSINESS
WHAT DO YOU BUY SOMEBODY FOR THEIR BIRTHDAY
SOMEBODY THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING
ANDREW NEVER WENT WITHOUT
AND NOW I'M FEELING NERVOUS
I HAD THE CHANCE TO EXPLORE A WONDERFUL SCOTTISH CASTLE
IT REALLY IS AN ARCHITECTURAL DELIGHT
IS FALKLAND PALACE
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ANY OLD ROYAL COURT
WORKING AT THE TOP OF HIS GENRE
NO WONDER HE WAS IN DEMAND THROUGHOUT HIS LIFETIME
THE BEST SANCTUARY FOR REFLECTION
ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEBODY LIKE MARY
SHE WAS DISTRACTED WITH FALCONRY AND HUNTING
WELL HE EVEN HAD JOG HANDLERS
APART FROM THE MORE GENTEEL ACTIVITIES
BUT EVEN KINGS AND QUEENS NEED TIME OFF
ESPECIALLY AFTER ADDING AND IMPROVING THE BUILDING
VERY BIG CIGAR SMOKER
READY TO TAKE THEIR TURN ANYWAY
IN TIME OF WAR
SERGEANT WILSON WILL BRING MY MUM
HELLO TO OUR BRAVE AMERICAN ALLIES
VERY PLEASED TO MEET YOU
EVEN IF I HAVE TO MAKE A PUBLIC APOLOGY
I LOST MY TEMPER
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT
BECAUSE THE HISTORY OF MAPS IS ALSO THE HISTORY OF POWER
GREEKS AND MUSLIMS
ROGER WAS PLAYING FOR HIGH STAKES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
HE'D REALISED THAT MAPS WEREN'T JUST ABOUT THE QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE
HE ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND WHERE EVERY LOCATION IS IN RELATION TO EVERY OTHER LOCATION AND IT'S A
SUCH AND SUCH A CITY SHOULD GO HERE
BITS OF COASTLINE
TITLES AND RICHES
BUT HE WAS RIGHT IN A WAY THAT
ENDED UP BEING THIRTY FIVE
ONE AFTER ANOTHER
THOUSANDMA
THAT HE WENT TO HIS GRAVE FOURTEEN YEARS LATER STILL CONVINCED THAT HE'D DISCOVERED A WESTERN PASSAGE TO ASIA
BUT AT THE TIME
THEY WERE EFFECTIVELY IN CONTROL OF THE MOLUCU
AND THIS IS WHAT I FIND SO FASCINATING ABOUT WORLD MAPS
TO GO TO UNIVERSITY AND BECOME WHAT HE HAS BECOME
THIS IS THE MAP WHICH FOR US IN THE WEST DEFINES THE WORLD AS WE UNDERSTAND IT
STILL TO THIS DAY
BOTH MEN WERE EAGER TO ESTABLISH AN ENGLISH EMPIRE THAT WOULD RIVAL PORTUGAL AND THE GREAT ENEMY
NOT EVEN A PARDON FROM THE KING
THE LEGEND OF HIS MAP OF EL DORADO WOULD INSPIRE COUNTLESS ADVENTURERS TO EMBARK ON
HE CHARGED RALEIGH WITH TREASON
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
THEY TOOK THEIR CHARTS AGAIN BACK TO AMSTERDAM AND THEY SAID
I MADE THAT ONE BETTER
THEY KNOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE
THAT IS A VERY MODERN IDEA THAT YOU ARE SOMEWHERE EXTREMELY REMOTE THAT
THEY NOW TRADE ACROSS THE INDIES WITH OTHER NATIONS
IT HAS NO NO EFFECT AT ALL
BUT THIS TIME THE MAP MAKERS ARE AHEAD OF THE GAME
BECAUSE WHEN THE ICE MELTS AND THE EXPLOITATION REALLY STARTS
THERE WILL BE AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED CHART OF THE REGION TO TAKE THE HEAT OUT OF THE
IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY
WHICH CHANGED THE COURSE OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR SEVENTY YEARS AGO
ON THE MORE RECENT SACRIFICE IN AFGHANISTAN WHERE COMBAT OPERATIONS ENDED A FEW WEEKS
SO WOULD YOU PLEASE WELCOME THE NATIONAL
OVERSEAS AND BRANCH STANDARDS OF THE ROYAL BRITISH LEGION AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
THE END OF COMBAT OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN
IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AGAIN AT THE GREATEST SEABORNE INVASION IN HISTORY
THIS REMEMBRANCE WEEKEND
WHILE HE WAS THERE
WAS WARRANT OFFICER CLASS TWO
WILL BE AMONG THE BEREAVED FAMILIES JOINING US IN JUST A SHORT WHILE
AS I HAVE LOVED YOU
I APPOINTED YOU TO GO ON AND BEAR FRUIT
HAVE BEEN GIVEN AND TAKEN AWAY IN THE CAUSE OF JUSTICE AND FREEDOM
TO GIVE AND NOT TO COUNT THE COST
WONDERFUL APPLAUSE FOR THESE VETERANS
WE MAKE SURE WE CARRY IT OUT
JUST THAT HE IS VERY VERY MUCH MISSED AND
DROP TEN BOMBS
THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD OF WEIRD AND WONDERFUL OUT THERE IN THE HOMES OF GREAT BRITAIN
WE'VE SEEN MOST THINGS TURN UP AT OUR VALUATION DAYS BUT THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR MORE TO GET OUR
THEY ARE A GOOD NAME TO LOOK OUT FOR
YOU CAN FIND THEM VERY INEXPENSIVELY BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT H AND H STANDS
SO IF YOU WANT TO COLLECT CHRISTOPHER DRESS
SHE'S GETTING OLDER AND WE SEE THIS QUITE OFTEN
A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THINGS SOLD IN THEIR OWN LIFETIME
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE IT TO MY CHILDREN
SO I CAN SEE WHY THEY WANT TO SELL THINGS AND ACTUALLY HAVE THE FUN OUT OF SEEING IT SOLD AND MAYBE
THE SORT OF THING THAT WE WOULD HAVE DISMISSED TEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO AS PRETTY SORT OF CHEAP
TATTY SORT OF THINGS
BUT NOW IT'S RETRO
THE MARKET FOR ODDITIES SEEMS TO BE RECESSION PROOF
SO IF YOU HAPPEN ACROSS SOMETHING WEIRD AND WONDERFUL AND IT SUITS YOUR BUDGET
THAT COULD BE HANDHELD TO USE AS A LOOKING GLASS TO SEE YOUR OWN REFLECTION
THAT THE LOOKING GLASS AS WE KNOW IT
SNAP IT UP THERE AND THEN
THIS PROCESS WOULD TAKE HOURS ON A MASSIVE
IT COULD PROVE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS YOU'VE EVER MADE
IT WOULD BE BACKED
GEORGE THE FIRST AND IT DOES HAVE ITS ORIGINAL MERCURY GLASS BACK TO IT AND THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT
IF THIS MIRROR HAD BEEN REPLACED WITH A BIT OF SILVERED GLASS OR NEW GLASS
I THINK THE VALUE OF THE MIRROR WOULD BE FORTY PERCENT LESS SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK OUT FOR
THE NEXT TIME YOU COME ACROSS A MIRROR THAT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS
THAT LOOKS OLD AND USELESS
THE USE OF MERCURY WAS DROPPED AND IT WAS REPLACED WITH SILVER WHICH WAS A MUCH SAFER TECHNIQUE
BUT THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIRROR THAT'S BEEN SILVER BACKED AND A MIRROR THATS BEEN
THE HOUSE WAS BUILT IN SIXTEEN OH SIX
EVERYTHING THAT'S HERE
SOME AS SMALL AS THAT
SOME AS LARGE AS THAT
AND THE VERY LARGE ONES CAN BE TEN TWENTY
IT FLAKES OFF QUITE EASILY SO THE IMPORTANT THING IS CONDITION
HE'S MY FIRST THOUGHT IN THE MORNING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY
THE BIGGEST MAMMAL TO BE FOUND FROM THIS LAKE IN GERMANY WAS A PRIMITIVE HORSE
IT WAS NO BIGGER THAN THE SPANIEL
SO THE DOMINANCE OF THE LAND WAS UP FOR GRABS
BUT A DIFFERENT KIND OF FLIGHTLESS BIRD DOES STILL SURVIVE
APART FROM BATS WHICH FLEW HERE
SOME CAN EVEN FLY BACKWARDS
SOME CAN FLY TO ALTITUDES OF OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
HE'S BEEN BUYING ON A BED ALL WEEKEND AND I' BEING THE SUPPORTIVE GIRLFRIEND
BE A FACE OF THE PRACTICE
AND IF I SMELL THE SMALLEST RAT
THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD
YOU DO BELIEVE ME
I'M CERTAINLY PREPARED TO SAY THAT
THIS IS A LOVELY
SUNNY DAY AND WOULD YOU NOT AGREE
WHEN I LOOK AT THE GOBLET
I ACTUALLY THINK OF THIS
NOW THERE ARE STRICT RULES GOVERNING THE TRADE OF IVORY UNDER INTERNATIONAL CONSERVATION LAWS BUT
IT'S VERY INTERESTING
BUT FROM A CONSERVATIONIST POINT OF VIEW
ELEPHANT POACHING IS CONTINUING
THERE IS ALSO THE SORT OF IVORY THAT WE'VE ALL GOT YOU KNOW
THIS IS OF REALLY SIGNIFICANT HISTORICAL AND ARTISTIC MERIT
DIDN'T APPROVE AT ALL AND
IT REALLY IS THE ONLY TANGIBLE LINK I HAVE TO TO MY COUSIN ONCE REMOVED
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF HIS
THEY USE A BRUSH TO PAINT WITH
UNTIL NEXT WEEK
MAKES PEOPLE'S LIVES A MISERY
IF PEOPLE HAVE GOT WINDOWS OPEN AND STUFF
IF YOU CAN A COMMERCIAL PREMISES
THE MAIN CANAL THAT IN TAMESIDE
THEY WILL WALK ACROSS SURFACES AND
AT THE END OF THE DAY
I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
IT MEANS YOU CAN'T USE YOUR TOILET
YOU WORK WITH POISONS SO YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL
WHICH HAS A DIRECT CONNECTION TO THE SEWERS BELOW
TO DIRTY KITCHENS
OR THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE HERE
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP YOUR WEIGHT DOWN
BUT THIS BIRD ONLY WEIGHS ABOUT A QUARTER AS MUCH
I WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE
I'M NOT HAVING PEOPLE GETTING SICK
I WOULDN'T SEE THEM
I'D THROW IT AWAY
GET THE HOUSE ON THE MARKET
HIT BY THE PLAGUE
THAT SOUNDS FINE NO CHIPS
THANK YOU FOR COMING ALONG
IT'S GOT TO BE VALUABLE
WE FOUND SOME FANTASTIC ANTIQUES
SO IT'S TIME TO PUT THOSE EXPERTS' VALUATIONS TO THE TEST
WHILE WE MAKE OUR WAY OVER TO THE AUCTION ROOM IN WINCHESTER
OUR OTHER EXPERT
CANNOT BE WITH US TODAY
IT COULD BE THREE TO FIVE HUNDRED PO
I HAVE TO SAY MY HOUSE DOES NOT SUIT CLARIY CLIFF SO IF IT WAS MINE
BELONGS TO KEITH
I'VE GOT ONE OF THESE
THIS IS ONE OF THE STARS OF THE SHOW
BUT ACTUALLY THIS TOWN WAS THE BIRTHPLACE OF ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST ENDURING INTERNATIONALLY
BASINGSTOKE STARTED TO THRIVE
AND IT WAS AT THAT POINT THAT A YOUNG APPRENTICE DRAPER MOVED HERE FROM SURREY
HIS NAME WAS THOMAS BURBERRY
AND HE WAS TO REVOLUTIONISE THE CLOTHING INDUSTRY AND TAP STRAIGHT INTO THE HEARTS OF EDWARDIAN
HE MADE SPECIALIST CLOTHING FOR MOUNTAINEERING
BUT EVEN BY THE TIME OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR WHEN THIS PARTICULAR COAT WAS CREATED
WITHOUT THE DAMAGE
IT WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S
AND THOSE LITTLE BITS OF VENEER THAT ARE MISSING ARE EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR
LET'S HOPE IT MAKES TOWARDS THE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS IF
THEN THAT'S A GREAT RESULT
IT'S A GORGEOUS LITTLE THING
HE FELL IN LOVE WITH IT
I CAN'T READ JAPANESE BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT CAN
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT
THAT IS A BIG SOLD SOUND
WE'D ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO SEE YOU
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
I JUST NEED THINGS TO GO BACK TO HOW THEY WERE BEFORE
AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOYS DIED AFTER A CAR STRUCK HIS MOTHER AND HER SIX CHILDREN
IT HAPPENED AS THEY WALKED TO SCHOOL IN CLOCKMILLS IN COUNTY AN TRIM
CONVICTED RAPIST CHAIR EVANS IS TO TRAIN WITH SHEFFIELD UNITED FOLLOWING HIS RELEASE FROM JAIL
A PUB CHAIN'S BEEN CRITICISED FOR THIS DOUBLE DONUT BURGER WITH ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX
REMEMBERING THOSE WHO'VE DIED IN CONFLICTS SINCE WORLD WAR I
THE NATION PAUSED FOR A TWO MINUTE SILENCE
CHARGES WILL ALSO BE LIMITED
IT WOULD BE QUITE SIMILAR TO ONE OF MY CADET CAMPS
WHICH WERE ALL JEWISH PEOPLE
TO A YOUNGSTER LIKE HORACE ARRIVING IN THIS TRENCH
THESE WERE MEN WHO HAD TO LEAD FROM THE FRONT
AND THAT'S THE TRAGEDY
AFTER THREE YEARS HERE
AFTER TURNING DOWN THE CHANCE TO LEAVE
AFTER BECOMING A LEADER AND A MAN
THAT SHE WOULD GO INTO THE DINING ROOM
WE NEED TO KEEP THAT DOOR CLOSED
OR TRY AND PUT EVERYTHING ELSE RIGHT BEFORE THAT OPTION
WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO WITH THIS MONEY
WHEN HE FIRST MOVED IN
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD
I'VE ONLY BEEN STU A COUPLE OF TIMES IN MIL LIFE
THANKS VERY MUCH
IT MAKES ME REALLY PROUD
IF I'VE DONE ENOUGH TO SAY
BY MY RECKONING
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOPPING HERE FOR BARGAINS
I DO LIKE SWIMMING AND I DO LIKE BADMINTON
HOW DO I KNOW THAT
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT
WE'RE HEADING OFF TO THE AUCTION
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT PHILIP'S CHILDREN'S FURNITURE
THE OTHER TWO MAY BE SLIGHTLY OVER THE TOP
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THEIR BONUS BUYY
IT'S A SWEET LITTLE THING
MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES TODAY
EXPERTS ADAM PARTRIDGE AND DAVID BARBY
AND IN THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURY
I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO THE HOUSE
BIG SMILE ON YOUR FACE
I WANT TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS YOUNG CHAP
WHO'S OVERSEEING THE COLLECTION HERE AT GAINSBOROUGH HOUSE
JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM HERE BUT IT'S QUITE POPULAR
I'M SO INTRIGUED BY THESE
DOULTON FIGURES ARE ALWAYS EASY TO VALUE BECAUSE THEY'RE CLEARLY MARKED ON THE BOTTOM
WE'VE CERTAINLY HAD TREMENDOUS FUN HERE TODAY
AND I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK
WHO CAN SAY THAT THEIR DAY IS
THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES
THEY'VE LEFT SOME PLEASANT LITTLE CREATURES BEHIND FOR THE NEXT TENANT
I FLICK THEM OFF AND WIPE MYSELF DOWN AND EVERYTHING
GIVE THEM OUR EYES FOR A WHILE
OUR CONCERN IS REALLY WHAT IS GOING AT THE BACK
IT' NOT IT NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE
AND BUT WHEN YOU GET THE OCCASIONAL ONE
YOU REALISE THAT MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE APPRECIATED IT
YEAH I CAN I CAN SLEEP TONIGHT
THINGS LIKE THAT
DOES IT MAKE SENSE
WE'VE ALSO PROVIDED TOOLS
HE'S NOW THREE YEARS OLD
UM THEY GET MORE AND MORE DEVIOUS
WE'LL FIND TOBACCO
THEN YOU MAY BE CHARGED
I TOLD YOU I JUST
OF COURSE YOU ARE
IT WAS IN THE AIRING CUPBOARD
THIS WHOLE THING'S BEEN A REALLY BIG WAKE UP CALL FOR MOM
YOU WERE EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER
NOW SHE'S LONG GONE
IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW
EVERY SPARE MOMENT
AFTER WORK OR DAYS OFF
THE BOOKS HAVE TO BE FUNNY
WHAT WOULD HE HAVE MADE OF THE MUSEUM DOWNSTAIRS
SHE CAN REMEMBER HIM READING HER BEDTIME STORIES
THEY DO THIS ACTUAL MODEL IN VARIOUS SIZES
ALTHOUGH TO BE HONEST
WHICH IS WHAT I USED TO COLLECT AT THE TIME
AND SO I NEED TO GET SOME MONEY
THAT'S BELOW THE LOW ESTIMATE
ALL FINISHED AT NINETY FIVE
YOU CAN GET US A FLAT
LABOUR LEADER ED MILIBAND HAS HIT BACK AT CRITICISM OF HIS LEADERSHIP
HE INSISTED HE'S DETERMINED TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER
HE PLEDGED TO TAKE ON VESTED INTERESTS
IT'S PART OF A HUMAN TRAFFICKING INVESTIGATION
A CRISIS IN WORLD FOOTBALL
IN A DRAMATIC TWIST
THE MAN WHO CARRIED IT OUT SAYS HIS FINDINGS HAVE BEEN MISREPRESENTED
THIS IS THE FIRST EVER IMAGE FROM THE SURFACE OF A COMET
ONE A MAINSTREAM ROUTE
LIKE MY FATHER USED TO WORK WITH
THANKS VERY MUCH
SO VERY SWEET THING
EVERYONE HERE IS MADE TO FEEL SAFE
EVERYONE'S GOT THEIR OWN STRENGTHS
THERE'S NO WEAKNESSES
WHAT DO YOU THINK
EIGHTEEN POUNDS PAID BY THEM
THE BIG QUESTION IS
ON YOUR ESTIMATE
FOR CHILDREN IN NEED
IT'S THE WAY THEY COMMUNICATE
AND THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH THEY SAY IT
SHE REALLY SHOULD INFORM SOMEONE
THAT'S NOT THE POINT
TURNS UP WHEN SHE SAYS SHE WILL
I BELIEVE MY SPIRIT
NO WONDER THIS PLACE IS A DAY TRIPPER'S PARADISE
WE TEND TO TAKE THEIR PRESENCE FOR GRANTED REALLY
THAT'S QUITE A SURPRISINGLY LOW NUMBER
BUT BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH INTEREST IN BEACH HUTS THESE DAYS
OUTSIDE YOUR OWN BEACH HAT
WHAT COULD BE BETTER
I'VE JUST HAD A FASCINATING INSIGHT INTO WHAT LIFE IS LIKE
OWNING A BEACH HUT
VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OWNERS
AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY
IF I LIVED ANYWHERE NEAR THE COAST
I WOULD DEFINITELY INVEST IN ONE OF THESE
IT REALLY IS THERE
IT'S GOT THE WOW FACTOR
FEELING AS THOUGH THE SOFA FROM UNDERNEATH YOU MIGHT BE SOLD
I DO HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE
WE'VE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT HERE
AND THEY WERE ALL BASICALLY THE SAME
PUT ASTON MARTIN ONES ON
IT'S THE COLLECT THING
A PLASTIC CAMERA
BUT THIS WEEK BBC TWO HAVE TOLD US IT MUST BE FIFTY NINE MINUTES
AND WE START WITH NEWS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF THIS WEEK AND
YOU HIRE A TRACK
ALL THE THINGS I TALKED ABOUT THERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF JULY IN A BRITISH SUMMER
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS LONG
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
BUILDING THE ROADS
CERTAINLY WITH THIS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY
NO WHICH LEFT US WITH TWO POSSIBILITIES
AND THE DREAM FOR EACH IS THAT THEY WILL BE THE ONE TO BE CROWNED THE NATION'S MASTERMIND
THERE WILL BE A TIE BREAK
THE SIX HIGHEST SCORING RUNNERS UP WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO CLAIM A PLACE IN THE SEMIFINALS
SO STILL PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
THANKS FOR WATCHING
DEPENDS WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN NOW AND THEN
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A CONTENDER YOURSELF ON THE NEXT SERIES
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE KNOW WILLLL ALWAYS FIND A MARKET
SO WE WANT TO LET YOU INTO OUR TRADE SECRET
WE WILL BE EXPLORING COMMEMORATIVE PIECES WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR AND WHAT'S BEST TO AVOID
AND IT SEEMS TO ME WE ALL LIKE TO OWN PIECES THAT COMMEMORATE ROYAL OCCASIONS OR IMPORTANT PEOPLE
IS JUST BUY QUALITY
ONCE VICTORIA CAME ON THE THRONE
AND POST VICTORIA
SO PRE QUEEN VICTORIA
I THINK OUR CONTRIBUTORS WERE SECRETLY HOPING THAT I WAS WRONG AND I THINK THEY THOUGHT IT WAS
THEY'RE WHAT WE CALL EPHEMERA
THE QUEEN'S HEAD ON WOULD'VE BEEN MADE
BECAUSE THEY'RE PAPER
MY FAMILY AREN'T INTERESTED
I WAS A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED
I FELT THEY MIGHT HAVE MADE MORE THAN THAT
I SUPPOSE IT COMES DOWN TO THE FACT THAT SPOONS LIKE THIS ARE NOT THAT UNCOMMON IN THE GREAT SCHEME
AND TO BE PRETTY BRUTAL
IT'S WORTH LOOKING AHEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT ANNIVERSARY
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT WITH ALL THE INTEREST FOCUSED AROUND THAT MOMENT IN HISTORY
ITEMS ASSOCIATED WITH IT WILL SPIKE IN VALUE
AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF THEM WERE PRODUCED
NOBODY THOUGHT ANYTHING OF THEM
WHICH WE KNOW IS ROYAL AND MADE FOR THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD
LIKE ALAN AND JOAN
WAS ABLE TO HELP ALAN AND JOAN TO COMMEMORATE THEIR SON IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WAY
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THE SHOW
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED TODAY'S TRADE SECRETS
NO UNAUTHORISED PERSON MUST GET NEAR THE TRAIN
HE'S JUST AS MUCH MY KING AS HE IS YOURS
IT'S THE NOT KNOWING WHY
SHE WAS SEIZING UP
BECAUSE THAT MEANS
WHO DO I SEE ABOUT A DEATH CERTIFICATE
BUT IF I SAID IT WAS DRUG RELATED
HOW MANY DO YOU WANT ME TO SELL
THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
YOU CAN GET US A FLAT
THEY'RE EVEN WILLING TO CONFIDE IN ME
OVER THE PAST WEEK
THE BBC HAS BEEN MARKING THE CONTRIBUTION OF THOSE WHO FOUGHT AND GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR
WE ARE MARKING THIS DAY WITH A SPECIAL POPPIES FILM
I THINK THAT HE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT LESS HUMAN
IT'S BEEN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
HE'S ACTUALLY MY FAVOURITE SINCE THE SERIES RETURNED
THIS IS SOMETHING WE THOUGHT ABOUT REALLY CAREFULLY
SO WE DO FAKE FOR THIS PARTICULAR SERIES IN AUTUMN
HE'S PLAYED BY THE AMAZING NICK FROST
AND TO FIND ANYMORE ABOUT IT
BUT EXECUTIVE PRODUCER BRIAN MINCHIN IS NOT GIVING AWAY TOO MUCH ON THAT
TIME TRAVELLING OF ANOTHER SORT NEXT
AND HOLIDAY OF MY LIFETIME WITH LEN GOODMAN YES
WITH ITS HISTORY
INTERESTING CELEBRITIES AND POIGNANT MEMORIES
LEN'S NATURAL LIKEABILITY
THAT'S THE QUESTION
WHERE DID THE LAND GO
NOT EXACTLY AN APOLOGY
IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ON BBC TV OVER THE COMING WEEK
STARRED AND DIRECTED IN THIS FANTASTIC NEW COMEDY
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEW SERIES
IT'S HEART WARMING
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FILM
UNTIL NEXT WEEK
AND WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE YOU LOVE
MINUTES I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT
THERE IS NO CURE FOR DEMENTIA
AND WE JUST REALLY NEED THAT LAST
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE NUMBERS AFFECTED BY THE CONDITION
THERE IS A HUGE EFFORT GOING INTO THE FIGHT AGAINST IT
AROUND TWENTY THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UK HAVE A CLOSE FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER
ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH UK FUNDS IMPORTANT RESEARCH INTO THE CAUSES OF DEMENTIA
WITH THE HOPE OF FINDING WAYS TO TREAT OR PREVENT THE CONDITION ALTOGETHER
DRAPING CLOTHING OVER THE FIRE
AND FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
AND YOU CAN HELP BY DONATING TO ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH UK TODAY
PEOPLE FIRST CAME HERE IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ON DOCTOR'S ORDERS
AND I THINK THEY'VE COME DOWN TO HER
BUT THEN CAME THE WORST PERIOD OF THE BUILDING'S LIFE
IT'S DOWN TO THE BIDDERS
SO LET'S GET INSIDE
I'LL HAVE THOSE
MY SON JUST LITERALLY WENT TO THE TABLE AND SAID
THERE ARE VARIOUS RULES YOU HAVE TO OBEY IN A GARDEN
THERE WAS A SECRET DRAWER
THAT I'M DOWNSIZING
BECAUSE THESE ARE QUALITY ITEMS
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
WHILE HOPEFULLY YOU CAN REMEMBER
AND WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU
WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE
UM THERE ARE FARY
FARRY IS A SEPARATE CRAFT NOW
BLACKSMITHING IS A SEPARATE CRAFT
YOU'VE GOT THIS
THERE IS A HECK OF A LOT OF
CLEARLY I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PRACTISING FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS
WHILE I WAIT TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF MY LABOURS
SO IF YOU FANCY MASTERING ONE OF THESE CRAFTS
THE PROGRAMME WILL BE IN BERKSHIRE
THIS IS THE FIRST DAY OF LOOKING AFTER HER
I KNOW IT'S CHEEKY
FOR MOST OF THE AFTERNOON
SO SHE CAN PICK HER LITTLE SISTER UP FROM NURSERY
I WENT TO THE CAFETERIA
THERE WILL BE AIRCRAFT TAKING OFF AND LANDING JUST BEHIND US
TODAY'S VALUATIONS WILL BE TAKING PLACE INSIDE THE FLEET AIR ARM MUSEUM
THIS MUSEUM REALLY DOES SUM UP THE HISTORY OF AVIATION
AND LATER ON IN THE SHOW
HERE ON THE BASE
SO I'D IMAGINE THIS IS YOUR OFFICE SPACE
AS WE JOIN UP WITH OUR EXPERTS
IF YOU'RE BUYING
IT'S EIGHTEEN PERCENT PLUS THE V
PAN ARE YOU SURE IN THE ROOM
JUST SEVEN YEARS AFTER CONSTRUCTION STARTED
THE FIRST TWELVE MONTHS WERE READY TO MOVE IN
I'D IMAGINE MANY PEOPLE HAD ARRIVED KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
YOU ARE THE PERFECT MAN TO ANSWER MY QUESTION
WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME TO SAY FAREWELL TO OUR MAGNIFICENT HOST LOCATION
REALLY WORRIES ME BECAUSE I LOVE COINS
JOIN US AGAIN FOR MANY MORE SURPRISES SOON
AT THE END OF THE DAY
THERE'S NO POINT OVERCOOKING IT
IT'S ARTS AND CRAFTS
YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT
BUBBLING AWAY BESIDE YOU
SO THAT COULD BE A BIT OF A BUMMER
I WANTED TO LET YOU DOWN GENTLY ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP
RUN BY AN EXCEPTIONAL LEADER
BUT I'M NOT DEAD YET
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT
EVERYTHING WAS SIMPLE
I WANT A HUSBAND
LET'S PUT IT TO THE TEST
AND THAT WAS EXCITING BUT IT COULD GET EVEN BETTER LATER ON
BYRON FAMOUS FOR HIS POETRY AND HIS PHILANDERING
WHEN BYRON WAS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD
HE ENJOYED PLAYING HERE
BUT HE ALSO CAME HERE TO WRITE
HE WAS NOT TO BE DISTURBED WHEN HE WAS IN HIS STUDY
IF THE DOOR OPENED
HAVING TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF FROM A
HE WAS RUNNING UP ENORMOUS DEBTS
DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES HE THOUGHT OF HIS MOTHER AS HIS GREAT FRIEND
BUT AS THEY SAY
YOU CAN'T TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS
HIS DALLIANCES CONTINUED
DE AND FOUR DAYS LATER
WITH SPIRALLING DEBTS AND CREDITORS CHASING HIM
HIS DAUGHTER TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM FOREVER BY AN EMBITTERED MOTHER
BYRON'S ADULT DAUGHTER
BECAME AN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL COMPUTER SCIENTIST
CREDITED AS BEING THE FIRST COMPUTER PROGRAMMER
WHICH WAS A BIG ACHIEVEMENT FOR A WOMAN BACK IN THE DAY
IRONICALLY SHE PUTS THAT SUCCESS DOWN TO HER ABILITY TO COMBINE SCIENCE WITH POETRY
BOATSWAIN MAN'S BEST FRIEND
WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF BEING BITTEN HIMSELF
HE STRUCK UP A FRIENDSHIP WITH THE GIRL NEXT DOOR
AND HER NAME WAS ELIZABETHLIOT
AND SHE ENCOURAGED HIM TO WRITE POETRY
THEY SENT LETTERS TO EACH OTHER
AND IT'S SAID THAT HER DYING WISH WAS TO BE BURIED WITH HIS LETTERS
AND WE ALL KNOW BYRON HAD A WONDERFUL REPUTATION AS ONE OF THE GREATEST LOVERS ON THE PLANET
BUT HE ALSO HAD A FEW VERY DEAR
THAT WON'T BE RUSHED
HAVE SOME LUNCH
HANDLING COMES FIRST
IT IS BRILLIANT
A COPY OF A MOTORCYCLING MAGAZINE FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX
AND IT WAS THE MODEL THAT WAS BEING USED THAT HAS TERRIFIED US HERE IT IS
BUT IT'S VERY DETERMINED OKAY
SO WE SAID WE'D BRING IT BACK WHEN IT WASN'T
YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO INTO A DEALERSHIP AND SIMPLY BUY ONE BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS
JAMES AND I DECIDED TO DO A SENSIBLE TEST
NO CATCHING FIRE
JUST LIKE THE NISSAD
WHAT ARE WE ALL GOING TO DO WHEN THE OIL FINALLY BECOMES TOO EXPENSIVE TO USE FOR PERSONAL
IT IS NOW TIME TO PUT A STAR IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BANDS SUCH AS BOYZONE
AND YET SURPRISINGLY
WHY ARE WE HERE NOW
IS IT TRUE THAT SIMON COWELL BOUGHT YOU ALL BOTOX VOUCHERS
WHO BETTER TO ATTEND
THAN TOP GEAR'S OWN MINISTER FOR RURAL AFFAIRS
THEY'RE MEN OF ACTION
THEY'RE USED TO HAVING CHALLENGES
MINISTERS CALLED IT UNACCEPTABLE
VIRGIN MEDIA COMPLAINED MORE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR LIVE BROADCAST
I'M A QUALIFIED TEACHER
LOTS OF VERY DEDICATED PRACTITIONERS AND FAMILIES AND I SUPPORT ADULTS IN DELIVERING THE EARLY
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
BECAUSE HE ONLY PAID TWENTY FIVE
WE'RE ON THE EDGE OF THE ABYSS
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
YOUR MINUS FIVE POUNDS
FOR THE CHALLENGE
YOU MUST HAVE SOME KIND OF
THE DOOR WAS AJAR
WE HAVE BEEN BUSY BEES
IT VARIES FROM SALEROOM TO SALEROOM
WHICH IS YOUR FAVOURITE
ALL THE DETAILS ARE PRINTED IN THE CATALOGUE
OR ASK A MEMBER OF STAFF
CASUALTIES STARTED ARRIVING BACK IN THIS COUNTRY
IT'S A RETAILER SYNONYMOUS WITH QUALITY
DEAN LADY STANFORD WROTE A LETTER TO HER SON TELLING HIM THAT SHE WAS THINKING OF TURNING THE HOUSE OVER
DUNHAM MASSEY WAS FULL OF RANK AND FILE
THE CARPETS AND THE CHANDELIERS HAD TO BE REMOVED AND THEN HEAVY
PRECIOUS PIECES OF FURNITURE
LADY JANE SADLY PASSED AWAY
WHO UNDERWENT BRAIN SURGERY
THAT'S A GOOD DAY OUT
US THREE COULD NOT AGREE ON A SOLUTION TO THIS
DO ANY OF THEM SAY
I'M IN THE BOOK NOW
AND THEREFORE I HAVE THE BIGGEST TESTES
THE MCLAREN DID EIGHT MPG AND THE NOBLE DID NINE
WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG WITH MY CAR
RICHARD HAMMOND ALWAYS
THOSE OF YOU WHO SAW OUR CHRISTMAS SPECIAL WILL PROBABLY REMEMBER WE LEFT OUR THREE CARS ON PLINTHS HIGH IN
VERY HARD TO DRIVE
A BLOKE DROVE IT FROM THE FACTORY
ALL THE WAY FROM LEICESTER TO ROME IN ONE HERE
COURSE THAT'S WHAT I CALL SERVICE
I'M TIRED OF COMPLAINING AND POINTING FINGERS
I'VE GOT A PAIR
THEY'RE NOT FASHION
THE FIRST THING I DID WAS A THUNDERVET
I'M GOING TO MAKE MUSIC SO I CAN TAKE CARE OF MY MOM
SO THERE'S NO NO FOR AN ANSWER
BECAUSE IT'S TIME NOW FOR PART THREE
IN WHICH WE THREE MUST FACE THE MOST DANGEROUS THING WE'VE EVER DONE
ATTEMPTING TO BEAT THE TIME SET BY A FERRARI FOUR FIVE EIGHT
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR WATCHING
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK
BUT ARE WE GOING TO SEE A PROFIT IN IT
IT COULD MAKE FORTY
HOW FAR IS THE CONCORDE AWAY
TO EXETER MUSEUM
THE FACT THAT HE GOT KICKED OUT WITH SOME LOYAL
OLD CREW MEMBERS AND THE VESSEL EVENTUALLY WAS DESTROYED AT THE ISLAND OF PITCAIRN
IT WAS A MARK OF PRESTIGE
THEY NEVER FOUND THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE
WHICH REMINDS ME
ALL THE WAY UP TO ALASKA
HE STARTED TO COLLECT NATIVE OBJECTS
AS AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD
WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE RARITY OF HENS' TEETH
BUT FOR THE VIEWERS AT TIME
THAT GENIUS CHARLIE ROSS ONLY PAID FIFTEEN POUNDS
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BID SIX
AND GET ON THE PHONE TO THE
BETTER START LOOKING FOR ANOTHER RANDY OLD FOOL
I DON'T BELONG TO THE RIGHT CLUB
I'LL CALL THE POLICE RIGHT NOW
SHE'S THE NOT SO GRIEVING WIDOW
IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT
AND HE WAS VERY COMPLIMENTARY ABOUT MY FRENCH
FORGET MUTUAL AFFECTION AND RESPECT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME HOME WITH ME
YOU HAVE A VERY BEAUTIFUL SMILE
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD
FOR A MOMENT THERE
TO ASK THAT ALL IMPORTANT QUESTION
LET'S HAND THE PROCEEDINGS OVER TO DAVID FLETCHER
SOMEONE WHO IS AWARE
THE LIMESTONE'S HOLDING IT ALL TOGETHER
THAT'S A GREAT TOUCH
THE EXPERTS REGULARLY ON THE SHOW
IF YOU DON'T MY CATALOGUE
ASK A MEMBER OF STAFF
BECAUSE IT DOES VARY
I WENT ALONG TO A LOCAL BEACH
AND MARY'S FATHER SADLY PASSED AWAY
SHE WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD AT THE TIME
TO PREVENT THE FAMILY FROM MOVING INTO THE POORHOUSE
MARY AND HER BROTHER
WHATEVER THE WEATHER
THE WORSE THE WEATHER
IT CAME FROM MY HUSBAND'S GREAT AUNT
TO HAVE THAT AMOUNT OF CHARMS
POS CARES ABOUT WHAT
OUR VALUATION DAY VENUE
IT COULDN'T BE A BETTER SETTING
FOSSILS ARE ONE THING BUT
IT'S TIME TO RECAP ON SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE RECENT
YOU DROVE HERE TODAY
THE SNP LEADER IS THE FIRST WOMAN TO HOLD THE TOP JOB
YOU HAVE A LOVELY CAT
THAT IS A TRIP HAZARD
WELL I WAS A LITTLE BOY AND I WAS JOINING MY DAD WHO WORKED ABROAD
WE WENT IN AN OLD ARGONAUT
WE HAVE SOME SUPREME TEAMS ON BARGAIN HUNT
THAT WAS FAR TOO MUCH
THAT MEANS THAT THE ASRAS NOTEBOOK HOLDER WOULD ONLY COST YOU SEVENTY FIVE
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT ANYTHING BETWEEN FIFTEEN
WHAT DO YOU THINK
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
ON THE OTHER HAND
THEY MAY HAVE RECOURSE TO THEIR BONUS BUY
FIVE TO TEN POUNDS YOU'VE GOT
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
AS A KID YOU READ THESE
THAT'S A LOVELY PREDICTION
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
DIM WITTED DOG BREATH LIKE YOU
GET ONE OVER ON ME
I'M UP TO MY EYES IN IT YOU
SHE ENDS UP GETTING ARRESTED FOR SHOPLIFTING
AND HE DOES A FINE JOB
AS HE LAY DYING
I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE WEARING
A DUTY TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT THE BYRON LEGACY
IT IS LITERALLY SET IN STONE
NOT JUST FOR THEIR GENERATION TO PAY HOMAGE TO BYRON BUT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS SO PEOPLE LIKE US
THAT'S A SHOWY PIECE
GOOD LUCK WITHOUT AND GOOD LUCK
IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE
TONIGHT'S CONTENDERS WILL EACH MAKE THE SHORT BUT DAUNTING WALK TO THE BLACK CHAIR WHERE THEY WILL
THE SPECIALIST SUBJECTS
THERE WILL BE A TIE BREAK
THE SIX HIGHEST SCORING RUNNERS UP WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO CLAIM A PLACE IN THE SEMIFINALS SO
STILL PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
AND DO JOIN US AGAIN NEXT TIME FOR MORE MASTERMIND
AND THANKS FOR WATCHING
YOU CAN'T FACE HIM BOWLING OVER
YOU'RE MY WORLD
I'D GIVE IT BACK BUT
YOU HAVE TO PUT THE WASHING IN
WE'VE HAD TO LIMIT IT TO FOUR PER CUSTOMER OTHERWISE PEOPLE WOULD BE TAKING THEM AWAY BY THE
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO
IT'S VERY INTERESTING
THEY GAVE US ALL DETAILS OF A MURDER CASE
IN DETECTIVE WORK
YOU ARE A NAPPY DEALER
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LIKE
I'M ARRESTING YOU FOR THE MURDER OF
I LOOKED IN HIS WALLET
I HAD TO KEEP YOU AWAY
YOU CAN'T FACE HIM BOWLING OVER
I'D GIVE IT BACK BUT
THIS COULD GET TENSE
SO IT'S NOT CHEAP
MY FAVOUR WATER
THEY'VE SEEN IT
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
THAT'S MY PROBLEM
YOUR MOMENT WILL ARRIVE
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW
I'M IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE NOW
HE WAS SECTIONED TEN YEARS AGO
RELEASED SEVEN YEARS AGO
IT WAS REALLY HORRIBLE
I MET THIS PRIEST
WHILE YOU SIT AROUND HERE ALL DAY
AND THE RESTAURANT
BEING ON THE OUTSIDE
AND AS SOON AS WE MET
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING SO
WHEN I GET TO MY TEST
HE SLAMS HIS BRAKES ON
BUT TONY WON'T LET ME
WE GOT THE HOUSE FROM SPENCER'S IN THE END ANTHONY SPENCER
WILL YOU TRY THIS FOR ME
NOW THIS IS SOMETHING I I ALWAYS USED TO TELL MY CUSTOMERS
I HAVEN'T GOT ANY
BUT I HAVE PUT A FEW THINGS UPSTAIRS
DON'T GET ME WRONG SU
WHATEVER YOU SAY ABOUT HIM
THAT'S A GOOD JOB
IT'S QUITE LONG TRAINING
SHE MAKES ME DIE
AND YOU SEE I MET TONY AND WE WERE MARRIED WITHIN A YEAR
YOU KNOW WHAT KIDS ARE LIKE
LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THIS WAY
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS WORKING IN INTENSIVE CARE
HAVE MY HAIR DONE
APART FROM THAT
I DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THEM
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT
ON THE FIRST DIP
EVERYBODY IS GETTING VERY CLOSE TOGETHER NOW
THE LIVING HALF LADY
SO SEX WAS AN IMPORTANT INGREDIENT
THE ELECTRONS HAVE GONE WRONG
HES THE ONE WHO WHO SEARCHES AND FOR THE ACT
THE ONE WHO BOOKS THE ACT
AND ANNIE WOULD ADVERTISE ANYTHING AND IT WAS ALWAYS THE LATEST WONDER OF THE AGE
YOU LOOKED AT SOMEBODY WHO HAD A TALENT OR SKILL
THESE PEOPLE WERE CELEBRITIES
THE GREAT BRITISH SHOWMAN
BECAUSE IN REAL LIFE
HE NEVER EXISTED
AND THE ACCOUNTS WE HAVE
ANTHONY HOPKINS IN THE MOVIE AND
TREES DOESN'T EVEN GET THE MAN'S NAME RIGHT
HE'S CALLED JOHN MERRICK
WHEN THOMAS HURST BROUGHT A STEAM POWERED ROUNDABOUT
WHAT THEY DID WAS BRING THE LATEST MODERN ASPECT OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION STEAM POWER INTO AN
BUT HE WAS A GREAT ONE FOR TAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS AND MAKING THEM WORK
THIS SUCCESSION OF RIDES THAT HE HE BUILT FROM THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY S ONWARDS BECAME
BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO STOKE THE BOILER AND GET STEAM UP
THE SAME TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE SENDING STEAM SHIPS OUT ACROSS THE WORLD AND AND AND
ALL SORTS OF STUFF
THE MID NINETEENTH CENTURY
THEY COMMISSIONED TITLES
WHAT THEY DID HAVE
BREAKING INTO THEIR WORKADAY EXISTENCE WERE THE TRADITIONAL ASPECTS OF WORKING CLASS LIFE
AND THAT IS FESTIVALS AND FEAST DAYS
OR IN THIS INSTANCE
PARTICULARLY HAVE THE LATER WORKMEN'S INSTITUTES
VERY FIT COLLIERS BY AND LARGE
YOU'RE A COLLEAGUE
OF COURSE YOU' GOING TO KNOCK THIS GUY OUT
AND WITH HIS PHYSICAL FITNESS AND HIS STAMINA
AS AN EXPERT KNOCKOUT ARTIST
HE COULD KNOCK PEOPLE OUT BY A COMBINATION OF
THIS BOXING BOOTH PHENOMENON
THE WAY THAT THE PEOPLE COME ON TO THE RING
PEOPLE DON'T THINK OF IT AS A SPORT
THE WAY THEY ISSUE THE CHALLENGE
THE WHOLE SHOWMANSHIP
ARE YOU READY TO RUMBLE
THAT'S JUST LIKE
THEY DIDN'T HAVE LIGHTING IN THEIR HOUSES
THE MAN BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL
PURELY FROM THE SHOWMEN
AND TO BUY A SPITFIRE FOR THE NATION BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY
SHE WAS THE PIN UP GHOST
BUT I WANTED TO HELP MY FATHER
AND THE RIFLE I WAS USING WAS A PUMPIAN RIFLE AND AS YOU DID THAT
THE EMPTY CARTRIDGE
I USED TO ENJOY PERFORMING
YOU KNOW AND WHEN THEY GOT USED TO SEEING ME WITH THE SMALL SNAKE
I NEVER HELD A SNAKE'S HEAD LIKE THAT
BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT A STAGE
UPON WHICH MODS AND ROCKERS CAN COME AND PREEN AND EXHIBIT THEMSELVES
TO EYE ONE ANOTHER UP
YOU COULDN'T GO ON YOUR OWN
OR UPON THE FERRIS WHEEL
IT WAS IT WAS A TEENAGE BOY AND GIRL SITUATION
OR THE GHOST TRAIN
LATE LAST NIGHT
WHEN THE SQUIRE CAME HOME
LOOKING FOR HIS LADY
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHERE MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE MIGHT GO TO BUY POSH CHEESES
SO THEY COME ALONG AND
BECAUSE IT HAPPENED
AND THERE'S SOMETHING QUITE MAGIC ABOUT THAT
THE RINGS APPEAR
PAUL'S A HOST AT ONE OF THE LOCAL HOTELS IN TORQUAY
AND IN THE HOTEL ON CHRISTMAS DAY
I OBVIOUSLY SING A FEW SONGS
TELL A FEW GAGS
FIRST ONE BEING TAXIDERMY
THEIR GAME SPECIMENS AND WHATNOT
SO OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT SIDE OF IT IS A MUCH SMALLER MARKET TODAY
BUT THEY ARE STILL ABOUT
DEFINITELY BUY IT OKAY
YOU DIDN'T GO AND SEE YOUR GP
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS IS WHERE TIME BETWEEN THE ESSENCE
SO MAYBE FISH OF TOPSHAM AND EXTRA BEING ITS PLACE OF ASSAY ALL THOSE YEARS AGO
IN A FAIR OR ANTIQUE CENTRE LIKE THIS
WE DID ACTUALLY SAY BEFORE COMING IN
AND THAT CAME UP
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
IS THAT TRUE OR FALSE
WE CAME OFF THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE EDGE OF A WONDERFUL FISH SLICE THAT COST A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
S IN THE ROOM
WHEN IT COMES TO US
WE ALSO LOOK AT THE WIDER FAMILY
WHEN PEOPLE START TALKING ABOUT ENGAGEMENT AND PROCESS
TWO TEAMS FROM THE CAPITAL
TELL ME ABOUT IT
BRETT WAS FULL OF TALK OF PROMOTION
MY PLAYING CAREER WAS WRECKED BY INJURY
WE WERE TWO PEOPLE DIVIDED BY SEVERAL CENTURIES
AS A SPECIAL TREAT THIS WEEK
WHY DON'T YOU DO THE POWER TEST
GET YOURSELF DOWN TO THE TRACK BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND A CAR THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MADE SPECIFICALLY
IT IS TIME TO DO THE NEWS
I START OFF WITH SOMETHING VERY EXCITING
SO THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED
IT WAS A COP SHOW IN ESSENCE
WEVE WANTED TO MAKE A PROPER MOVIE CAR CHASE
THAT'S GOOD NEWS
I HAD A PROBLEM
BUT IF I PULL THE OTHER ONE
THE LAST MINUTE
WE'LL PICK THAT UP LATER ON
UM ALL DIFFERENT SORTS
SO FROM THE MOMENT I GOT THERE
I WAS AH I WAS A MARKED MAN
WHAT WE DID WAS
I HAVEN'T DONE THAT SINCE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL
IN WALKS DENZEL WASHINGTON'S CHARACTER
WHO'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE WORLD'S WORST MURDERING
HE'S GOING TO BE VERY GOOD LOOKING IMMENSELY
THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW DISAGREEMENTS
JEREMY WANTS THE ACTION TO BE REALISTIC
WHICH MEANS BORING
FULL OF STUNTS AND MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS
IT IS TIME TO END
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WATCHING
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK
YOU CAN BE OUTLESS BOY SOMETIMES
SENDING HIM AWAY LIKE THAT
I NEED TO ASK AGAIN ABOUT BOBBY'S FRIENDS
YOU ARE INCONSIDERATE
I SAID I'M SORRY
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY
HE'S NOW IN A MEDICALLY INDUCED COMA
THE HARDEST THING I HAD TO DO WAS TO LEARN TO WALK UP THIS ROPE LADDER
AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
AND YOU KNOW THE TRICK YOU'RE GOING TO DO NEXT IS A GOOD ONE
POP STAR STATUS
YOU WERE FACED WITH SOMETHING
WHICH WAS A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH
TO BE OBSERVING SOMEBODY TAKING THEIR LIFE INTO THEIR HANDS
IT'S PART OF IT
IT'S PART OF THEIR LIVES
SECOND TENT MASTERS
WE HAD A COMPLETE
AND I CAN AND I CAN KIND OF IMAGINE THAT BEING SORT LIKE THE NEWS AT TEN
HEAR ABOUT THE REVOLUTION
AND THEN THEY COULD GO TO ATHLETES AND SEE IT BEING PERFORMED
SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING
GET AN ARCHITECT TO DRAW UP A PLAN
PUT THE BUILDING UP
THEN WHEN THEY'D EXHAUSTED THE AUDIENCE
DISMANTLE THE BUILDING
SELL IT BACK TO THE WOOD YARD
AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TOWN AND REPEAT THE PROCESS
BECAUSE ALLOWING THE SMARTS ALLOWED THE CIRCUS TO BE FILMED
IT ACTUALLY GOT IT TO A WIDER AUDIENCE
SO IN SOME WAYS IT WAS THEIR BEST ADVANCE PUBLICITY THEY COULD GET
AND WINSTON CHURCHILL WAS THERE
IT HAD ONE VERY
BUT HERE WAS A WEST END SHOW FROM LONDON THAT CAME AND PARKED AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY
AND WET TO WEAR HIGH HEELS AS WELL
SO THE ONE THAT I WAS STOOD NEXT TO
BUT YOU WE NEEDED THE MONEY
HALF TERM IN FEBRUARY
I JUST DON'T KNOW FROM THAT DAY I JUST WANTED TO BE THE BOSS
AND THAT WAS IT
AND WE'D HAVE SHOWS AT FIVE O'CLOCK
SO WE'D WE'D GET UP AT SIX O'CLOCK
WE DRIVE THROUGH TO THE NEXT TOWN
UM PROBABLY ONLY MOVING FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MILES
BUT THOSE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN
THE BIG ANIMAL CIRCUS WERE BEING FORCED OUT OF THE TOWNS
WEREN'T AS VISUAL
WE WENT OFF TO THE MIDDLE EAST
BUT HAD THIS CULTURE
SO YOU HAVE THIS OWN LANGUAGE
YEAH TO REALLY PROVE YOURSELF
BECAUSE THEY DID BECOME PART OF THE FAMILY
WE WERE ABLE TO HIRE BILLY SMART'S ELEPHANTS
I JUST FIND IT REALLY
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
WHEN THEY WON THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP
AND WE'VE BEEN MOTORING WITH THE FAMILY
SITTING AS IT DOES
WAS THIS DELIGHTFUL LITTLE TABLE
YOU HAVE BOUGHT TWO ITEMS
CAROLYN AND CLARK
I HAVE A FUNNY FEELING THAT OVERALL
WITH CHARLES HANSON
THEY WENT IN AT THE TOPS
YOU'RE IN AT THE BOTTOMS
AND I LIKE THIS DISH
WHICH IS NOTHING
SO THAT SOME PARTS OF IT ARE IN SUN ALL THE DAY
THOSE THAT ARE WOODLANDERS LIKE SHADE
IF YOU REACH OUT TO SOMEBODY
MOST OF THE TIME
YOU WOULD THINK THAT WE WERE ALL SINGLE
WE'VE TRACED HER EX HE'S IN LONDON
SHE'D BEEN DEAD FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME
AND SHE MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN DEPRESSED
BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU
WHY WOULD THEY NOTICE IT MORE THAN JEANIE WHEN SHE WAS THERE ALL THE TIME
I UNDERSTAND BLOWING OFF STEAM
SHE BOTH SO MUCH
TOMORROW THEY MIGHT TAKE SIERRA AWAY
AND BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN
HOW ABOUT THAT FOR A VENUE TODAY
IT'S MADE OF GLASS
I LOOK AT IT AND I THINK
LET'S SEE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
VIEW THE OBJECTS
BUY A CATALOGUE
EVERYONE HAS TO PAY THAT
WE ARE COMING BACK LATER ON
WHEN I PUSHED HIM
THE QUIZ SHOW WHERE THE AIM OF THE GAME IS TO SCORE AS FEW POINTS AS YOU CAN AND TO DO THAT
YOU NEED TO COME UP WITH THE ANSWERS THAT NO ONE ELSE COULD THINK OF
MY NAME IS CAROL AND THIS IS MY FRIEND
BRIAN AND ARTHUR DIDN'T WIN THE JACKPOT LAST TIME SO WE ADD ANOTHER ONE
YOU SAW WHAT PETER WAS LIKE AFTERWARDS
YOU'RE BEGINNING TO TALK LIKE YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS
SO WE'VE GONE FROM I'M NOT SAYING IT MAKES SENSE TO PETER DEFINITELY DID IT WHAT
HE LOST A LIBEL CASE AFTER A JUDGE SAID HE WAS SATISFIED HE DID
TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN PAID TO AUSTRALIAN CRICKETER PHILLIP HUGHES
IT MEANS NET MIGRATION THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE ARRIVING AND LEAVING IS NOW HIGHER THAN AT THE
GET MARRIED AND LOOK AFTER A PET
WHEN YOU'VE GOT A MOMENT
AND WE NEVER DID FIND THEM
THE VICTORIANS WERE MASTERS OF DISPLAY
AND WHAT THEY WANTED IN THEIR CONSERVATORIES WAS IMPACT
ESCAPE THE WORRIES OF THE WORLD AND BE FACED WITH A DISPLAY THAT WOULD QUITE SIMPLY
IN VICTORIAN TERMS
FROM BEING QUITE FLAT
AND YOU'RE SURPRISED WHEN YOUR HAIR SCREAMS
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
I HAVE NO INTEREST WHATSOEVER IN WOMEN'S HAIR
VAN MADE THAT VERY CLEAR
AGREE A WAY FORWARD
EVEN IF THEY LET ME KEEP SIERRA TODAY
I'M DOING MY BEST
WITHOUT A DOUBT
IT ALL SLIPS AWAY
AND THEY'D BE RIGHT
I JUST I KNOW WHAT I'M LIKE
CAN I COME BY AND WATCH
NOT GETTING YOU HELP ALL THOSE YEARS AGO
I'D NEVER SAY THAT
THIS IS HARD BECAUSE
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU
RUNS RINGS AROUND THE REST OF US
AND WELCOME TO MASTERMIND
WILL GO THROUGH TO THE NEXT ROUND AND BE ON COURSE TO BECOME THE NEXT MASTERMIND CHAMPION
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A CONTENDER ON THE NEXT SERIES
AND PLEASE NEXT TIME FOR MORE MASTERMIND
THANKS FOR WATCHING
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER ANYWAY
YOU ARE ANGRY AND YOU'VE EVERY RIGHT TO BE
EVERY TIME I CALL
ORGANIC IS HOW FOOD IS MEANT TO BE
IF YOU STICK AROUND
I CAN SEE IT A MILE AWAY
BUT NOT THE PIGS
HE'S SWITCHED HIS PHONE OFF
IT'S THE BEARDS
WHEN THE ROYAL CAR ARRIVES
GOING ON THE RUNNY THEORY IS A GOOD IDEA
AND THE RESTAURANT
BEING ON THE OUTSIDE
SENDING HIM AWAY LIKE THAT
HE'S BEEN MISSING A WHOLE NIGHT NOW
I NEED TO ASK AGAIN ABOUT BOBBY'S FRIENDS
I SAID I'M SORRY
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY
THAT'S WHY HE
IS A MASSIVE PAIN
YOU SAW WHAT PETER WAS LIKE AFTERWARDS
SO WE'VE GONE FROM I'M NOT SAYING IT MAKES SENSE TO PETER DEFINITELY DID IT WHAT
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER ANYWAY
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TURNING THINGS AROUND
YOU ARE ANGRY AND YOU'VE EVERY RIGHT TO BE
SHE WASN'T A PERFECT LITTLE ANGEL
EVEN WHEN THEY SURFACE THEY OFTEN
BLUE WHALES HAVE HARDLY EVER BEEN FILMED
AND TODAY WE'RE IN THE MOST STUNNING PART OF THE WORLD
WE'RE IN NORTH WALES
AND IT A SECOND HAND
I ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT IN A CHARITY SHOP ABOUT TEN
I HAVEN'T WORN IT
IT'S NOT THE SORT OF THING I WOULD WEAR
SO I THINK IT WILL MAKE TWENTY TO FORTY
THEY LOVE ARCHITECTURE
THEY LOVE HISTORY
IT WAS ONCE A FORTIFIED HOUSE
SETTLE THEIR NERVES AND LEAVE YOU WITH A QUICK RUNDOWN OF ALL THE ITEMS GOING UNDER THE HAMMER
RIGHT NOW I KNOW OUR OWNERS ARE FEELING REALLY NERVOUS OR REALLY EXCITED
THAT'S AUCTIONS FOR YOU
IT'S A ROLLERCOASTER RIDE OF EMOTIONS
SO I'M GOING TO GO INSIDE AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE FEELING OK
JOIN UP WITH THEM
THERE'S A WATER TANK
AND JUST DOWN THE COAST FROM BANGGA
THE WOMAN AND THE ARTIST
WHAT DID THIS MEAN TO HER
LEAVING BEHIND A WONDERFUL ARTISTIC LEGACY FOR ALL OF US TO ENJOY
WITHOUT BEING RUDE
CASH FOR THE HOSPICE
BUT NOT A FIXED RESERVE
THE MORE YOU GO AROUND THE BLOCK
TILL THE NEXT TIME
YOU GET LOTS OF HIGHS AND LOWS AND LOTS OF SURPRISES
AND I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED TODAY'S SHOW
BUT UNDER THE TOP GEAR APPRENTICE DRIVER TRAINING SCHEME
I HAVE AGREED TO LET THE GUY BEHIND ME
IS IT ANY KIND OF MATCH FOR THE NON CAR THING WE'VE GOT LINED UP FOR TODAY
DEPLOYS PARACHUTE AND ALL SORTS OF TECHNICAL ROCKET MAN STUFF HAS TO HAPPEN
BUT DON'T WORRY
AND NOT IN A BOMBER
HE MUST WOKEN UP ONE DAY THE
I NEED TO STRETCH MY LEGS
I ONCE STOPPED AT A LITTLE CHEF VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I SAID
COULD I HAVE AN OMELETTE
WHILST IN A SLEEPING BAG
ROAD SAFETY ENTHUSIASTS PROOF THAT YOU CAN DO OTHER THINGS WHILE DRIVING
BUT THEN YOU CAN'T DRIVE
THEY ALWAYS SAY
I PARK IN THE UNDERGROUND CAR PARK
LIKE THE MASERATI
MERCEDES WILL PUT THEM BACK
WHICH PROBABLY EXPLAINS HOW HE WAS ABLE TO TRAVEL BACK IN TIME TO THE NINETEEN EIGHTY S AND STEAL PHIL OKI'S HAIR
I WAS CAPTAIN AT THE TIME
THE ONE THE ONE PLAYER THAT I PLAYED WITH
DOCTOR ISN'T SCARY IN THE WAY THAT THERE IS BLOOD AND GUTS AND PEOPLE GETTING BLOWN UP
COULD YOU JUST SAY
THAT WORKS OUT AT EIGHTY FIVE POUND A MILE
IF YOU ARE ME WITH MY VERY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR A CAR
JEREMY AND I WERE GENUINELY VERY SAD
ALTHOUGH WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY SURE WHY
IT DOESN'T HAVE REVERSE
IF THE COMPANYS GONE
AND THEN SHE WENT TO PARIS
PHONED ME UP THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND HE SAID
WHEN YOU TURN IT OVER
AS IMPLAUSIBLE AS IT MIGHT SOUND
AND I THINK WOULD HAVE COME OUT
UNTIL NEXT TIME
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
IT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING A BIT OF PROFIT
WE ARE VERY SIMILAR
THE EXPERTS HAVE GIVEN THEIR VERY BEST ADVICE
SO LET'S REMIND OURSELVES OF WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
I'M LIVING IN PRESTON
AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR
AH FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
PACK UP YOUR TRUNK
WHICH FOR A NOVELTY
YOU'RE ONLY MINUS FIVE
BUT I WANT TO SPEAK TO HER IN PRIVATE
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WERE RUNNING AWAY
I RISKED MY JOB FOR YOU
I GAVE YOU MONEY
WE'VE GOT HIGH VALUATIONS AND AUCTION TENSION
NOT TO MENTION SOME GREAT BRITISH ICONS
WE'LL BE FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT ONE RATHER GENEROUS ROYAL
IT'S GOT ALL THE INGREDIENTS OF A CLASSIC
AS A GENERAL RULE
THIS PLACE HAS HAD ITS FAIR SHARE OF JEOPARDY AND TENSION
TWICE THE CASTLE'S FUTURE HAS HUNG IN THE BALANCE
MORE RECENTLY IN NINETEEN FORTY NINE
CROMWELL REVOKED THE ORDER AND THE CASTLE WAS SPARED
SO HAVING BEEN FOUGHT OVER BY TWO OF THE MOST FAMOUS NAMES IN HISTORY
THE FAB FOUR WERE WONDERFUL ARTISTS IN THEIR DAY
BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THEM
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ANOTHER FINE AND RESPECTED ARTIST
THIS TIME AN AUTHOR WHO GREW UP AMONGST THE DIRT AND THEER OF THE NOTTINGHAM COAL MINING
TALKING ABOUT D H LAWRENCE
ALL THESE BUILDINGS COVERED IN A BLACK DUST AND HORS OF PEOPLE HEADING OFF DOWN THE STREET TO
AND THEN THIS PLACE
NUMBER EIGHT A VICTORIA STREET
AND THIS IS THE TYPICAL MINER'S COTTAGE OF THE DAY
IT'S A TWO UP TWO DOWN AND
THEY SAID WERE A CUT ABOVE THE REST
BECAUSE SHE GOT ALL OF THOSE KIDS EDUCATED
NONE OF THEM ENDED UP WORKING DOWN THE MINES
SHE LITERALLY LIFTED THE WHOLE FAMILY UP BY THEIR BOOT STRINGS
NOW BACK IN THE DAY
IN ONE OF HIS LATER LETTERS
HE DESCRIBED THE ROLLING LANDSCAPE AS
THE COUNTRY OF MY HEART
AND HE RETURNED TO THE THEME OF MINING AGAIN AND AGAIN IN HIS LETTERS
WRITINGS AND HIS MOST FAMOUS NOVEL
BACK UP AT OUR VALUATION DAY AT WALLASEY AND
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT
YOU TAKE THE BOYS HOME AND ENJOY THEM
IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE TO DUNSTER CASTLE AS WE HEAD OVER TO THE AER ROOMS FOR THE LAST TIME
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS
WE KNEW EACH OTHER
I NEED TO COME BACK ON THAT
WOULD YOU LIKE A LITTLE MORE MILK
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
I THINK YOU CAN WALK AROUND A FIELD AND GO HUNTING
AH CHRIS PAID TWENTY POUNDS UNDER A DEGREE OF PRESSURE
BUT I THINK THAT'S A REAL GOOD EYE FOR THE FUTURE
I GATHER THERE'S A MINI BERRY ON THE WAY
I DON'T HAVE TO
YOU'RE ON A ZERO HOURS CONTRACT
THERE WAS AN OLD TRAMP ASLEEP IN IT
HE REALLY RESPECTS YOU
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BREAK CHARACTER BUT
AND WE HAVE A CHRISTMAS CAKE
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL WE FOUND HIM
AND WE'LL BE FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT KENT'S ROLE DURING WORLD WAR II
AND VISITING THE HOME OF THE GREAT SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL
BUY SOMETHING THAT NOBODY ELSE WANTS AT THE TIME AND
WHICH MEANS IT'S GOING TO BE JAM PACKED INSIDE
WINSTON CHURCHILL STARTED PAINTING AT THE AGE OF FORTY
WHO CAME FROM KENT
CHURCHILL MAY HAVE SUFFERED FROM DEPRESSION
CONSORTIUM OF WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN BOUGHT THE HOUSE ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CHURCHILL AND
IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE TO OUR HOST LOCATION AS WE ARE OFF TO AUCTION FOR THE VERY LAST TIME TODAY
IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO ONE
CHECK OUR BBC WEBSITE OR YOUR LOCAL PRESS FOR MORE DETAILS
AND WHAT A LOVELY SURPRISE
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO MAKE A MISTAKE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
UM I CAME HERE TO TALK TO YOU
POLICE IN PORTUGAL ARE QUESTIONING ELEVEN PEOPLE ABOUT HER DISAPPEARANCE
OBSERVING THE INTERVIEWS
THAT'S ACCORDING TO A TOP LEVEL US GOVERNMENT REPORT
IT SAID THE CIA LIED ABOUT HOW BRUTAL THEY WERE
IT'S MY JOB TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND THEM
PRETTY BAD LUCK
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO EARTHQUAKE PRONE
AND IT WAS AMERICA'S PARANOIA WITH SECRET SOVIET NUCLEAR TESTING THAT HELPED TO PROVE
SO MY NEXT STORY'S NOT AN EARTHQUAKE SITE
IN A MATTER OF SECONDS
THE REASON IT WAS SO DEVASTATING IS BECAUSE
PEOPLE HAD ALWAYS LIVED IN MANMADE CAVES
MEXICO'S BEEN STRUCK BY MASSIVE EARTHQUAKES
THEY BELIEVE THAT IN ONE OF THE PLANET'S WORST EARTHQUAKE ZONES
BUT THERE'S ONE PLACE WHERE QUAKES CAN LAST FOR UP TO ONE HOUR
MY NEXT STORY COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT
IT'S ABOUT AN EARTHQUAKE FAULT THAT'S DESTROYED EMPIRES AND DEPOSED KINGS
BUT RATHER BECAUSE OF ITS EXTRAORDINARY POWERS OF
MY NEXT EARTHQUAKE IS THE MOST SURPRISING OF ALL
IT'S NOWHERE NEAR AN ACTIVE EARTHQUAKE ZONE
THE ONLY TROUBLE IS
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN
EVEN AFTER DECADES OF RESEARCH
BUT FOR SOME GEOLOGISTS
PREDICTION REMAINS THE HOLY GRAIL
AND OVER IN TURKEY
THERE'S ONE FAULT WHERE WE THINK WE CAN MAKE AN EARTHQUAKE FORECAST
IF YOU HAVE TWO GREAT MASSES OF ROCK
THEYRE NOT GOING TO MOVE VERY EASILY
IN AND IN THAT SENSE ALONE IT CAN CAUSE MORE DAMAGE
WE STILL CAN'T EVEN PREDICT THEM
THEY'RE IN AFGHANISTAN
AND NOT EXPECTING THAT
JUST TALKING TO RANDOM PEOPLE
AND BECAUSE YOU YOU GO THERE WITH SAY
FIND THE TALIBAN
WITH THE GUYS AND MYSELF
WHEN I HAD HIM AND I HANDED HIM OVER
LET ALONE THE BOYS
AS ONE OF MY MEN
I NEEDED TO DO AND I WANTED TO DO
THEY HAD THE TOOLS
AND HE WAS LIKE
YOU'RE A RETARD WITH A SHIT SHOT
HOW DID YOU HIT ME AND NOT THEM
BOTH BUTT CHEEKS WERE SPLIT OPEN
WHEN I LOOK BACK AT IT
IT'S NOT LIKE A MORTAR
IT LOOKS A BIT DODGY
SO WE STARTED TO DRIFT OFF TO THE RIGHT AND AT THAT POINT
WHERE WOULD YOU PUT IT IF YOU WERE THE ENEMY
THIS IS ACTUALLY AN IDEA MAKING SCHOOL FACTORY
THIS WILL FLY AT SEVENTY
I WILL ONLY BE ABOUT THIRTY MILES UP
THOUSAND FEET IS SPACE
IF YOU WALKED OUTSIDE INTO FIFTY
THOUSAND FEET WEARING NORMAL CLOTHES LIKE THESE
AND THAT IS WHY EVEN THOUGH THE SOVIETS STOLE A BIT OF A MARCH ON THE AMERICANS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
I'VE DONE ALL THE TRAINING A CIVILIAN CAN REALLY DO
I AM SLIGHTLY APPREHENSIVE
I'LL BE BRUTALLY HONEST WITH YOU I DON'T LIKE WEARING THE SPACESUIT
WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR TROUBLE
WE ARE LOOKING FOR TREASURE
WHICH I KNITTED VEGETABLES FOR
TAKE PHOTOS OF LANDSCAPE SHOTS AND QUITE CONCEPTUAL SHOTS AS WELL
AND THEY ONLY WANTED TO ASSOCIATE WITH OTHER RICH PEOPLE
YOU COULD BUY IT FOR SIXTY FIVE
CHRIS IS STAYING IN AUSTRALIA
WHEN WE WERE LEAVING
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS
I WANT MAXIMUM MONEY FOR THIS
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THOSE IN
A PIANO IN THE CORNER
THE QUEENS FERRY CROSSING
NOT FOR THE REASONS YOU'RE THINKING OF
THERE ARE OTHER REASONS
BACK IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW OFF THE BEST ANTIQUES WE'VE FOUND HERE SO FAR TODAY
IT'S AH IT'S A PERIOD BUILDING
THAT WILL BE COMPLETED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN
BUT WHY THREE BRIDGES
YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING
AND THE FOUNDATIONS ARE FILLED WITH TWENTY EIGHT
IT WAS IN THEIR HOUSE AND IT CAME DOWN TO MY DAD
THIS IS WHAT WE FIND
AND GOING UNDER THE HAMMER RIGHT NOW
WE HAVE THAT SEED PEARL NECKLACE
I THINK BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
WHATEVER THE SUBJECT MATTER
MOST PEOPLE GENERALLY
THERE ARE OTHER FAR WORSE PROBLEMS
ANSWER THE QUESTION
AND OF COURSE HE'S FINE
HE DOES REQUESTS
SO HE'S HAD TO GO BACK HOME
THAT HAS IT'S PLACE
LAST FOUR YEARS
THIS PLACE HAS SURVIVED THE DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERIES AND THE ENGLISH CIVIL WAR
BUT I'M SURE IT WILL
HOW THEY USED THE WEIGHTS AND THE MEASURES
PARTICULARLY THE SMALLER ONES
AND THEY DON'T MAKE BIG MONEY
AND WE MIGHT HAVE AH A LITTLE BIT OF A BIDDING WAR IN THE ROOM BUT
REALLY A COLLECTOR'S DREAM
WHERE DID YOU GET THESE SCALES FROM
AROUND THE TIME OF THE BLACK PLAGUE
WHEN THERE WASN'T ENOUGH LABOUR TO CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE CHURCH
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK
WE ARE SURROUNDED BY HISTORY
AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE SOME HISTORY OF OUR VERY OWN TODAY
SITUATED JUST OUTSIDE OF SIREN
THIS IS WHERE OUR LOTS ARE GOING UNDER THE HAMMER
LET'S GET INSIDE AND CATCH UP WITH OUR OWNERS AND GET THE SALE UNDER WAY
WHILE WERE IN THE AREA FILMING
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT THE CATHEDRAL'S JEWEL IN THE
AND FOR THE MOMENT
CARRIES ON THE ALL MALE TRADITION WITH THE MEN SINGING THE BASS
JUST SEVEN YEARS OLD
WELL IT'S NOT YOUR LEG
AND I WOULD EXPECT A WHOLE LOT MORE INTEREST FROM THE INTERNET ACTUALLY THROUGHOUT THE SALE
AND WE HAVE TODAY
A FEW MONTHS AGO
I DON'T WANT IT
WHETHER IT WAS YESTERDAY OR MONTHS AGO
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS
SUPERBUGS COULD KILL MORE PEOPLE THAN CANCER BY TWENTY FIFTY
RESEARCHERS WANT ACTION TO STOP TEN MILLION DEATHS A YEAR
WITH BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AND EDDIE REDMANE AMONG THE BRITISH STARS UP FOR AWARDS
THATS AMONG THE PM'S PLANS TO TACKLE CHILD ABUSE IN ENGLAND AND WALES
HE SAID PUBLIC SPENDING WOULD FALL SENSIBLY
BUILT LIKE A BRICK SHIT HOUSE
PULLS DOWN YOUR PANTS
ONE LADY JUSTED A GRAND PIANO
A SET OF SPOONS AND SOMEONE ELSE SAID LARRY GRAYSON
SHE DID SOUND LIKE AN IGNORANT BULGAR
WE'VE JUST HEARD THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES ARE STARTING TO FALL DRASTICALLY
FOR AN EXPLANATION
BUT IT'S MAINLY
WHERE OUR TEAMS
WHAT WOULD IT BE
IT'S WORTH A LOT OF MONEY
IF IT IS WHAT I THINK IT MIGHT BE AND IT DOES DATE FROM THAT PERIOD
I THINK IT'S A FAIR PRICE
IS IT ALL THERE
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS
AND THAT WILL BE THE DETERMINING FACTOR AS TO WHETHER THEY NEED THE BONUS BI OR NOT
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
AND WE KNOW IT'S A GREAT OBJECT
WE HAVE TO BE BRAVE
GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO HAVING A WORD WITH ROB
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT
WE NEED TO FIND SOME ANTIQUES AND COLLECTABLES ALL OF OUR OWN
WHO AM I TALKING ABOUT
ANY IDEAS WHAT WE CAN CALL TEDDY
THE MARKET FOR IVORY
TO EXPERIENCE AND STUDY FOREIGN CULTURES
CANALETTO QUICKLY FOUND SUCCESS
ESPECIALLY THE ENGLISH
BUT PAINTED POSTCARDS
ART LOVERS AND WRITERS FOR NEARLY
I'M STILL SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
EVERYBODY HAS THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THEMSELVES
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS
WE THINK IT'S GOT LEGS
IT'S ALL OVER FROM TRI MARKET AUCTION ROOMS AND WE HAVE SOME VERY HAPPY OWNERS
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED TODAY'S SHOW
WE WANT TO FLOG IT FOR YOU
BRING IT ALONG TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS
ALL THE INFORMATION WILL BE THERE
AND KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR LOCAL PRESS
THIS IS THE PROGRAMME THAT TESTS OUR CONTENDERS ON THREE LEVELS
WHAT THEY THINK THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY OUGHT TO KNOW AND WHAT THEY DO KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE CRUNCH
THE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE ROUND NOW
SO PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A CONTENDER IN THE NEXT SERIES
DO GO TO OUR WEBSITE BBC
THANKS FOR WATCHING
BECAUSE IT STOPS YOU MOPING ON ABOUT ALE
RIGHT HANDFUL SHE WAS
I'VE RUINED EVERYTHING
IT'S IN YOUR VENUE
WITH YOUR FRIENDS
WE'RE WEARING YOUR CLOTHES AND YOUR EVERYTHING ELSE
NO ONE CARES WHAT I THINK AND THE WHOLE THING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME
AND BERT AND TINA FROM THE CHIP SHOP
I IT WON'T BE FINE
WE HAVE ANOTHER HE ON FRIDAY
WE CAN'T GET IN HERE
BOTH A SENSE OF OF GLADNESS AND OF PANIC ENTERS YOUR HEART BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO BEFORE
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE
SAY ITS PRAYERS AROUND HIM
I'M NOT SURE WHAT MY SPECIFIC DUTIES ARE
IT'S MY FIRST YEAR
I WAS A BARRISTER
IT'S ONE OF THE MAIN ACCESS ROUTES IN AND OUT OF THE CATHEDRAL
SO IT MEANT THAT WE HAD TO SHUT THAT DOOR
ESPECIALLY WE WE GOT LETTERS TWICE
PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT REALLY YOU SHOULD DO NOTHING
RENEWED OR WHATEVER
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING
BEING A BIT MEAN
ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF DECEMBER
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO MAKE A MISTAKE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
I CAME HERE TO TALK TO YOU
I WANT TO BE THERE FOR THE KIDS
A FEW MONTHS AGO
WHETHER IT WAS YESTERDAY OR MONTHS AGO
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS
I YOU HEARD
BECAUSE IT STOPS YOU MOPING ON ABOUT ALE
CLIMB ON TOP OF YOU
I'VE RUINED EVERYTHING
OR KILLER WHALES
ONE HUNTING OFF THE CALIFORNIAN COAST
I GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THE BRONTES HOME
WHEN IT COMES TO VALUATION
BECAUSE THEY REALLY DESERVE IT
THIS IS THE GREAT THING ABOUT FLOING
SO HE REALLY WAS SELF TAUGHT
HE WENT TO WORK AS A JUNIOR IN A GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT
HE HAS BEEN THE ONLY OFFICIAL WARTIME POSTER ARTIST
HE DESIGNED A HUNDRED POSTERS FOR THE WAR OFFICE
A VERY PROLIFIC TIME IN GAMES' CAREER
AND IF YOU LOOK OUT THE WINDOWS AND YOU'
BRINGING ART TO THE MASSES
GROWING UP IN LONDON AND
THERE WAS A FEEL GOOD FACTOR GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY
GET OUT ON HOLIDAY
AND WE GREW UP WITH HIS WORK
AND WHEN HE DESIGNED A POSTER
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY
NOT A LOT OF MONEY BUT
THAT IS A GOOD RESULT
I'M SURROUNDED BY RED
AND LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
BUT WHAT'S NOT KNOWN IS HOW AWARE HE WAS OF HIS DAUGHTERS' LITERARY AMBITIONS
EVERY NIGHT AT NINE O'CLOCK
WITHIN TWO YEARS
AND SOON HER IDENTITY WOULD BECOME WIDELY KNOWN
PEOPLE WOULD COME FROM FAR AND WIDE JUST TO TRY AND CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HER
THEIR OBJECTS BECAME THE DESIRE OF FORTUNE HUNTERS
INCLUDING ONE OF THE MOST INFAMOUS VICTORIAN FORGERS OF ALL TIME
VERY TASTEFUL ONES
WHICH HELP PROTECT OUR LITERARY HERITAGE
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN A COUPLE OF DONKEYS
IT'S A ROLLER COASTER RIDE
SOMETHING FROM THE ORIENT HAS COME TO THE COR VALLEY
CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT IS
NOT UNDER FLOOR HEATING
BUT HE KNOWS I WOULDN'T WANT TO LEAVE
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR ONE
YOU ONCE A VERY BUSY WOMAN
YOU THINK THAT I
YOU MET A WOMAN ONE NIGHT
COULD SEE WHAT WAS JUST AROUND THE CORNER
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MORE SEDUCTIVE IDEA
THEIR EXPLORERS HAD MAPPED THE DARK HEART OF AFRICA
THEIR SCIENTISTS HAD UNLOCKED THE SECRETS OF EVOLUTION
SO PERHAPS IT WAS NO SURPRISE THAT THEY WERE CAPTIVATED BY THE STORY OF A PIONEER
IT'S LIKE THIS ULTIMATE HORSEY
WRITTEN IN THE REIGN OF QUEEN VICTORIA
WE FIND OURSELVES AMONG A GROUP OF EMINENT VICTORIANS
IT SEEMS VERY FIRMLY ROOTED IN THE WORLD OF GENTLEMEN'S CLUBS
RELAXING AFTER DINNER AT THE HOME OF A WELL KNOWN INVENTOR
AND AS THE EVENING WEARS ON
WE GET A NEW STAR AND THE SHOW IS BUILT AROUND A NEW STAR PERFORMANCE
THE MUSIC OF THE BEATLES
WANDERING THROUGH SPACE AND TIME IN
IT CAN MOVE ANYWHERE IN TIME AND SPACE
HE'S THE ONLY TIME TRAVELLER I CAN THINK OF WHO LIVES IN A TIME MACHINE
THIS IS THE CONSOLE OF THE VERY FIRST TARDIS
THE DOCTOR ACTUALLY LIVES IN ONE IT'S HIS HOME
HE ISN'T TRAVELLING FROM ONE TIME TO ANOTHER
PROBABLY THE BEST LOVED TIME MACHINE IN ALL SCIENCE FICTION
THE SERIES RAPIDLY EVOLVED INTO SOMETHING INFINITELY MORE EXCITING THE DEATH DEFYING
HE WASN'T A KIND OF JOCK
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT I'D END UP HERE EVENTUALLY
HE WASN'T THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE ROOM
HE WAS JUST CLEVERER THAN EVERYONE ELSE
BECAUSE OF HIS INTELLECT
I DID SEE SOME TOM BAKER EPISODES BUT
I FOUND HIM MUCH SCARIER THAN THE MONSTERS
BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE FLAT PACKED
EVER SINCE ITS FIRST APPEARANCE IN A BLACK AND WHITE SCRAPYARD IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
IT'S ALL OF NARNIA IN ONE BOX
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS
AND I DISCOVERED IN THE BASEMENT MY FATHER'S HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK
AND I WAS AMAZED
BECAUSE MARTY ISN'T A SWASHBUCKLING ADVENTURER EXPLORING THE FAR FUTURE
HE'S A BEWILDERED YOUNG MAN LOST IN THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
EVERY MOMENT IS A CRISIS MARTY
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD A TIME MACHINE INTO A CAR
THE APPEAL OF THE DELOREAN WAS RATHER LOST ON ME
THEN HOW CAN YOU BE BORN TO GO BACKWARDS IN TIME TO MEET YOUR GRANDPARENTS BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
I STILL DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT A FLUX CAPACITOR DOES
IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY PERFECT SENSE
TWENTY MINUTES TO SIT THERE WITH A BLACKBOARD AND EXPLAIN IN TERMS OF TIME LINES
THE CONCEPT THAT IF A BUTTERFLY BEATS ITS WINGS IN BRAZIL
IT CAN SET OFF A TORNADO IN TEXAS
SCIENTISTS AND WEATHER FORECASTERS STILL ARGUE ABOUT ITS VALIDITY
IT HAS BECOME AN IRRESISTIBLE AND OFTEN ENORMOUSLY ENJOYABLE NARRATIVE TRICK
AND SO WE HAD TO CHANGE THE CAR
SO THE DIRECTOR
WHAT IF WE MADE IT A PHONE BOOTH
IT WAS WELDED TO A HYDRAULIC
YOU THE IDEA OF TIME TRAVEL
I QUITE FANCY HAVING DINNER WITH OLIVER CROMWELL
THAT WAS THE MOST FUN
THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY COOL
AND THEN DRINKS WITH CLEOPATRA
IT FELT MORE LIKE A BOOK OF POLITICAL SATIRE
SO IT IS THAT IN THE BOOK
DICK WAS ONE OF SCIENCE FICTION'S GENUINE GREATS
BECAUSE PHILIP K
BUT MANY SCIENCE FICTION WRITERS HAD A RATHER STRONGER SENSE OF SCEPTICISM
YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE WONDERED JUST HOW FAR OFF BALLARD'S DYSTOPIAN FUTURE REALLY
AS WELL AS A MUCH GREATER GRASP OF REALITY
THINGS WERE OLD AND BEAT UP IN SOME PLACES
PARANOID VISION OF THE FUTURE STILL FEELS REMARKABLY PROPHETIC
HE WAS WRITING ABOUT STATE SURVEILLANCE
VIRTUAL REALITY AND THE DANGERS OF TECHNOLOGY NOT JUST YEARS BUT DECADES AGO
AS VERY YOUNG PEOPLE
WOULD YOU FIND BRUCE WILLIS CHANNELLING FRENCH EXISTENTIAL ANGST ABOUT A CHILD HAVING A
BRUCE WILLIS IS A BIT OF A TIME TRAVEL VETERAN
AND YOUNG MAN HAVING IT OUT AS A FATHER SON CONVERSATION
I'M GOING TO BE THE GUY WHO GETS TIME TRAVEL RIGHT
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT
WHAT IF A PERSON LIVED LONGER THAN ONE LIFETIME
ANY MOVIE CAN SHOW A PERSON LIVING ONE LIFETIME AND
TIME TRAVEL STORIES OFTEN HAVE THE SAME BASIC PREMISE THAT THROUGH THE POWER OF SCIENCE
EIGHTY YEARS OLD AND THEY'RE STILL ACTING LIKE A TEENAGE ADOLESCENT
THEY NEVER GOT IT
THEY NEVER GOT BEYOND IT
AND SO I WAS SAYING
FOR SOME PEOPLE
BUT WHAT IF THEY HAD ANOTHER LIFETIME AND ANOTHER ONE AFTER THAT
THEY JUST DID IT SO THAT IT WAS BETTER AND BETTER
TIME IS THE ONE THING THAT NONE OF US CAN EVER ESCAPE
THAT WAS SO AWFUL
THAT WAS SO TERRIBLE
THAT WAS THE WORST DAY OF HIS LIFE EVER
WAS THE SAME DAY THAT HE EXPERIENCED AT THE END
THE SAME DAY THAT IT WAS PRESENTED TO HIM THAT TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST DAYS OF HIS LIFE
ACTUALLY INHABITS THE BODY OF ANOTHER PERSON IN ANOTHER ERA
SAM ISN'T JUST WANDERING AROUND ANOTHER TIME
AND IN EACH EPISODE
HE HAS TO CORRECT A MISTAKE OR AN INJUSTICE BEFORE HE CAN MOVE ON FROM THE TIME IN WHICH HE'S
IN THE PREMISE OF THAT EPISODE
WRITERS WERE BEGINNING TO EXPLORE THE EMOTIONAL CONSEQUENCES
NOT JUST FOR THE TRAVELLER BUT FOR THOSE CLOSEST TO HIM
AND IT WAS IN THE NEWS ALL THE TIME
AT LEAST TO ITS FANS
AGAIN AND AGAIN
TIME CHEWS HIM UP AND SPITS HIM OUT
THIS IS TIME TRAVEL AS A STORY OF LOVE AND LOSS
WITH A CUP OF TEA
WAITING FOR SOMEBODY
BEING A COMPANION IN DOCTOR WHO MEANT SCREAMING
WEARING A MINI SKIRT AND ASKING
THE WRITERS WERE VERY KEEN TO SHOW THE DOCTOR AND HIS FRIENDS GRAPPLING NOT JUST WITH THE DALEKS
TIME TRAVEL IS THE MOST BEGUILING AND THE MOST POIGNANT SCIENCE FICTION CONCEPT OF THEM ALL
IMAGINE THAT ALL IT TOOK WAS TO PRESS THIS BUTTON
SHE'S A SPORTING LEGEND
THESE STREETS BECOME THE BACKDROP TO THE FINAL
IF YOU CLEAR YOUR PLATE OF SANDWICHES THEY KEEP BRINGING MORE SANDWICHES
TO BE VERY HONEST WITH YOURSELF
I STRUGGLED WITH SOME OF IT
I STRUGGLED WITH THE SORT OF THE BLIND FAITH THAT GOD IS A MAN AND THINGS LIKE THAT
BECAUSE IT HAD GONE BEYOND THE POINT OF ANYWHERE NEAR POLITE
I IT WOULD BE VERY EASY FOR YOUR PARENTS OR YOU TO SAY
THEY'VE BOTH PASSED AWAY NOW
UM I THINK MUM AND DAD HAD TO DEAL WITH AN AWFUL LOT WHEN I WAS BORN
THE ONLY WAY I COULD LIVE A NORMAL LIFE WOULD BE TO BE WEARING CALLLIPERS AND CRUTCHES
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T BE INDEPENDENT
THAT THEY WERE MAKING MY LIFE UNACCEPTABLE
THEY THEY DIDN'T SEE TANNI AS BEING DISABLED
KNOW I CRAWLED UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS LIKE
IT ACTUALLY MEANS AN AWFUL LOT AND
AND SO MANY GOOD SPORTSPEOPLE HAD BEEN THERE
AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO BE THERE AS WELL
AND AND SOME OF THE TRAINING SESSIONS WERE QUITE HARD GOING
I CAN'T DO THIS
SO I STARTED DOING A LOT MORE TRAINING ON THE ROAD
BECAUSE IT WAS ALL SO NEW AND WONDERFUL AND NOBODY HAD ANY EXPECTATION FOR WHAT I
I USED TO DO THE SAME FOR TANNI
I WANT TO DO THE LOT
LET ME DO THE TEN
I DON'T WANT YOU UNWELL
THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING APART FROM YOU WANTING TO BE THE BEST YOU CAN
I REMEMBER THINKING ON THE START LINE
AND I THINK HE MADE SOME KIND OF VERY DEROGATORY REMARK ABOUT YOU GOING TO THAT PE COLLEGE
FEAR OF WINNING
FEAR OF LOTS OF THINGS
I SHOULD RETIRE
BECAUSE OF THAT SUPPORT
WHICH I THINK MUST BE LOVELY IF IF THAT'S THE PEACE AND CALM THAT YOU GET FROM IT
IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING
IF IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE WAY PEOPLE ARE TREAT YOU
YOU CAN'T DO IT
HEADING IN THE SAME DIRECTIONS
HAD TO BE PLANNED IN AROUND OUR SCHEDULE SO
WE STAYED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED METRES FROM ONE OF THE FASTEST TRACKS IN THE WORLD AND WE STAYED ON THE
IT WASN'T A CHOICE
HE'D PUSH ME INTO THE PUDDLES
HE WOULD MAKE ME GO
BUT IN A SPRINT FINISH
BUT I THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE LET ME DO IT
IT KIND OF FELT THAT THE PARALYMPICS HAD
HAD GONE ON ANOTHER MASSIVE STEP FORWARD FROM FROM
WE BOUGHT HAIR DYE
IS THIS WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO
JUST SHOWS HOW STRONG OF A PERSON AND AN ATHLETE SHE REALLY IS
I STRUGGLE WITH THE CONCEPT OF OVERCOMING ADVERSITY
PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S IT'S WORDS USED AN AWFUL LOT AROUND DISABLED PEOPLE
UM AND THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES IN MY LIFE WHICH ARE REALLY CHALLENGING AND DIFFICULT AND HARD TO GET
THE MEDAL IS THE TANGIBLE BIT
LIFE HAS CHANGED
YOU'VE YOU'VE BECOME ONE OF UM
JUST READY FOR THE AWARDS
AND AS WE GOT OUT
AND SITTING IN THE CORNER UNDER CANDLELIGHT WERE CATHERINE AND MICHAEL
IN A USUAL WAY
ISN'T SHE WONDERFUL
WHEN YOU LOOK IN FROM THE OUTSIDE
YOU SEE THE REALLY NICE BITS
THE GLAMOROUS BITS OR
A LOT OF THE TIME I WAS COMPETING
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING NEXT YEAR THERE'S
WHETHER IT WAS DAWN FRASER
LIN WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE SAME AND I THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE NERVOUS
AND SOMEBODY CAME AND SAID
WOULD YOU LIKE A HAND
IF I SAY ANYTHING
I APPEAR TO HAVE A CHIP ON MY SHOULDER
THE WORLD HAS MOVED ON BUT
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE AND HOPEFULLY
YOUR OWN WORKLOAD
YOU DECIDE WHAT YOU BECOME INVOLVED IN
I WAS DOING IT FOR MYSELF AND BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE GOOD
IT IS ABOUT PROTECTING THE WHOLE OF SOCIETY
THERE STILL AN AWFUL LOT OF VERY LOW LEVEL DISCRIMINATION OUT THERE THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE EVERY
TIME THAT WE SPEND TOGETHER
WE WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME APART
CARIS HAS ALMOST LIKE
KIND OF CHRISTMAS IS WHERE WE
WE GET TO BE TOGETHER
IT'S PROBABLY THE ONE DAY OF THE YEAR THAT I DON'T REALLY LOOK AT MY PHONE OR KES JUST COMES AND
THAT KIND OF TIME WITH FAMILY THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU TREAT OTHER PEOPLE
AS WE KNOW ON BARGAIN HUNT
I TRIED TO GO TO COLLEGE
ON OUR ONE HOUR SPECIAL
TWENTY MINUTES LATER I ASKED HIM AGAIN
HE TOLD ME THE SAME NUMBER
I TAKE IT TO ITS LIMITATIONS
INSPIRED BY THE FRENCH
BUT LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT THEM ANYWAY
I'M SUPPORTING MY MAN
THE EXTRA BONUS BUY
AND THAT COULD BE A WINNING SCORE BUT
THAT IS MINUS SEVENTEEN POUND
WHICH MEANS OVERALL
YOU ARE PLUS TWO
IT'S GOING TO COME UP FIRST
EVENTS CAN TAKE A VERY UNEXPECTED TURN
BELIEVE IT OR NOT
THOUSAND GRANDPARENTS AND FAMILY CARERS IN THE UK
RAISING NEARLY THREE HUNDRED
WHEN I LOST MY DAUGHTER CAREN TO BREAST CANCER
BUT THERE IS A CHARITY THAT CAN HELP GRANDPARENTS PLUS
THEY ADVISE AND SUPPORT GRANDPARENTS AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WHEN THEY TAKE ON THE CARING ROLE IN
I FELT A REAL RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR HER TWO LITTLE BOYS IN ANY WAY I COULD
AND FOR A FEW MONTHS AFTER SHE DIED THEY LIVED WITH ME
DEPRESSION AND ISOLATION
BUT SOME OF US GRANDPARENTS CAN SUDDENLY FIND OURSELVES LATER ON IN LIFE HAVING TO STEP IN AND
WHAT'S BEING DONE TO TACKLE THIS WAVE OF HERITAGE CRIME
MUCH OF WILSON'S WORK IS SAFELY STORED IN MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
BUT THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID FOR OTHER VALUABLE PARTS OF OUR RURAL HERITAGE
MAKE IT AS IT WAS BEFORE
IT'S AN INTRUSION ON SOMETHING VERY PERSONAL
IT WAS WORTH HALF A MILLION POUNDS NOT THAT THE THIEVES KNEW THAT
THEY SOLD IT FOR SCRAP FOR FORTY SIX POUNDS
THEN DON'T IGNORE IT
VISITING THEIR LOCAL MUSEUMS
KNOWING WHERE METAL DETECTORS MIGHT BE OPERATING
IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
DOG BECAUSE THERE'S PLENTY OF DOGS IN THE UK ALREADY
WE DON'T NEED TO BREED
AND ACTUALLY SAW AND HELD MY FIRST DORMOUSE
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT AN UPSET PUPIL
GET YOUR SKATES ON
THE WHOLE COUNTRYFILE FAMILY WILL BE IN BATH
I NOT ONLY ADMIT THEM
BUT THE DOCTOR NATURALLY FEELS THAT YOU SHOULD
FROM THEIR FORTIFIED PALACES
THEY'VE LIVED HERE FOR SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
WHEN THEY ELECTED MARTIN DE
IT TOOK THE PATRONAGE OF MANY POPES
THE WORK OF THE GREATEST ARTISTS THAT HAVE EVER LIVED
AND INCALCULABLE SUMS OF MONEY
HIS VICTIMS WERE FOUND FLOATING IN THE TIBER EVERY MORNING
BUT TO MACHIAVELLI
THEN WENT AROUND ON THEIR HANDS AND KNEES
AND HE HIMSELF WOULD BE ITS JULIUS CAESAR
TORMENTED BY HIS ARTISTIC RIVALRIES
HIS RELIGIOUS DOUBTS
AND HIS OWN HOMOSEXUALITY
AND ST PETER HIMSELF
BUT THEY WERE SOON SPENT AND THE CHURCH NEEDED MUCH
HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE MEDICI BANKING FAMILY
AND IN DECEMBER FIFTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
THEY SAID THAT IF THEY DIDN'T GET THEIR MONEY
EVEN BY THE POPE HIMSELF
ROME WAS BEING PUNISHED FOR ITS SINS
AH ONE THING WAS CLEAR
HE WAS DISGUSTED BY THE NAKED PRIVATE PARTS OF THE RENAISSANCE MASTERPIECES
THIS IS THE CHURCH OF SAINT IGNACIO
IMPULSIVE AND EMOTIONAL
WHEN HE FOUND HIS MISTRESS WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH HIS BROTHER
IF I READ OUT HER OWN WORDS AND YOU SEE THE SCULPTURE THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT
I THINK THERE'S LITTLE AMBIGUITY AS TO WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING AND
PEOPLE EXPECTED AT THE TIME
THE DREAM OF MY YOUNG YEARS
NEPHEW OF THE GREAT NAPOLEON BONAPARTE
THEY BOMBARDED ROME AND
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SECRETS OF ROME
ARRIVED AND UNITED ROME WITH THE REST OF ITALY
I'M STANDING IN THE REPUBLIC OF ITALY
WHICH FORMS THE BACKDROP TO THE PILLARS
WHICH MEANS THE LIGHT COMES FROM HOT
I SEE MY FIELDS THE STUDY OF MATTER AND THE WAY IN WHICH IT CAN BE TRANSFORMED
WE LOOK AT THE WAY ATOMS COME TOGETHER TO FORM MOLECULES AND THE WAY IN WHICH THOSE MOLECULES
WE ACTUALLY TOOK THIS REACTION AND PUT IT ON ICE
BUT THEN EMIT LIGHT
WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE MOLECULES BY OBSERVING THE LIGHT THAT THEY EMIT
WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE THAT YOU KNOW FROM THE ATOMS THAT WE'VE GOT TO START WITH
OXYGEN FROM THE AIR
AND IT'S VERY COLD SO THEY DON'T HIT EACH OTHER VERY HARD
THEY CAN FALL APART VERY EASILY
WE NEED SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY BRING THE H ATOMS TOGETHER
WITHOUT THE DUST GRAIN
THE ATOMS WOULDN'T REALLY ENCOUNTER EACH OTHER FOR LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE H TWO
SO IT'S VITAL IN BRINGING THEM TOGETHER AND MAKING THE REACTION HAPPEN
THERE'S AN ENORMOUS NUMBER
LONG CARBON CHAINS
WHERE YOU DON'T COLLIDE VERY OFTEN
HAS BEEN A REAL CHALLENGE
AND A LOT OF THE MOLECULES ARE FORMED BY UNUSUAL GAS PHASE CHEMISTRY
BUT FOR MANY OF THEM WATER
THEN THE ATOMS AND MOLECULES IN THIS GAS WILL START MOVING FASTER AND FASTER AS THE
BECAUSE THE MOLECULES ALLOW THE GAS TO COOL
WHAT DO WE KNOW
BECAUSE DUE TO THE INITIAL MASS OF THE CLOUD
YOU SHOULD STOP GRAVITY
WE LOOKED AT VARIOUS PICTURES OF IT TAKEN MANY YEARS APART
NEBULAE ARE DIFFUSE
YOU NEED TO GET TO A SITE WHICH IS REALLY
REALLY DARK AND DOESN'T SUFFER FROM TOO MUCH LIGHT POLLUTION
IT'S POSSIBLE TO SEE
BUT IF YOU'RE USING A FIXED PLATFORM LIKE THIS TRIPOD
BUT THE LONGER YOU LOOK
AH LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE ORION NEBULA
THIS IS A SHORTER EXPOSURE AND UNDER SOME CLOUDY SKY
USING A TELESCOPE SYSTEM IN ARIZONA
IT CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS A SUPERNOVA
ABOUT TWICE A MILLENNIUM
IT CAN DRAW GAS FROM THE BINARY PARTNER UNTIL IT REACHES A CRITICAL LIMIT AT WHICH THE
SO WE HAVE AN EXPANDING ENVELOPE OF HOT GAS
THE OUTER LAYERS OF WHICH ARE MOVING AT
VERY RAPID EXPANSION
SO IN THIS EXAMPLE HERE WE HAVE A SUPERNOVA REMNANT
WHAT IT MAY WELL DO IS
AND SO SUPERNOVAE
LIKE THE ONE IN MESSIER EIGHTY TWO
WILL PRODUCE NEW ELEMENTS AND DUST GRAINS AS WELL
THE ON BOARD CHEMICAL ANALYZEERS ON THE FIELD
THIS IS REALLY EXCITING
WE SORT OF EXPECTED TO SEE SOMETHING THERE
YOUR CARRIAGE AWAITS
SO LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
MY WONDERFUL HUSBAND DOES SOMETHING FANTASTIC FOR ME EVERY TEN YEARS AND FOR MY SIXTIETH BIRTHDAY
HE WROTE TO SIXTY PEOPLE
WHEN IT COMES TO BUYING THESE ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES OUT HERE TODAY
EIGHTEEN MINUTES DOWN
TWO BITS BOUGHT
THIS IS WHAT I FIND BIZARRE ABOUT THIS JOB
YOU'LL HAVE SOME SUPER DUPER BIT OF FIBRE OPTIC WHICH WILL BE INSERTED INTO YOUR ORIFICE
THEY DID IT WITH BITS OF KIT LIKE THIS AND THEREFORE
WE'D BETTER SMARTLY FIND OUT WHAT THE BLUE TEAM BOUGHT
WAS THAT PREDICTED OR WAS IT PREDICTED
THAT'S A GOOD START
LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT
I'M HOPING TO FIND A PLACEMENT WHERE THEY SPECIALISE IN THAT
WITH YOUR SUPPORT
NOW WHERE WAS I
I'M UP AGAINST IT
THIS TIME HE ONLY NIPPED DOWN THE POST OFFICE TO GET HIS BENEFIT
YOU'RE NOT GOING AHEAD
THEY'RE WATCHING THE DOCUMENTARY
WHEN I HAD MY HEAD INJURY
IT'S EASY TO THINK WE KNOW THIS STORY
THE MORE MOVING AND THE GRANDER IT REALLY
NOT THE NEWSPAPERS
NOT STALIN IN MOSCOW
A MODEST LITTLE MAN WITH MUCH TO BE MODEST ABOUT
IT WAS TO HOLD A LEADERSHIP ELECTION
KEYNES WAS FURIOUS BUT
AND RATIONING GOES ON AND ON
RIGHT THE WAY DOWN TO NEARLY AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE
OUTSIDE THE HOUSES
CROWDS FORMED HUMAN CHAINS TO PASS FOOD AND CIGARETTES AND CHOCOLATE AND
THE PRESS WAS BROADLY SYMPATHETIC
BUBBLING UP DEMAND FOR THE GOOD LIFE ON THE OTHER
BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAR HE SAID
BUT HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY DO IT
SURELY THERE MUST BE SOME PLAN
PILED HIGH WITH CHAIRS
FOREIGN OFFICE OFFICIALS TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THE FRENCH PLAN
THE GOVERNMENT WAS IN CHAOS
WAS SEEN CHARGING AROUND WESTMINSTER
HIGH ON BENZEDRE AND COVERED IN BOILS
ESTABLISHED SOON AFTERWARDS
BUT PERHAPS WE HAD NO CHOICE
THE AMERICAN ALLIANCE OR THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
WHILE SOBERLY SURVEYING OUR GREAT PAST AND OUR PROMISING FUTURE
A FINAL SURPRISE FROM THE OLD MAN
FOR A SHORT PERIOD
PREPARING FOR WAR
MANY PEOPLE IN BRITAIN KNEW JUST HOW HE FELT
NOW THAT'S GOT TO BE WORTH INVESTING IN
EACH WITH THEIR OWN UNIQUE STORY THAT RELATES TO A DIFFERENT PERIOD IN HISTORY
LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
WE'LL BE FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT THE COLLECTION
ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE COLLECTIONS HAS TO BE THESE VERY RARE LEATHER WALL HANGINGS
WE NEED SOME STUNNING AUCTION RESULTS
IF YOU ARE BUYING OR SELLING AT AUCTION
THERE IS COMMISSION TO PAY
IT VARIES FROM SALE ROOM TO SALE ROOM AND THEN THERE'S V TO PAY ON TOP OF THAT
IT'S A REALLY HARD THING TO VALUE ISN'T
PEOPLE BUY INTO THAT WINDOW OF THE PAST AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE SHOW
IT'S GOING UNDER THE HAMMER
BUT THERE ARE THOSE WHO MAKE IT THEIR LIFE'S WORK
AND DURING HIS LIFETIME
HE MASTER COLLECTION OF OVER TWENTY
ALL OF WHICH CAN BE ENJOYED BY EVERYONE THANKS TO HIS PUBLIC MINDED PRINCIPLES
IT'S ALL DOWN TO ONE MAN
HE STARTED BUYING FOR PLEASURE
HOWEVER HE WAS NO ART CONNOISSEUR
SO HE STUCK TO SAFE GROUND
ONCE ONE IS DISCOVERED
SHE REALLY DOES DESERVE A MEDAL
CHECK THE LINKS
HE'S CHARLIE'S DAD
THE WAY THOSE ALARMS WERE WAILING
YOU'VE NEVER MESSED UP
I KNOW I'VE GOT NO RIGHT TO ASK BUT DOT NEVER WOULD
SHE NEEDS THIS AS MUCH AS THE REST OF US
BUT A PART OF THAT NARRATIVE IS
SO IT JUST BASICALLY JUST SHOWS THAT
YOU END UP ON THE STREET
THIS IS A BEAUTIFULLY WARM HALL
SO IT'S REALLY NICE
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE
THERE WAS A SENSE THAT
AND THE THE BACK DOOR
NOBODY ELSE WILL
THE VISITORS WON'T COME IF WE DON'T LOOK AFTER THE FABRIC
AND NOW BECAUSE OF THAT
THE FOOD BANKS ARE MAINLY RUN BY THE CHURCHES
THAT PEOPLE TREAT PEOPLE AS
THEY RING US TODAY
I THINK WE MADE A
WE'RE PREDICTING A DECENT PROFIT ON THAT
WHICH MAY SAVE THEIR BACON
KERRY AND TERRY
YOU WON'T OPEN THEM TILL I TELL YOU
THAT'S MINUS FIFTY FIVE
IT'S GREAT THAT YOU'RE BOTH DOING IT
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID WHAT I SAID BEFORE
WAS CONFRONTED BY THE IMPERTINENT
WHENEVER HE TRAVELLED BY TRAIN
PEOPLE WERE MAD FOR HIM
THE FEW MINISTERS WHO KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON
AND SO THE REST OF THE CABINET
OUR AMBASSADORS AROUND THE WORLD
EVEN THE ARMED FORCES WERE AFFECTED
BUT MANY REFUSED TO TURN UP
THE FALLEN BRITISH HERO
ETON BEING THE MOST POPULAR

WHEN THE MINI HAD BECOME A NATIONAL ICON
LIKE MANY EDWARDIAN GENTS
HE WAS BASICALLY SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THE WORKING CLASSES AND HE WANTED TO AVOID CONFRONTATION WITH

LACKING HOUSING AND LACKING OPPORTUNITIES
THE WHOLE SCENE WAS A LIVING INSULT

BRITAIN EXPERIENCED HER FIRST RACE
FIRST THERE WERE SCORES

EACH OF THEM CARRIED SIXTEEN MISSILES
MACMILLAN POINTED OUT
IN A PRIVATE LETTER TO EISENHOWER HE WROTE
ONE OF THE CANOEISTS MANAGED TO GRAB HOLD OF THE BOWS OF THE AMERICAN SUPPORT SHIP AND WAS
HAVING SORTED OUT DE GAULLE'S BLOOD SITUATION
TO WHOM I COULD GIVE NOTHING
THAT I WANTED TO PUT A HAND ON HIS SHOULDER AND TELL HIM
IMAGINE THE EDIT PF SONG
REPORTED BACK TO HIS CABINET
ALMOST EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS STORY FROM THE ARROGANT ESTABLISHMENT CLIQUES
CHALLENGED BY CHIPPY OUTSIDERS
AND THE NUCLEAR OBSESSION
WARD FANCIED HIMSELF AS A BIT OF A LEFTY AND SO
THE RUMOURS ABOUT PERFUMO WERE RAISED IN THE COMMONS
THE PANICKING MINISTER WAS HAULED IN BY THE GOVERNMENT WHIPS AT THREE IN THE MORNING AND
IN A PREPARED STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
THE PERFUMO AFFAIR HAD AROUSED SUCH NATIONAL INTEREST THAT IT MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE TIPPED THE

I COULD GO OFF MY TROLLEY
RESTORATION AIN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TRAMS
CURATOR OF THIS MARVELLOUS PLACE
WE FIND OURSELVES IN ETWALL IN DERBYSHIRE
THIS IS A REALLY BRAINY LOT
IT COULD BE A WINNING SCORE
BY REFUSING TO COOPERATE NOW IS ONLY GOING TO MAKE THINGS A WHOLE LOT WORSE FOR YOURSELF WHEN IT
A CASTLE THAT'S DOMINATED THE LANDSCAPE EVER SINCE THE MIDDLE AGES
IF YOU RELISH DISCOVERING THE CHRONICLES OF DAYS GONE BY
BENEFITS FROM A BIT OF LITERATURE

WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THEM
THAT POCKET WATCH ENDED UP SELLING FOR A RATHER LOVELY PRICE
BUT DON'T GET TOO ENGROSSED
BECAUSE YOU JUST MIGHT MISS YOUR ITEM

THERE IS COMMISSION TO PAY
AND THE RATES VARY FROM ROOM TO ROOM

BUT I LOVE THAT
YOU'RE A HAPPY BUNNY
I HAVE GOOD NEWS
NOW THAT HE'S BEING REPRESENTED BY A WHITE MANU
WHAT IF WE DID HAVE A BLACK FATHER CHRISTMAS
DURING THEIR TIME IN RESIDENCE
THOUSAND DIFFERENT OBJECTS
OBJECTS WHICH TELL A STORY OF LOVE AND POLITICAL INTRIGUE
A GUY SAID TO HIM
AND YOU'RE ALL ON TV RIGHT NOW
EVERYBODY IS SO EXCITED
THINGS HAD MOVED ON
THIS SEEMS A LITTLE BIT OBSOLETE
JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING'S COVERED
IF YOU ARE BUYING OR SELLING IN AN AUCTION ROOM THERE'S ALSO COMMISSION TO PAY
AND WE HAVE AN ITEM WHICH PIONEERED THE HOME SOUND SYSTEM
IT JUST GETS SKY HIGH
AH THANKS TO THE ENGLISH CIVIL WAR
ALTHOUGH HE FAILED
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME BECAUSE I WANT TO STAY UP HERE FOR
FOR A LONG TIME
THE BED WAS STILL LEFT IN ITS PACKING CASES AND THAT'S WHERE IT REMAINED FOR THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED YEARS
UNTIL THE NATIONAL TRUST TOOK OVER THE HOUSE
LOOKED INSIDE THESE PACKING CASES AND DISCOVERED THIS BED
IT WAS A WAY OF ACQUIRING LAND OR A TITLE
AND IT QUITE CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THEIR SON WAS DESPERATELY IN LOVE
THEY REALLY DID LOVE EACH OTHER
AND AMONGST ALL EVERYTHING
WE CAN DISCOUNT THIS ONE MORE OR LESS STRAIGHT AWAY
AH WE REALLY DO NEED TO REEL IN THE BIDDERS
WHO'S RIGHT NEXT TO ME
AND WHAT YOU PLAN TO DO
BRING YOUR ITEMS ALONG TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS
THERE MUST BE A WAY OUT
I AM CATEGORICAL
WE ARE DESPERATE

THE INTERVIEW IS ABOUT KILLING NORTH KOREA'S LEADER
COUNCILS ACROSS ENGLAND HAVE WARNED THEY'RE BEING PUSHED CLOSE TO BREAKING POINT
IT'S BECAUSE THE MONEY THEY GET FROM GOVERNMENT IS TO BE CUT AGAIN
PLEASE DON'T LET ME DIE
UM JUST TO GIVE HER A BIT OF A BREAK
HE KNOWS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS HE CAN AND CAN'T DO AND THE THINGS HE CAN'T DO
THANKS FOR HELP
AH SINCE HE'S BEEN BORN
WHO'S FACED AN UPHILL BATTLE OF FOURTEEN YEARS
THANK YOU FOR YOUR WONDERFUL WORK
SHE'S A VERY RUDE WOMAN
I NEED TO TRANSFER THE MONEY NOW SO THAT I CAN PAY RED
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT
THEY ALL KEEP ME BUSY
DON'T LOOK AT ME
I HOPE YOU SPEND A LOT
SOME OF WHICH ARE OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE
ALMOST AS INCREDIBLE AS THE PROFITS THAT OUR TEAMS ARE ABOUT TO ACHIEVE
HE'S GONE OUT AND FOLLOWED A TRADITIONAL FORM HERE
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF GOOD PUT ONES IN OUR SALE SO
YOU ARE NOT KIDS ANYMORE
I THOUGHT HE WAS DOING IT FOR ME
GETS THE SAME TRAIN TO AND FROM WORK
COMES HOME AT A REASONABLE HOUR
SOMEONE NINE TO FIVE
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WAS
I'M NOT WILD ABOUT IT
AND I'M HAVING CANDLES
AND I'VE READ ALL THE BOOKS
I'VE GOT TO GET THE BIRTHING POOL READY AND THE MUSIC
I'M REALLY SORRY
THANK YOU SO MUCH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DO WITHOUT YOU
YOU'RE THE BEST
WHICH ARE WONDERFUL HYMNS
AND AS WE CAME OUT OF THE CATHEDRAL AT THE END
AND ALSO PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS OF US
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER
TWO OR THREE DAYS LATER
WHY IS THAT VIEW RIGHT IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA OF THE WORLD
IT'S DIFFERENT FOR BECAUSE I AM AN ORDAINED WOMAN
AND IN THE OTHER PART OF THE COMMUNION
IF A WOMAN SHOULDN'T BE IN AUTHORITY
NOT MESSING ABOUT
IT'S GOING GOOD
HE'S CHARLIE'S DAD
BECAUSE FROM NOW ON
THE WAY THOSE ALARMS WERE WAILING
YOU'VE NEVER MESSED UP
BUT DOT NEVER WOULD
SHE NEEDS THIS AS MUCH AS THE REST OF US
WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS
BUT IF I'M LOCKED UP IN THAT ROOM WHEN HE KICKS OFF
FOR GOODNESS' SAKE
IF YOU DO NOT VACATE THE PROPERTY
THERE MUST BE A WAY OUT
WE ARE DESPERATE
I THOUGHT HE WAS DOING IT FOR ME
GETS THE SAME TRAIN TO AND FROM WORK
COMES HOME AT A REASONABLE HOUR
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WAS
SO I SPEND ALL MY TIME WITH MY ANIMALS
AND THEN AT THE VERY FRONT OF THE SHOP
WE HAVE CLOTHES AND SHOES AND ALL
I'VE DONE IT FOR THIRTY YEARS
YEAH I SORT OF ENDED UP DOING THE CLOTHES AND ALL THE BITS AND BOBS
MAY WE JUST TALK TO YOU
BECAUSE IF ITS IF IT IS A COMB AND
YOU'D BETTER SHOVE OFF AND GO FOR IT
NOT A VAST AMOUNT OF CASH
IF YOU'D PLEASE BRING EM BACK TO ME
THAT WOULD BE GREAT
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A SQUINT AT HOW COLIN YOUNG
IS GETTING ON BUYING HIS BONUS BUYS
I'M GOING TO SHOVE OFF RIGHT NOW TO LONDON TO THE MUSEUM OF CHILDHOOD
AND SEE WHAT I CAN FIND
SHAPED AND THEN PAINTED
SO LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK
YOU ALSO HAVE TIM'S TON
THAT HAS TO BE THE CHEAPEST SILVER THIS SIDE OF NEWCASTLE
YOU'RE MINUS ONE FIVE FIVE
IS OUR DESTINATION
THAT'S BECAUSE EACH LATER GENERATION OF THE FAMILY WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE UPDATED THE PROPERTY
AND SUCH A WELL TO DO FAMILY COULD ONLY CALL UPON THE BEST
THE ARCHITECT HE COMMISSIONED WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR DESIGNING THE HOUSES OF
BECAUSE IT IS RATHER DARK DUE TO THE WONDERFUL ELIZABETHAN
BARRY DESIGNED THIS RENAISSANCE STYLE WOODEN SCREEN INSTEAD OF HAVING A SOLID WALL OR A DOOR PUT
THIS FABULOUS EMBROIDERY USED TO DECORATE THE BED
SO I FEEL LIKE I'VE DISCOVERED A BIT OF OUR HIDDEN HERITAGE
THEY'VE ADDED THEIR INNOVATIONS BUT KEPT TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL ELIZABETHAN DESIGN
IF YOU'RE BUYING OR SELLING AT AUCTION YOU HAVE TO PAY THE AUCTIONEER'S COMMISSION
THEY WERE DESCRIBED AS ROMANTIC
THEY DID LOOK FABULOUS
BUT THERE WAS NO REAL SENSE OF PURPOSE
MANY OF THEM LOOKED LIKE OLD CASTLES
FOUR PIECES OF SCULPTURE WERE COMMISSIONED TO MAKE THEIR MARK ON THE LOCAL LANDSCAPE
TRANSFORMATION IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE DESIGN
I'M ON A FORMER LANDFILL SITE NEAR ROSENDALE
WHICH HAS BEEN RECLAIMED AND REGENERATED FOR THE LOCAL PEOPLE AND WALKERS ALIKE TO USE
ISN'T THAT STRIKING
IT'S CALLED HALO
A WEEKEND AWAY WITH MY HUSBAND
PEOPLE KEEP PILING THROUGH THOSE DOORS
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT ADAM PARTRIDGE HAS BEEN UP TO
I REMEMBER IT SO WELL BECAUSE IT WAS SO FUNNY
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT
UM HOPEFULLY THIS LITTLE BIRD WILL FLY AWAY
ANY FURTHER BIDS
WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY WITH THAT
THAT WAS NO PROBLEM
QUITE WITHOUT INCIDENT
WITHOUT IT EVER BEING MADE A POINT OF HIS PERFORMANCE
WHICH IS QUITE A
NOBODY EVER ASKED ME TO DO ANYTHING SO
HATSIE WAS A VERY BRIGHT PERSONALITY
BECAUSE PAT WAS SO BIG
BUT HE'D BE IN FOR HALF A DAY SOMETIMES
IN LITERALLY A CAMEO
JOHN WAS STILL A JOBBING ACTOR AND GETTING HIS FEET BACK ON THE RUNG
YOU AND GET SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY POUNDS
BECAUSE HE'D BEEN AWAY THROUGH THE WAR
HE'D MADE A COUPLE OF MOVIES
AND WE LOVED THAT
HE DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE
AS HE WOULDN'T ANY DOMESTIC THING
AS A CONSEQUENCE
IT WAS ACTUALLY KINDNESS
HE'D PROPOSED MARRIAGE TO ME QUITE SOME TIME BEFORE IN A PLACE CALLED
TALKING ABOUT HATSIE AND THE THE AFFAIR
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
AND THAT WAS A PROPOSAL
THAT WAS HIM PROPOSING MARRIAGE
YOU'VE GOT TO GRAB THIS ONE
CERTAINLY THE OTHER
AND WHEN I MET TONY
HE KNEW WHAT REAL LOVE WAS
A PASSING THING
THAT WASN'T REALLY BEING IN LOVE
AND THAT WAS JOHN
AND HE DIDN'T BACK THE SERIES
IN SHABBY OLD UNIFORMS
VERY GOOD JOHN LEMEIER WAS
TO HAVE A GENT PLAYING THE SERGEANT
ALL HIS LITTLE IDIOSYNCRASIES
BUT ACTUALLY I THINK HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING
HE WASN'T FOOLING ME FOR A SECOND
THAT WAS THE GREAT THING ABOUT HIM
I LOVE THIS MAN
BUT THERE WAS AN ENERGY
AROUND EVERYONE ELSE WHEN HE WAS THERE
PEOPLE WILL FORGET
THIS IS HARD WORK
HAPPY TO BE TO BE WORKING
RATHER THAN BEING GUSHY
HE WOULD PAT YOU ON THE SHOULDER VERY GENTLY AND SAY
MY LITTLE FRIEND
BUT HE FELT IT VERY IN VERY DEEPLY
SOMETHING AND I WAS GOING SLIGHTLY OFF THE RAILS AT THE TIME
BEING IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS
MY MOTHER WAS VERY VERY WORRIED ABOUT ME AT THE TIME AND
IT WAS VERY FUNNY BECAUSE HE REALLY REALLY WASN'T GOOD AT THAT SORT OF THING
YOUR MOTHER'S VERY VERY WORRIED ABOUT YOUR LIFESTYLE
AND YOU'RE GOING TO CARRY ON DOING EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING BUT
JUST FOR MY SAKE
COULD YOU SORT OF GO ALONG WITH IT
AND JUST PRETEND THAT YOU ARE LIKE YOU KNOW MENDING YOUR WAY
WELL I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CAR
THINGS WENT WELL
JOHN SITTING ON A JURY AND
AND HE WROTE BACK A LETTER SAYING
I'M ENTIRELY UNSUITED TO THIS LINE OF WORK OWING TO THE FACT THAT I'M PRONE TO BO UM
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM
AND JOHN JUST SAT ON THE STAIRS
GREY HAIRED OLD A WHITE JACKET
THAT'S WHAT GOT HIM
PLAYING THE PIANO RATHER BADLY
DO YOU WANT TO JOIN
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK
AND AS JOANIE SAID
WHO MADE SO MANY LAUGH
REFUSED EVEN TO TAKE THE PROSPECT OF HIS DEATH SERIOUSLY
AND HE'D ALREADY WRITTEN HIS OWN OBITUARY FOR THE TIMES
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT IT
FOR YOUR ADDITIONAL VIEWING PLEASURE
AND THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS THAT IS TO MAKE SURE THERE IS AS MANY WORKING BIKES AS POSSIBLE
SO I DO A SESSION
ONE OF THOSE INCENTIVES IS THAT IF THEIR BICYCLE HAPPENS TO BE AT SCHOOL THAT DAY
AND FOR THE REDS
HAVE PARTED WITH MY CASH
A PIECE OF SILVER WHICH IS HALLMARKED OR A PAINTING WHICH IS SIGNED
THIS TEAM ARE GOING TO DO JOLLY WELL
BOLD ESTIMATE ON IT
YOU ARE VINDICATED
YOUR PICK WAS RIGHT
THEY WALK AWAY WITH A TWENTY TWO PO PROFIT
LET'S NOT BE GLOOMY ABOUT THIS
IT'S A GREAT SHAME
ON THIS PROGRAMME
IT MEANS THERE'S A PROFIT GOING TO CHARITY
WHICH I HAVE ABOUT MY PERSON YEAH
MEAN WHAT A SIGHT ALL LINED UP
I THINK IT WAS THE CROP SPRAYER
ONE OF MY STUDENTS
HE'S ABOUT TO TAKE HIS FIRST FLIGHT
IT'S THAT LONG JOURNEY
THAT'S NOT THE POINT
THIS IS A VITAL STAGE IN HER LIFE
IN PARTS OF INDIA
I THINK I'D JUST LEAN BACK
TAKE A DEEP BREATH
WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR FIRST TRAINING FLIGHT
I WANT TO RUN THAT PLACE IN A PROPER FAMILY WAY
NOW I'M IN THE FAMILY WAY
APPLES OR ONIONS
I'M JESSICA'S FATHER
WE'VE ALREADY HAD A GOOD LOOK AROUND THE AIRFIELD
MADE SOME FRIENDS
I COULD'VE GOT MY SCHOOL LEAVING CERTIFICATE
I ALWAYS SAY YOU NEED JUST TWO THINGS TO FLY
FOR THE JUMPING
A BIG ONE FOR A SPENCER
CLEAR TAXI FOR HOLDING POINT
WE ROLL OUR AIRCRAFT INTO A BANK
WHEN WILL YOU LEARN THAT FRANK IS A GROWN MAN AND HE'S A SPENCER
I HAVE YOU IN SIGHT
WHERE IS THAT SORT OF MONEY GOING
THAT'S A COME AND BUY ME
SO FROM HAMPSHIRE
WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW
NOT AH NOT A VERY WELL KNOWN FOOTBALLER
IT'S NOT THEY NOT THE SAME
MY VENUE WAS IT WAS ESSENTIALLY A CUPBOARD WITH A CURTAIN UP
IT'S AT THAT POINT YOU THINK
I'VE GOT MORE TO DO THIS WEEK
THANKS FOR WATCHING
I HOPE TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE OUR PARTY GO WITH A
WHICH IS WHERE IT IS NOW
BUT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN SENDING CHRISTMAS CARDS WAS SOMETHING THAT ONLY THE VERY RICH COULD
WHAT WAS NEEDED WAS SOME SHORT
PUNCHY WAY OF COMMUNICATING SEASONAL GREETINGS
IT'S A PRICELESS ARTEFACT
HE WAS ON TO SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY
IT'S THEIR BUSIEST TIME OF THE YEAR
WORK COMES FIRST AND HOME LIFE
AND IT MAY BE THAT THE VOICE HAS GONE BY THEN
IN ORDER TO BE THERE FOR OTHERS
BUT YOU WON'T HEAR THEM FEELING SORRY FOR THEMSELVES
AS MOANS OF SELF PITY DON'T COME NATURALLY
AND WE'VE BEEN EATING THEM AT CHRISTMAS FOR CENTURIES
SOMETHING FROM THE WATER
AND THAT'S THE MAIN
IF YOU HAVE A LOOK THERE
THE CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION EXTENDED OVER A MUCH LONGER PERIOD THAN WE HAVE TODAY
WHICH WAS ST NICHOLAS DAY
AND IN PARTICULAR FOR THE COOK
IT WAS A TIME OF GREAT HARD WORK
NORMAL MINCE PIIES THAT WE WOULD HAVE TODAY
IT SNOWED AT CHRISTMAS
WHAT WEATHER WILL WE HAVE THIS CHRISTMAS IN THREE
THE JOY IS IN THE GIVING
IT'S THE IDEA OF CHRISTMAS PRESENTS AND
WORTH THAT MUCH
COME TO THINK OF IT
IT'S HIS TICKET
IT'S HIS FIFTIETH NEXT YEAR AND IT'S UP TO HIM TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WITH IT
AND TECHNICALLY IT WAS ABSOLUTELY LOVELY
SO A TRUE PORTABLE TIMEKEEPER
WELL OF ALL THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED ON THE ROADTO THIS YEAR
AND I JUST THOUGHT
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER
CERTAINLY I'M NO EXCEPTION
AND A GREAT NAME FOR BRISTOL
TO MAKE SOMETHING UNTO THEMSELVES
I DON'T THINK IT GETS MUCH BETTER THAN THAT
BUT THE POINT IS
IT HADN'T MET ITS RESERVE
GOOD TO SEE ALL THOSE HAPPY FACES
SO WATCH OUT FOR THAT
ON OUR FURTHEST TRIP OUT EAST
THE TEAM FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA
THOUSAND WITH BOTH HANDS
WE PUT OUT THAT APPEAL WE GOT AN AMAZING RESPONSE
THEY WERE FAMILY HISTORY
GETTING THEIR STORIES
BUT IT WASN'T AN OFFICIAL THING
AND HE RECEIVED THE SIGNAL ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH DECEMBER
AND HE WROTE IT DOWN AS IT CAME OVER THE WIRES
A RECENT VISITOR TO OUR SHOW HELD HERE AT TREDEGA HOUSE
ABOUT HIS EXPLOITS IN WORLD WAR II HAD AN ENORMOUS REACTION WHEN HE REVEALED HIS MEETING WITH THE
SO MANY OF YOU RESPONDED TO WHAT ROY HAD TO SAY THAT WE'VE DECIDED TO MEET HIM ONCE AGAIN
GRAHAM LAY HAS BEEN CHATTING TO HIM
TWO MEN WHO SPEND THEIR LIVES PORING OVER JEWELLERY ARE EXPERTS GEOFFREY MUN AND JOHN BENJAMIN
WHEN YOU BOUGHT A BOX AT AUCTION
WE'LL BE CATCHING UP WITH THEM IN A MOMENT
ONE LADY I MET BACK IN BRIGHTON A FEW YEARS AGO
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE WANTED FOR DONKEY'S YEARS AND THAT'S A NARROW BOAT
THAT'S MY NEXT YEAR'S PROJECT
THOUSAND POUNDS UNDER THE HAMMER
SO I WAS VERY THRILLED AND EXCITED FOR HER
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU BOTH AT THE SAME TIME
A WONDERFUL PIECE AND
BUT IT WAS ENORMOUSLY EXCITING
WHAT YOU FELT WHEN YOU SAW THE FILM OF THIS
RICK AND FRANCIS
WHEN I ORIGINALLY FILMED IT HERE
BUT WILL THEY KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BOTTICELLI AND A BOT JOB WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING
I'VE BEEN IN OVER FORTY COUNTRIES
I'VE BEEN IN SAN FRANCISCO
BECAUSE OUR EXPERTS ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO FIND ONE
IT TAKES YOU TO A SITE
GUESS WHAT THE ESTIMATE WAS
EVEN IF WE WERE TAKING IT AWAY FOR YOU
NOT ONLY IS THE ARTIST SHOWING OFF
BUT THE OWNER IS SHOWING OFF A BIT
YOU'RE ON THE ROSTRUM
AND SO YOU DID THE RIGHT THING THERE
WHICH I'M HOLDING FOR CHRISTINA
BECAUSE IT'S A BIT ON THE HEAVY SIDE
WE'RE ALL TRUSTING KATE
IT'S NOT OFTEN I LOSE MY TEMPER BE
I'VE MADE THAT QUITE CLEAR TO HIM
THROUGH THE RAF ASSOCIATION
YOU WERE LATE FOR SCENE ONE
I THINK I'LL HAVE THAT CUP OF TEA AFTER ALL
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP COMPLETELY OUT OF SIGHT OF THE AUDIENCE
I NEVER TAKE NO BOXES DOWN
WITH MY LITTLE EYE
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN DADDY'S LONG JOHN SILVER
THIS IS MR SPENCER FROM OVER THE ROAD
THEY'LL LOOK AT ME AND SAY
WE DIDN'T THINK YOU'D BE IN TODAY
YOU'VE GOT TO CHALLENGE YOURSELF
I THINK IT'S BEEN SAID A LOT THAT HE MADE THE MOST OF HIS TALENTS
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT NECESSARILY
AND THAT'S THAT'S HOW I'M IN THE POSITION THAT I AM TODAY
THESE CONNECTIVE TISSUE
I DON'T THINK SO
NOBODY WOULD BUY IT
IF YOU WANT TO APPEAR IN THE NEXT SERIES ON BBC TWO
THEN DO PLEASE VISIT US ONLINE AT BBC
THANKS FOR WATCHING
I'LL DO A DOUBLE SHIFT
THIS IS SERIOUSLY BAD
STOP PUSHING THIS
THE FIRST CHRISTMAS NUMBER SIX WAS THE FIRST SONG THAT HAD A CHRISTMAS THEME TO IT
THAT'S FINE FOR QUO
BUT NOT WHAT I WANT TO
I DON'T WANT THAT SOUND
CHUBBY OPERA SINGER WHAT'S HER NAME
WERE THERE WITH WINTER IN WINNIPEG
AND THAT'S WHY I CRASHED
THE POLAR BEARS ARE UP AGAINST THE WALL
YOU DON'T DO THIS FOR LOVE OR PASSION
I HAD A HEART ATTACK
AND IT'S DOING QUITE WELL
WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU
MAYBE EVEN RETIRE
HE CAN'T SELL HIS WORLD MUSIC LABEL OR THE BEST STUDIO IN THE WORLD TO SOME BLOODY CORPORATION
WHAT ABOUT ANTIQUES
WHAT IS YOUR EXPECTATION FROM TODAY
IF IT MAKES A PROFIT
WE'LL GIVE IT TO A CHARITY
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT
WHY HAVE WE GOT TWO BELL PUSHES BOTH OF WHICH SAY UP ON
OF A LUMP OF SOCIAL HISTORY
THIS THING WOULD BE LIKELY TO REALISE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
WHAT I WOULD CHOOSE
WE CAN COME DOWN
TIM'S TONGUE IS SPENT
I THINK IT'S SPENT VERY WELL
I THINK MY NURSES
AND YOU WERE MINUS FIFTY TWO
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YOU'RE GOING WITH THE BELT
NO MONEY BEING HANDED OUT
I ASKED FOR A TRAINED
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT
IF YOU'RE BOTH JUST CALM DOWN
IF I CAN GIVE HIM ONE MORE CHANCE
I'VE BEEN CHOSEN
I'VE NEVER BEEN CHOSEN TO DO ANYTHING BEFORE
EXHIBITION OF FRONT DOORS
I WAS A BIT SCARED
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE MEANT TO ASK ME
JOHN HUMPHRIES AND FOUR CELEBRITIES WHO WERE PERSUADED TO PUT THEIR DIGNITY ON THE LINE A FEW
THE OFFICE WAS INTERESTING
IT WAS JUST WHAT I WANTED TO DO
UM AND I WAS WRITING A PLAY AWAY THEN AND I WAS WRITING QUITE ALMOST ALL THE COMEDY
THE HISTORY OF MATHS
IT'S CALLED TALES OF MATHS AND LEGENDS
I THINK WHEN YOU GET THAT CHEMISTRY RIGHT
YOU CAN CREATE A KIND OF I KNOW REAL MAGIC
USUALLY I CO PRESENT WITH A JOG
OR YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON TWITTER ATMA
AND THANKS FOR WATCHING
YOU DON'T SPEAK
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
I JUST CAN'T LET MYSELF
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU HAD
I BELIEVE IN YOU
ONCE I'VE HAD A WORD WITH HER
SQUEEZING FARMERS INTO BANKRUPTCY JUST TO KEEP THEIR SUPERMARKET PRICES DOWN
SHE GOES HER WAY
WE DON'T HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM EACH OTHER
BUT YOUR MACHINE DOESN'T MENTION A BUTTON TO PRESS FOR THAT
MEAN APART FROM THE PRICING
I JUST FELT THE TOP MAN SHOULD KNOW WHAT EXTREME SURVIVAL MEASURES THEY'RE DRIVING WE FARMERS
IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T DO SOMETHING
I'M COMPETING IN THE CARRIAGE TRIALERS THIS AFTERNOON
YOU'RE FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA
THAT'S HARDLY A SURPRISE NOW
AND AUDREY'S INVITING EVERYONE WHO IS ANYONE
I'M SORRY TO IMPOSE
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
IN THE HOUSE AT ALL
SHE WALKED OUT ON ME
AND IF LIVING WITH MARJORY FOR A BIT DOESN'T FORCE THE ISSUE
IF IT'S TO DO WITH HER BELOVED MANOR
I'M NOT ABLE TO TRUST HIM ANY MORE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO GET UP TO NEXT
SOMETHING TO PUT US ON THE MAP
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU PREFER TO CALL ME
AND THEN REMINDS US AGAIN AT ABOUT ELEVEN
OR A SCULLERY MAID
AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I CAN WAIT UNTIL THEN
HE'S MY ARROGANT
SOME THINGS ARE
I WILL NOT HOLD THIS IS AN EMERGENCY
IN THE BEDROOMS
SO WHEN THE TIME COMES
I'VE SEEN OS
AND THEY ARE ONE OF MY ONE OF MY FAVOURITES
THE DIRT ME
IMAGINE THE LOOK ON MIX'S FACE WHEN HE FINDS OUT THAT THAT PRECIOUS LITTLE CARTER BABY INSIDE OF YOU
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
THE THE TRADITIONAL PICTURE OF THE FAMILY CHRISTMAS ISN'T WHAT EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES AND WE HAVE TO BE
BUT WE BECOME THEIR FAMILY
IF IT'S ONLY FOR ONE DAY
AND NOW ON CHRISTMAS MORNING
ALL THINGS WERE MADE
TO THOSE WHO BELIEVED IN HIS NAME
HE GAVE THE RIGHT TO BECOME CHILDREN OF GOD
IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT WE DO WITH HIM
AND AS WITH ANY OTHER PERSON
ANY OTHER RELATIONSHIP
REALLY TOUGH DAY RECENTLY
WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY
THAT MEANS THAT CUSTOMERS CAN CONTACT ME TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY
SHOULD IT BE MY CUSTOMERS
VERY QUICKLY THAT TENSION I WAS HOLDING IN MY SHOULDERS WAS REPLACED WITH
I HAD BEEN STRIVING TO PERFORM
GOD HAS REST FOR THE WEARY
NOT IN OUR TIME
AND THEN WE NEED TO LEAVE IT TO HIM
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE PRAY THAT THEY WILL KNOW YOUR PEACE
THAT THEY WILL KNOW IMMANUEL
WE PRAY FOR THOSE WHO TODAY FEEL AFRAID
THE CHURCH HELPED ME
BRING RECONCILIATION AND FORGIVENESS TODAY
FOR YOUR LIGHT HAS COME
AND HIS GLORY WILL APPEAR OVER YOU
AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD
OUR NEXT CAROL IS ONE OF MY VERY FAVOURITES
AND DESCRIBES HOW
FIRST HE BRINGS THE LIGHT OF LOVE INTO YOUR LIFE
WHICH SIMPLY MEANS
SAYING SOMETHING LIKE THIS
IT'S A WELL KNOWN FACT YOU KNOW THAT EVERY THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS
COMPARED WITH LITTLE RODNEY'S HAPPINESS
SECOND FAVOURITE FOR THE DERBY NEXT YEAR
CAN WE HAVE SOME SERVICE
SHE LIVES OVER IN ZIMBABWE HOUSE
YOU'RE NOT BUFF AS WELL
I'M REALLY ENJOYING MYSELF
MY DAUGHTER IS MARRYING NO ONE
YOUR BROTHER IS NOT I REPEAT NOT MARRYING MY DAUGHTER
WHY DON'T WE GO INTO YOUR STUDY AND DISCUSS IT OVER A GLASS OF
WINE IS A MOCKER
IF I CAN GET THROUGH THIS FIRST CHRISTMAS WITHOUT UNDUE TRAUMA
BUT I SAID NOTHING ABOUT DESTROY
I DO THE CRIB EVERY YEAR
LOOKING BACK ON IT
ONE YEAR MARTIN WAS THE FIRST TO FIND ME
ALL EMOTIONALLY SHOT
THAT'S WHAT I'M SUFFERING FROM DOWN HERE
DON'T GET ME WRONG
THERE'S MORE SECURITY DOWN THERE THAN IN ANY AIRPORT
IF IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE
BUT IT'S MY BELIEF THAT ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTY THESE DAYS SHOULD BE BARRED FROM HANDLING OTHER
HE'S JUST UNDER A LITTLE EXTRA PRESSURE
DON'T TRY AND RUSH YOUR FENCES
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
YOU MUST TRY HARDER
WHICH LEAVES THE TOP HALF
I'LL DO A DOUBLE SHIFT
STOP PUSHING THIS
YOU DON'T SPEAK
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
I WENT THERE BECAUSE I WANTED A DRINK
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS NEVER GOING TO BE THERE AGAIN
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
I JUST CAN'T LET MYSELF
THE DAILY
PAST FEW MONTHS I'VE BEEN EASY
I DIDN'T I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT
I DON'T THINK EMMA'S TRYING TO TAKE HER PLACE
ALL EMOTIONALLY SHOT
WHY ARE YOU EVEN ASKING ME THIS ANYWAY
AND FOUR CONTENDERS WHO ARE ALL EXPERTS IN THEIR OWN FIELDS
I THINK JUST STORIES THAT PEOPLE
DO YOU THINK WE DO EXPECT DIFFERENT STANDARDS
FRAIL MINDED PEOPLE WHO
WHICH IF YOU'RE A WRITER
AND I FIRST WENT THERE FORTY YEARS AGO
DROPPED OUT OF UNIVERSITY
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CELEBRITY TO TAKE PART IN THE REGULAR MASTERMIND PROGRAMME
THANKS FOR WATCHING
WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE PLACE WHERE ONE SIR HENRY ROYCE WAS BORN IN
SUSANAN LIKES RUSSIAN THINGS AND TRENCH ART
I LIKE SHOPPING
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THESE THINGS AT THIRTY
IF WE BELIEVE THOMAS
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW
AND FOUR CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE BOWED TO PRESSURE AND AGREED TO BE TESTED ON HOW MUCH THEY KNOW
I THINK IT WAS A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO BE GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE
I CRAWLED THROUGH A PIT OF TRIANGULAS ON THE CHALLENGE THAT I ACTUALLY VOLUNTEERED TO DO
YOU KNOW I JUST FEEL SO GRATEFUL THAT DOING A JOB THAT I LOVE DOING
I LIKE HIS CHARACTER
EVERYBODY WHO WORKS FOR THE BBC
I LOOK AS IF I ENJOY IT
I ALWAYS BREAK THAT RULE
OR YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON TWITTER AT MASTERMIND QUIZ
DO JOIN US AGAIN NEXT TIME FOR MORE MASTERMIND THANKS FOR WATCHING
AND THE SACKED YOU
THAT'S ALL FROM ME FOR NOW
BUT ME LIKE THAT STAFF
I THINK YOU'RE SO CLEVER
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
SO WE DECIDED TO BUY A BROOD MARE
TODAY YOU'VE GOT TO TACKLE
THROW INTO THE LINE OUT
DID QUITE A FEW ADVERTS
THE IDEA IS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE A PROFIT
GET THE COMPASS
YOU CAN'T COMBINE
AND MY VOTE TODAY
WE MUSTN'T GET TOO CHILDISH BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO HEAD OFF RIGHT NOW TO THE MUSEUM OF
THE BEARS ARE MY FAVOURITE TOYS
AND QUITE RIGHT
HOW WILL OUR TEAMS EXPRESS THEIR PASSION OVER AT THE AUCTION
HAD ONE OF THEIR MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY
AND HE'S GONE OFF AND BOUGHT THE TEAM'S BONUS BUY
SO IT'S RIGHT DOWN IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH
THAT WILL AH PROBABLY COST THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE TWENTY SEVEN
SO THAT'S THE RIGHT PRICE
AND THE RIGHT ESTIMATE
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS
NEED TO CROSS MORE THAN MY FINGERS
NOW FOR THE BLUES
I WOULD SAY THAT IT PROBABLY IS
BUT WE HAVE A LESSER ESTIMATE ON IT
BUT WE COULD ALL BE WRONG
LET'S ROOT FOR IT
THEY'LL NEED ONE OR OTHER OR NEITHER OF THEIR BO SPIES
YOU ARE MINUS FORTY SIX
UM SMASHING TO SEE YOUR LOVELY FACES AGAIN
AND I TREASURE YOU FOREVER
I DO HAVE QUALMS
IF YOU WANT ME TO BE SERIOUS
IT WAS SHOWING YOU WEREN'T GOING TO ABANDON ME
BECAUSE I AM ON FIRE
DON'T PRESSURE ME SOCIALLY
I'D LIKE TO SHARE THOUGHTS ON MARRIAGE
REMEMBER THE NAME
I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO MISS MAPP AS A GIFT
THAT HE IS IN MY EMPLOYMENT
ALONG WITH MRS WISE
IS WHAT I MUST SPEAK ABOUT
FOR AS LONG AS HE CAN
NO ONE BREAKS US
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SAW IN MY COUSIN
BUT WILL THEY SINK OR WILL THEY SWIM
WELL IT WAS WORTHWHILE
NOW THE THREE HUNDRED PO MOMENT
YOU ARE A LIFEGUARD AND YOU LOVE YOUR SURFING
WHETHER IT BE LAKES
AND THEN I'VE BEEN DRAGGING HIM AWAY FROM TOY SHOPS EVER SINCE AND MANAGED TO PERSUADE THEM TO
SO WE'VE STILL GOT BAGS OF TIME
BUT IT'S LOOKING REALLY GOOD
IT WOULD BE PRETTY OBVIOUS WHAT IT IS
THE REALLY WEIRD THING ABOUT THIS BONE IS THAT AT THAT TIME
SO THEY ARE ACTUALLY A USABLE THING
BUT HAVING THAT WITHIN THE BODY OF IT JUST MAKES IT THAT LITTLE BIT MORE COLLECTIBLE
APART FROM THE FACT THAT I MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE TO RUN
WHY DON'T WE FIND OUT HOW CAROLINE HALL IS GETTING ON WITH HER PURCHASES OF HER BONUS
IT'S ONLY A PREDICTION AFTER ALL
WHY DON'T WE HAVE A LOOK AT HOW POOR COLIN YOUNG IS GETTING ON WITH THE BLUE TEAM'S BONUS
I WOULD SAY IT WOULD MAKE TEN
WHEN YOU'RE BUYING SILVER
IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO GO FOR ON THINGS LIKE CUTLERY AND FLATWARE
FOR OUR LOVELY AUDIENCE
A MUSEUM OF SOCIAL HISTORY
SHE THROWS HER STUFF IN PORCELAIN
EITHER ONE OF THE BONUS BUYS
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
NOW FOR THE BLUES
AND THE FIRST ONE IS THE VASE
SHARON'S HAD TO GO TO WATFORD TO RUN AN ERRAND
NEARLY HAD TO CHANGE MY FLIGHT
ALL OPERATIONS CARRY RISKS
CAN IT BE SEPARATED FROM IT
AND WHEN I MADE A QUICK SEARCH OF MY OWN HUMBLE POSSESSIONS
DON'T TELL ME THAT WRETCHED GURU MADE OFF WITH THAT AS WELL
SO LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
AND WHICH IS VERY SMALL AND VERY REMOTE
RIGHT NOW THOUGH
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
SHE PRESSED IT LIKE THAT
LOOKED AT THE THINGS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CRACK
NOW THE BIG THING IS
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT CHARLES HANSON
YOU JUST GOT THE ROLEX CASE
ONE VAGUELY PROFITABLE ONE
WHICH MAY NOT BE ENOUGH
AND TO BE HONEST
AND YOU THINK OF BACK TO WHEN THEY COULD
WHETHER I HATE IT OR I END UP LOVING IT
AND I SUPPOSE THAT'S GOOD FOR MYSELF IN A WAY BECAUSE THEN
NOT THAT WE COULDN'T CHANGE IT
WHILE I HAVE YOU
I WOULDN'T ADVISE CRIBBING THAT ONE
ABOUT YOUR ITALIAN AND YOUR INFLUENZA AND EVERYTHING
IF THEY DO DECIDE TO MARRY
SUFFERED OR SACRIFICED FOR THIS COUNTRY
FOR THIS COUNTRY
BECAUSE WHEN WE'RE GENEROUS
THAT HAS A POPULATION OF FOUR
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT WE SELL MORE TO IRELAND
I HAD A BUDGET OF JUST SEVEN
AND I CHANGED THE ENGINE IN IT
HE'LL TAKE A BREAK BEFORE THE TOP
I ALREADY HAVE A UNION JACK ON THE ROOF
IF I PUT AN INDIAN FLAG ON THE BONNET
I WAS LYING ABOUT IT NOT WORKING
IT WORKS PERFECTLY WELL
MEANING MAKING SURE SOMETHING STARTS AUSPICIOUSLY
WHICH IS KIND OF ACTIVE
ACTUALLY DOING STUFF
I'M DOING THE BIG
A SMALL CREATURE
I'VE DONE IT PROPERLY
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME I'VE HAD TO GET OVER GARY
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE ON MY OWN
IM A MUTUAL DUER
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED
AND FOR HIM TO BE OVER ME
IF I WORE SOMETHING NICE
I HAVE TO TELL HIM I STOOD UP TO MUM
BECAUSE IN THE WORDS OF YOUR FAVOURITE SINGER
I'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE AND I'VE DANCED IN MAJOR FINALS AT BLACK BULL DANCE
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DANCING FOR
IN RECENT YEARS
IT'S IT'S REALLY BOUNCY
IT'S REALLY CHEEKY
KICKING YOUR LEGS
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE OF THOSE BEFORE
TO GROW SOMETHING IN
RATHER CHEAPER THAN GOING TO THE PACIFIC
WE'RE GOING TO GO FOR THE SMALL BUYS
THEY MADE CHAIRS
IT'S READY TO GO
ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT
THEY WERE TAKEN INTO CONCENTRATION CAMPS
IN THIS COUNTRY
MASONS WENT QUIET
WAS TO GO QUIET AFTER THE WAR AS WELL
IF YOU DON'T TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU ARE DOING
THAT'S THE EXCITEMENT
AND I'M DELIGHTED TO BE PROVEN WRONG
BUT THAT WAS MY CHOICE
AND THEY ONLY PAID FORTY
LIKE ALL THOSE WHO'VE GONE BEFORE
HAVE BEEN SWATTING UP LIKE MAD ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECTS
THERE WILL BE A TIE BREAK
THE SIX HIGHEST SCORING RUNNERS UP WILL BE ABLE TO CLAIM A PLACE IN THE SEMIFINALS
PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
AND YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON TWITTER
THANKS FOR WATCHING
IF HE FINDS OUT
RONNIE MITCHELL MIGHT BE A STUCK UP LITTLE MADAM
AND RONNIE WILL GET BETTER
MY MUM USED TO HAVE ONE
WE ALL LIKE A BIT OF MACHINERY THAT CAN ACTUALLY SAVE US TIME
AND CHEF ANDY BATES HAS BEEN TO SEE IF A RETRO BIT OF KIT CAN ACTUALLY HELP US GETTING OUR MODERN
OVER THE NEXT YEAR
IT WASN'T ENOUGH
UNCTUOUS RED WINE THAT WOULD JUST KIND OF SOAK YOU INTO A BIG COMFY CHAIR
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TURNED IT AROUND
IN RETURN FOR MY LIFE
I SWORE AN OATH OF LOYALTY TO SPAIN
DUTY MUST COME FIRST
AND FOUR PEOPLE WHO WILL BE TESTED
ON WHAT THEY KNOW OR THINK THEY KNOW
THEIR FEE GOES TO CHARITY
BUT THE WINNER GETS A TROPHY AND
SO I WAS USING THE EDINBURGH FESTIVAL AS A JUMP OFF POINT
THEY GOT A BIT OF A SURPRISE
BUT IT HELPED WITH MY
THE GREAT ASPECT ABOUT BRITAIN IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY THEATRES AND THERE'S A WAY OF OF TOURING
I NEVER THOUGHT FOR A SECOND I WOULD WORK ON THE TELEVISION
AND I THINK PRESENTERS ARE A BIT LIKE MUSIC
KIND OF LIKE BOXING
IT WAS IT WAS A TOTALLY IMPROVISATIONAL THING
I'M CONCERNED ENOUGH ABOUT THAT
I CAN'T THINK ABOUT RAP
I WAS JUST REALLY
BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF SIMILAR SKILLS IN THAT YOU HAVE TO CONNECT WITH YOUR AUDIENCE
THROUGH YOUR EYES AND THROUGH
BUT ON RADIO IT'S IT'S COMPLETELY THROUGH YOUR VOICE
AND YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON TWITTER AT MASTERMIN QUIZ
DO JOIN US AGAIN NEXT TIME FOR MORE MASTERMIND
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT
AND THE NEXT DAY
WITH US LIKE A GUIDING STAR
WHAT ELSE COULD I DO
I AM TALKING TO YOU
I'M ON TRIP BEFORE YOU CAN SAY
AND MY NOSE IS VERY SENSITIVE SO I THOUGHT
SOME OF US YOUNG BLADES DECIDED WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD NIGHT OUT
SAW THE SHOW AT THE GAGE THEATRE
THE WORLD'S GONE MAD
YOU'LL BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE
THAT THAT CHILD IS IN DANGER
DON'T TELL HANNA
SOME SPAGHETTI HOOPS
I KNOW THIS IS ALL MY FAULT
WHAT MORE CAN WE DO FOR HER
WEARING YESTERDAY'S PANTS
AND I'LL ALSO BE LOOKING THROUGH THE ARCHIVES
TOASTING SOME OF THE CELEBRATIONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN PART IN OVER THE YEARS
I'LL BE LIFTING A GLASS TO ENGLISH WINE
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS PROVENANCE
THAT'S WHY WINE IS SO INTERESTING
AND THE REASON YOU CAN DO THAT
AND IT'S INFLUENCED BY LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS
BUT THERE'S ALSO THE SOIL TYPES
IS THIS ABOUT FERTILITY
OR THE BRINGINGING IN A SUMMER
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO
I'VE ALWAYS SAID TO THE RED OSS THAT THEY CAN COME IN
WHEN HE'S ON TRUFFLE
THEN IF HE SUDDENLY GOES MAD
THINGS LIKE THIS I LIKE TO GIVE BACK TO THE WOODLAND
I THINK LIGHT IN THIS COUNTRY
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT AS WARM AS OUR OTHER MEDITERRANEAN TRUFFLE PRODUCING COUNTRIES
I THINK WE NEED A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT
IT'S GETTING TOO HOT IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND THE WEATHER'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE SUITABLE OVER HERE
DOUBLE THAT THOUGHT
BUT THEY SHOULD NEVER GET ANY BIGGER THAN THIS
JUST STOOD BEHIND YOU
THE MORE INFORMATION WE'VE GOT
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
FIRST ITEM BOUGHT
WE'RE HEADING OFF TO THE JEFFREY MUSEUM IN LONDON'S EAST END
WE'RE IN SAFE HANDS
THE ROLLERCOASTER OF LIFE
THAT IS A PROFIT OF FIVE
POUND THAT IS FIVE POUND PROFIT
I'M AFRAID BUT OVERALL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THAT IS MINUS EIGHTY
THAT'S GOING TO BE IT
YOU ARE STILL MINUS EIGHTY
MUCH OF OUR RICH AND VARIED LIVESTOCK HERITAGE HAS BEEN LOST FOREVER
AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE NATIONAL HERD AS WELL
DEPEND ON YOU ASK
THE PERSON WHO WAS DEDICATED TO CHEESE MAKING
DOING LIKE WE'VE JUST DONE
THAT WAS DEEMED TO BE HOVEN
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ADULT BREEDING FEMALES LEFT
BUT WE SENT BOTH AWAY PREGNANT
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE WEATHER'S GOING TO BE LIKE WITH THE COUNTRYFILE FORECAST FOR THE WEEK AHEAD
AND YOU SAID TO ME
AND I HAPPENED TO KNOW THAT SIMON GILBY WAS ABOUT TO DISPERSE HIS ESSEX HERD
AND I SAID TO YOU
THERE ARE PLENTY MORE VERY GOOD HERDS
HE CAME OUT SMILING
AND YOU DIDN'T SEE GRAIL SMILE VERY OFTEN
MY DAD HAD A MEDITERRANEAN CHARACTER WHICH
PART OF YOUR BRAIN IS THINKING
GO TO THE SAME RESTAURANTS
AND MY LEGS WERE OK
UP YOUR ARMS AND INTO YOUR MIND
IT WAS MY PRIVATE LIFE
WITHOUT A DOUBT
WAS THE BEST RIDER IN THE WORLD IN SEVENTY SIX AND
BRINGING MORE PEOPLE IN
AND SO THEY BENEFITED FROM THAT
GET OUT THERE AND TWIST ROTLE AND GO AS HARD AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
AH PEOPLE FALLING OFF THEIR BIKES AND STUFF
AH WE ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER
WE DO CHARITIES BASED ACROSS THE UK
AND BEFORE THAT
A COMBINATION ITEM
WHEN YOU BOUGHT A MECHANICAL WATCH
OLD MOBILE PHONES
BIG MOBILE PHONES
AND THEN IT GOT FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER
ON THIS GLORIOUS
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GO AND SEARCH FOR
SO LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT
WE' CALLED IT REPRODUCTION
SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT
SINGING CHRISTMAS SONGS
WHAT WAS BEING
THE FACT THAT IT'S JANUARY
THAT'S NOT REALLY THE BEST OPTION AT THIS TIME
THERE WAS A PROBLEM
NOW WE'D BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE SHORTLY AFTER WE ARRIVED IN ARGENTINA BUT THERE WAS NOTHING
YOU CAN'T JUST CHANGE A CAR'S NUMBER PLATES
NOW AWI IS THE CITY FROM WHICH THE BATTLESHIP BELGRANO SAILED ON ITS FINAL VOYAGE AT
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT
SORRY FOR BEING BORING
TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY
IT'S OF MY FATHER
AND CONRAD DRESSLER
HOW OLD WOULD YOU IMAGINE IT WAS
AND YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT
WHICH IT SAYS THERE
SO THEY'RE A BIT WOBBLY AND A BIT RICKETY
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T DO IT ALL THE TIME
AND THE STUFF MADE AFTER THE WAR IS MUCH STRONGER COLOURS
SHE'S NEVER SWEET AT HOME
PEOPLE THOUGHT MY MOTHER WAS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR
THANK YOU FOR COMING
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE LOOKED THROUGH HIS NOTES
NOBODY TOLD ME HE'D BANGED HIS HEAD
EVER HAD A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN
YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT BUT
LET'S FIND OUT IF IT'S GOING TO SELL IN THE ROOM
SO I'VE COME TO HEBDEN BRIDGE
TURNED INTO SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL
YOU PROBABLY KNOW JUST AS AS WELL AS I DO
UM THE FAIRLY COMMON DESIGN AS I SAY
I KNOW THIS IS HARD
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT TO RONNIE
WE CARRY ON AS NORMAL
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING
I HAD NO CHOICE
I HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT
I SAID I SAW HIM
I KNOW IT'S HARD
AH FIGURES FROM THE HALIFAX SAY IT'S THE HIGHEST LEVEL FOR SEVEN YEARS
IT'S UP MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT ON TWENTY THIRTEEN
POLICE HAVE DROPPED AN INVESTIGATION INTO RAPE CLAIMS AGAINST A TORY MP
MARK PRITCHARD IS NOW CALLING FOR A REVIEW ON LAWS WHICH ALLOW ANONYMITY FOR ALLEGED VICTIMS
WORRY ABOUT YOUR OWN TIMEKEEPING
AND BUT I'M DERWOOD THOMPSON
YOU'RE ALWAYS HELPING HER
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S LIKE
SUPERIOR TAAL BALLISTICS
WHICH IT WASN'T
JACK PULLED SOME DATA FROM HIS PHONE
WE'RE NOT BEHIND SCHEDULE TWO THINGS IN FORTY MINUTES IS THE SCHEDULE
TECHNOLOGY AND HISTORY COMBINED
YOU BETTER BEATTLE OFF
BUT RIGHT NOW WHY DON'T WE CHECK OUT FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT
NOR TO ANY OF MY FAMILY
KNOWN FOR YEARS
AND FOR THE RECORD
ALL I CLAIMED WAS THE EXPENSE OF INSTALLING A NEW PHONE LINE INTO MY MOTHER'S HOUSE
YOUR HOUSE WENT BACK ONTO FIELDS
I THOUGHT IT FIZZLED OUT
JACKIE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO CALL ME
I HAVE BEEN WORKING ROUND THE CLOCK FIGHTING THIS
LIKE I WORK ROUND THE CLOCK LOOKING AFTER MUM
MAYBE I AM FINISHED
I BROUGHT SOME FLOWERS
AND THERE IS NO EXCUSING WHAT I DID
I WAS TERRIFIED
EVERY SECOND OF EVERY SHIFT
THIS LANDSCAPE WOULD HAVE BEEN BUSTLING WITH ACTIVITY
IT'S ALL PEACEFUL AND QUIET
BUT PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY
AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
WHEN THEY GET TO SORT OF TWENTY YEARS OLD
WHICH MAKES SOME VARIETIES WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD
AND IS THIS WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET
THAT MUST HAVE AN UNDERWATER ENTRANCE TO THE LODGE
IT CAN BE UP TO TEN DEGREES WARMER THAN THAN OUTSIDE
DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF YEAR
EVERYTHING THAT YOU GET IN THIS FOREST
WE'VE NEVER CAUGHT ANYTHING ELSE
NOBODY HAS EVER HEARD OF IT
WE SHOULD BE AFTER THIS LOT
SOME THINK THAT MAY BE THE OLDEST ITEM HERE OR THE LARGEST OR THE HEAVIEST
I DO APPRECIATE IT
THEY'RE RIGHT NEXT TO US
THANK YOU SO MUCH
YOU READ ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME
WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
YEAH IT MEANS THEY'RE WORRIED AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT
YOU GOT A MAN UP
AND THAT'S WHY I GAVE HIM TO ROXY
IT'S BEEN MOUNTED IN SILVER
LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
ENTITLED THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
LONG TIME AND I'M TELLING YOU
COUPLE OF DAYS IT'LL BLOW OVER
YOU DON'T MAKE ANY EFFORT WITH HIM
BUT I JUST COULDN'T
BUT IF HE LOVES ME
GO AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND
THIS MARVELLOUS CATHEDRAL AND ABBEY CHURCH BEHIND ME WAS DEDICATED TO HIM
I THINK IT'S NINE THIRTY
IT'S BEEN RAINING BUT THANKFULLY THERE ARE NO PUDDLES
SO OUR GALLANT EXPERT
THE TOWN OR THE CITY THAT YOU LIVE IN
SOME EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO
HE HAD A SPECIAL CLOAK
BY TAKING THE THE CLOAK
IT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST OF THE ROMAN CITIES
HOPEFULLY TOWARDS MY DAD'S
YOU'RE OUT IN THE ROOM
I'M SELLING AWAY FROM YOU THEN AT SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY
WE'VE HAD A BRILLIANT DAY HERE INRI
ARE WE GOING TO START HIM OFF AT FIVE HUNDRED POUND
IF YOU GOT A POINT TO MAKE
I'M CAT SLATE A BONA FIDE SLAG
I WANT A DIVORCE
TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE
THREE LOVELY ITEMS
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF IT MAKES EIGHTY OR NINETY
I SAID TO MY COLLEAGUES
HAPPENED IN THE AUCTION
AND YOU'LL BE THERE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO MAKE
I WOULDN'T KNOW EITHER BUT
BUT THEY PAID NINETY FIVE
WHAT WITH THE PARACHUTE AND THE MEASURE AND IT COULD GO SERIOUSLY
WHY SHOULDN'T WE
HE'S GOT THE DOWRY
GOT WHAT YOU WANTED
GOOD OLD ROYAL DOULTON
WE'VE COME TO THE POTTERIES
FROM STOKE ON TRENT
IT'S NO WONDER THAT WHEN THE POTTERIES FIRST OPENED UP
THEN IT'S OFF TO THE AUCTION ROOM TOO
SO I THINK THIS IS WHERE IT CAME FROM
I REALLY LIKE IT
IT CAUGHT MY EYE FROM ACROSS THE ROOM
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO PUT THOSE VALUATIONS TO THE TEST
THAT'S WHY WE GO OFF TO AUCTION
AND SO WHILE WE MAKE OUR WAY OVER THERE
BROUGHT BACK ON VERY LARGE SAILING VESSELS FROM THE TROPICS
BUT WHAT DO THE OUTSIDERS THINK
THE GREAT VISIONARY AS ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE
I'VE JUST GONE THROUGH THAT
AND IF THEY DON'T MAKE THAT
THIS ONE DATES FROM THE END OF THE NINETEENTH
FOUR CONTENDERS ARE ABOUT TO TEST THEMSELVES ON TELEVISION'S TOUGHEST QUIZ
THEY WILL EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT
AND IF THERE IS A TIE AT THE END OF IT THEN
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A CONTENDER IN THE NEXT SERIES
THANKS FOR WATCHING
IT'S NOT LONG AGO THAT A DAY OFF THE BOOZE MEANT A PINT OF WARM FIZZY POP
POSSIBLY A FUNNY LOOK FROM THE BARMAN
THE KING IS NOT ALONE HE HAS DTAN
I HAVE COMPLETE FAITH IN YOU
I WILL KEEP THEM SAFE FOR NOW
I KNOW THIS IS HARD
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT TO RONNIE
LAST THING WE NEED IS THE YOUR SQUARE GOSSIPING
I HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT
I SAID I SAW HIM
WHAT NONSENSE IS THIS
I KNOW IT'S HARD
YOU READ ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME
WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IT MEANS THEY'RE WORRIED AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT
AFRAID YOU COULDN'T LOOK AFTER IT
YOU GOT A MAN UP
AND THAT'S WHY I GAVE HIM TO ROXY
AND HE JUST WANTS TO HELP
IF YOU GOT A POINT TO MAKE
I'M CAT SLATE A BONA FIDE SLAG
THAT'S THE POINT
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF
YEAH I'M A LIAR AND I'M A CHE BUT
IT'S A HUGE AREA
BUT WE SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER THE BRAVE LIVES LOST IN OTHER WARS
AND CHERISH THOSE MEMORIES
THOSE STORIES AND THOSE ITEMS THAT ARE LEFT BEHIND
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
IT'S THE WEIGHT BEHIND THE STORY AND THE PERSONAL SENTIMENT THAT PUTS THE VALUE ON THE OBJECT
NO IT WON'T WORK THIS WEEK
JUST GIVE ME A FEW MORE WEEKS AND I'LL GET IT SORTED OUT
IF YOU SAW IT ON A FILM YOU'D THINK
THAT'S A GREAT BIT OF FICTION
BUT IT DID HAPPEN
WHICH WAS CARRIED IN THE BREAST POCKET
IF YOU ARE SITTING ON SOMETHING RELATED TO A RELATIVE'S WAR STORIES
THINK TWICE ABOUT SELLING IT
IF YOU DO WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN
YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS
IF YOU SELL IT IN AN AUCTION ROOM
IT'S GONE FOREVER
THE CAPTAIN OF THE PLANE HAS BEEN INJURED
WE'RE GOING DOWN
AND THE VOICE PIPES UP
YOU'RE VERY PROUD OF HIM
SHE'S GOT TWO GRANDCHILDREN BUT THEY NEVER KNEW HIM
THEY SHOULD BE ON DISPLAY SO YOU CAN ENJOY THEM
THIS ONE'S MADE OUT OF A COCONUT SHELL
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT KEEN ON GUNS AND SWORDS AND SPEARS AROUND THE HOUSE
BECAUSE I'VE GOT YOUNG CHILDREN
IF YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
THEY WILL GIVE YOU AN AUCTION ALERT
TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE THE SALE
THEY WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT'S GOING FOR AND WHERE IT'S GOING SO
SO YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO BID ON IT
THEY DO ALL THE LEGWORK FOR YOU
BUT I DO HAVE ONE ITEM OF MILITARY
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY
IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT GOING OUT AND DOING SOME BUYING AND SELLING
IF SERANT WILSON INTERRUPTS
THAT CHAPTER
I MAY HAVE TO RECONSIDER YOUR POSITION IN THE CHURCH
THIS HENRY WAS THE NEW YEAR'S PRINCE
WHAT'S YOUR READING OF THAT
AND EVEN GET THEM CANDLES
HAMPTON COURT WAS ALL ABOUT SHOWING OFF
AND HIS MAGNIFICENCE
A BATHROOM WITH RUNNING WATER
PEOPLE GATHERED TO PRAY FOR HER
THAT IT WOULD LITERALLY TAKE UP THE ENTIRE SPACE IN THE CHAPEL
EVEN ROYAL ONES
IN EDWARD'S CASE
I DON'T THINK IT WAS
BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY
AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT ACTUALLY HAS SUCH PRESTIGE IS THERE'S A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF IT
SO IT MAKES IT HARDER TO GET HOLD OF
IT'S A VERY GOOD THING THAT YOU'RE ALL NATIVES OF THIS PLACE
WITH GREAT CHAINS OF OFFICE
WITH EVERYBODY STILL IN THE CHAPEL
HIS SON EDWARD WAS A TRUE BELIEVER
HE WAS THE LAST TUDOR
THERE WOULD NEVER BE ANOTHER TUDOR CHRISTENING
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN TEA TONIGHT
I NEED TO DO A FULL NEURO EXAM
AFTER FIFTY YEARS OF MARRIAGE
WHERE DID I GO WRONG
AGAINST HER WILL
JUST SUGGESTED BEING
AND FOUR PEOPLE WHO HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO BE PUT TO THE TEST ON BRITAIN'S TOUGHEST QUIZ
THEY DON'T GET A FEE
IT GOES TO CHARITY
I'M NO DIFFERENT
IT IS INCREDIBLE
IT'S ABOUT COMING TOGETHER
A LOT OF PERIOD DRAMAS FOR THE BBC
I JUST DON'T THINK THE RSC WILL ASK ME
RATHER THAN TO PUSH
NO I WASN'T THE BEST IN MY REGION
FARMS AND BUSINESSES IS A HOT TOPIC
THIS IS WHAT WE TRY TO ACHIEVE
AND SO BEEF IS THE MAIN ENTERPRISE
AND IF I CAN PRODUCE AS MUCH OF THAT AS POSSIBLE FROM GRASSLAND
AND IF I FEED BETTER QUALITY GRASS
BUT WE HAVE HAD ACTUALLY A WEEK OF RAIN A FEW WEEKS AGO AND I'VE SEEN THE WAY THAT THE RIVER
MAJOR ROADWORKS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT AND THERE'VE ALSO BEEN EXTENSIVE REPAIRS TO DEFENCES
AFTER THE WETTEST WINTER ON RECORD
WILDLIFE ESCAPED RELATIVELY UNSCATHED BUT
STILL ELEVEN GREAT MONTHS TO ENJOY
WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
PEOPLE GETTING READY FOR WORK
AH SHORTLY AFTER THAT
HARD HAT AND THE REST OF IT
KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL AND TRAINS ON THIS RURAL STRETCH OF RAIL NETWORK WERE BUSINESS AS USUAL
YOU'VE GOT TWO MINUTES
SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE
FOR THE ECONOMY
SURREY HERE WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT
THE FREQUENCY OF THE FLOODING IS
EVERY THREE TO FOUR YEARS
WE DECIDED TO SELL THE HERD
BUT THE TROUBLE IS
AND ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE SOME NEW MONEY TO PROTECT A FURTHER THREE HUNDRED
THREE BILLION POUND FLOOD DEFENCE PROGRAMME WHICH THEY SAY WILL IMPROVE PROTECTION OF HOMES
BUT IF WE WANT TO PROTECT MORE PEOPLE AND MORE PROPERTIES AND MORE BUSINESSES
WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THOSE CAPITAL SCHEMES
SO WITHOUT OXYGEN
THOUSAND ACRES OF ARABLE
AND WE COULD BE GOING ACROSS IT UP TO TEN TIMES
CONTINUE TO BROWSE
WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE
I ALWAYS KEEP A FEW BARGAINS FOR THOSE WHO ARE SOCIALLY SUPERIOR
I CAN'T SEE MY GREAT FRIEND
NORMALLY BY THIS TIME
I LIKE TO KEEP MY LITTLE SECRETS
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT IT COMES FROM
TO BE YOUR BASIC COFFEE
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW VERY OLD FAMILIES WHO KNOW WHERE THE NOGGET SITES ARE
WOULD YOU BELIEVE SHE IS EIGHTY NINE
DON'T KEEP REMINDING ME OF YOUR MOTHER
NEXT TIME SHE'S ABOUT
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
DON'T LEAVE HALF OF YOU OUTSIDE
WHAT DO YOU WANT NEW CLOTHES FOR
WE SHOULD HAVE A BIT OF A CEREMONY
I BELIEVE THERE ARE THINGS OF NO MORTAL FLESH AND BLOOD
PLEASE REMAIN SEATED
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
AND IT WAS AT THAT POINT
I WASN'T MARRIED
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
KNOWING WHAT THOSE FORCES ARE THAT DRIVE IT
KNOWING AND TRYING TO DISCOVER WHAT SORT OF STATE OF ACTIVITY IT'S IN NOW
I'M BEGINNING TO REALISE
IT'S WAY TOO HIGH
DESIGNED TO SCAN THE ENTIRE SKY
INSTEAD OF STARING INTENTLY AT INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS
IN THE FULL ARRAY
THE PIXELS IN THIS ARE MUCH
FOR THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE WE'VE HAD SOME RECENT
VERY EXCITING SURVEY DATA
ALL OF A SUDDEN
IT'S EVEN MORE COMPLICATED AND IT'S IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE TO UNDERSTAND HOW HOW WE PUT THIS TOGETHER
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
AND SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN
IF OUR GALAXY HAS THESE COMPLICATED STRUCTURES AT THE CENTRE
OR WAS IT THE MERGER OF A MASSIVE GALAXY WHERE WE ACTUALLY THEN WENT ON AND ACCUMULATED AND
IT WILL ALLOW US TO LOOK UP AT OUR GALAXY AND DEDUCE THE PROPERTIES OF DARK MATTER FROM WHAT
BUT IT'S WHAT MAKES ASTRONOMY SO EXCITING
COMING TOWARDS US
THEY'RE CLUMPING TOGETHER NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN GRAVITY
ALTHOUGH THAT MUST BE IMPORTANT
BUT BECAUSE OF THE GRAVITY OF THE DARK MATTER
THERE ARE EXPERIMENTS BURIED DEEP UNDERGROUND TRYING TO CAPTURE THE PARTICLES OF DARK MATTER USING
THERE ARE PARTICLE ACCELERATORS
LIKE THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER
WHICH ARE TRYING TO CREATE THE PARTICLES OF DARK MATTER
IT MIGHT BE THAT AFTER WE'VE HAD TIME TO ANALYSE THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION PROVIDED BY
IT MIGHT BE THAT ALL OUR CALCULATIONS WERE IN FACT WRONG
AND THAT DARK MATTER DOESN'T EXIST AT ALL
RATHER THAN THE BRIGHT VIEW WE GET DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS
AND THIS IS BECAUSE DURING THE WINTER WE ARE LOOKING OUT THROUGH A THINNER PORTION OF THE MILKY WAY
THE PLANE OF THE MILKY WAY RIDES VERY HIGH IN THE SKY DURING THE WINTER AND THE SUMMER
AND EACH VIEW GIVES US A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF OUR OWN GALAXY
AND IF YOU HAVE A DARK SKY
JUPITER IS REALLY WELL POSITIONED AND IT'S ABOUT TO OFFER UP A REALLY RARE EVENT
WITH DETAILS OF THIS AND OTHER HIGHLIGHTS VISIBLE IN THIS MONTH'S NIGHT SKY
IN THESE STELLAR DEATHS WE CAN REVEAL HOW MANY OF OUR ELEMENTS WERE CREATED
WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT THEM FOR A LONG TIME
AND ALSO HOW THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING
WHAT GAIA WILL DO IS WILL HELP US FIND MANY MORE OF THESE THINGS AS THEY HAPPEN
WHEN THE DARK STAR GOES BEHIND THE BRIGHT STAR
YOU DON'T REALLY SEE ANY CHANGE IN THE BRIGHTNESS
ITS VERY RARE
WE CAN MEASURE THEIR MASSES
AND THESE TWO STARS WILL MERGE TOGETHER AS THEY LOSE ENERGY THROUGH GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION
WHICH ARE POTENTIALLY VERY RARE
WHEREAS THE AMATEUR COMMUNITY CAN HELP FOR THE ONES THAT ARE BRIGHT ENOUGH FOR THEM
A TRANSIENT EVENT HAPPENING IN THE SKY
AND EVEN IN SCHOOLS
WE PUBLISH IT TO OUR WEBSITE
YOU CAN VISIT OUR WEBSITE BBC CODE K SKY
THAT'S IT FOR THIS PROGRAMME
IN THE MEANTIME
IT IS BASICALLY A LOVE AFFAIR
SOMETIMES OF COURSE
THEY'RE NOT JUST COLD PIECES OF METAL
I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS
ANOTHER ONE CAME
I WOULDN'T BE HERE
MY MUM TAUGHT ME FROM WHEN I WAS SO KNEE HIGH TO A GRASSHOPPER HOW TO USE A MACHINE AND WHAT
I'D BEEN RECENTLY DIVORCED
AND IT GOES PING
SOME SORT OF CERAMIC OBJECTS
HALF DAY SATURDAYS
ONE MORNING I HAD THIS HANGOVER
BUT I HATE COLD CALLS
AND THAT IS TO ENTERTAIN THE MAHARAJAS AND THE ROYAL FAMILIES OF INDIA
WHEN THE INDIAN ROYAL FAMILIES WOULD COME OUT FROM THEIR PALACES AND THEY WOULD HAVE ENTERTAINMENT
I'M REALLY CONFUSED
BUT GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR SEARCH
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW
UM FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
AND WE'VE WE'VE NOT BEEN TOO BOLD
WE'VE SAID TWENTY TO FORTY
HE'S TOLD YOU I'M DEAD
MY STOMACH STILL HURTS FROM LAUGHING
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THE WAYS OF THE WORLD
NOT MY CUP OF TEA
I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE TO START
YOU CAN'T KEEP RUNNING AWAY FROM EVERYTHING YOU
HE'S ABLE TO TALK BACK
BUT THERES NO ANSWER
NOT EXAMINED IN ANY GREAT DETAIL
WHAT TIME DO YOU WANT ME
YOU UP MY COMMISSION BY FIVE
IT WOULD BE LOVELY BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
AND NOW FOR OUR NEXT VALUATION
I LOVE THE BEATLES
MADE IN ENGLAND
I'M SURE IT WILL SELL
YOU ARE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT
AND YOU'VE GOT AN EXAMPLE RIGHT DOWN HERE
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO RETURN BACK TO THE VALUATION DAY AND CATCH UP WITH OUR EXPERTS
I'VE SEEN THEM IN MUSEUM CABINETS AND I'VE SEEN THEM IN THE SUNDAY TIMES MAGAZINE WITH THE
LET'S TAKE THE COVER OFF
IT SHOULD CERTAINLY BE ON THE BACK
I LOVE TO SEE A BIT OF QUALITY
THE MAICA MARKET IS A VERY DIFFICULT ONE AT THE MOMENT
IT'S GONE UP AND DOWN
THERE IS ANOTHER SALE ON ANOTHER DAY
BRING IT ALONG TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS AND WE SEE WHAT WE CAN DO FOR YOU
DETAILS OF UP AND COMING DATES AND VENUES YOU CAN FIND ON OUR WEBSITE
DON'T MAKE OUT I'M THE ONLY ONE FELT SOMETHING
WHOLESALE GAS PRICES ARE MUCH LOWER THAN A YEAR AGO
A SERVICE FOR THREE POLICE OFFICERS KILLED IN TERROR ATTACKS IN PARIS
THEY'VE ALL BEEN AWARDED FRANCE'S HIGHEST HONOUR
THOUSANDS GATHERED AT A CEMETERY IN ISRAEL FOR THE FOUR PEOPLE KILLED IN A JEWISH SUPERMARKET
PRICES ARE RISING AT THEIR SLOWEST RATE ON RECORD
MUCH AS YOU ALWAYS LIGHT UP MY LIFE
AND WHY WOULD THAT BE
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT
HE WAS MY MENTOR
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH IN YOUR STAFF
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE
I THOUGHT WHEN I PICK A CAREER I'D PICK SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY MEANT I COULD SEE MY
NURSE CARTER FROM AA
THEY OFFERED TO LET ME TAKE EMMA WITH ME
IT WAS A BRILLIANT CALL
I AM STANDING OUT THERE IN FRONT OF THE PRESS READING A STATEMENT ABOUT CASES I KNOW BUER ALL
ARE YOU TWO GOING TO MAKE A GREAT TEAM
YOU MUST MAKE A GREAT TEAM TODAY
I THINK WE KNOW EACH OTHER WELL ENOUGH THAT WE KNOW OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES BUT
AND SINCE THEN I'VE JUST PLOUGHED ON WITH IT AND
I REALISED THAT THE CITY NEEDED SOME MORE NIGHTS
THE FIRST FEMALE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
BUT MY REAL LOVE IS CARDIOLOGY
I'D LOVE TO WORK TOWARDS MAYBE GETTING A JOB IN THAT FIELD IN THE NEAR FUTURE
SOME FIR CONES HAVE FALLEN FROM THE TREES
AND THIS BLOKE'S GONE AROUND AND GATHERED THEM UP
ISN'T THAT CHARMING
ALL THAT HISTORY
VERY SORT OF SIMPLE
BUT I NEED TO FIND OUT FIRST
BUT WE WON'T HAVE TO WAIT LONG
AND IT'S THE SORT OF THING WHICH
YOU SPENT VERY NICELY ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE
AND SHE IS A MIGHTY CANNY WOMAN
TO A BIRD ENTHUSIAST
A GOOD LOOKING BIRD
THAT THAT COULD TORPEDO THEIR CHANCES
YOU NINE PLUS SEVENTEEN
DRUGS DESTROYED SO MANY OF MY FRIENDS
WHERE SHE WAS LOVED
THE GOOD NEWS IS
SHE WAS SO HAPPY
IT'S TIME TO GET THE DOORS OPEN
GET THE SHOW ON THE ROAD AND AS THEY SAY
LET'S RAISE THE CURTAIN
GREAT WESTERN AUCTION ROOMS IN GLASGOW
LET'S HOPE THEY'RE GOING TO BE BIDDING ON OUR LOTS LATER ON
BUT BEFORE THE ACTION GETS UNDERWAY
LET'S HAVE A QUICK CHAT WITH TODAY'S AUCTIONEER EVERYBODY'S FAVOURITE
RUGGED LANDSCAPE BUT IT ALSO HIDES A WEALTH OF INVENTION
AND WHATEVER THE FIELD
IT'S ALIVE TODAY
AND IT'S STILL VERY MUCH THERE
I LOVE CHOCOLATE
VERY GOOD RESULT
THEY KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
SO IT'S A MUSCULAR
SORT OF PARCEL OF MEAT
WHICH HAS ALLOWED THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL DESPITE BEING SUCH A DELICIOUS MORSEL FOR PREDATORS
THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES
AND LONGER LASTING BLOOMS THAN PROBABLY EVER BEFORE
WE'RE GIVING THEM A WARMER WORLD THAT AMPS UP THEIR METABOLISM
WE HAVE RED BLOOD BECAUSE WE HAVE IRON AS PART OF OUR HAEMOGLOBIN STRUCTURE
BLUE BLOOD IS COMPOSED OF COPPER
INSTEAD OF IRON
IF YOU'VE EVER HAD A VACCINATION AND
AN INJECTION OF ANY KIND
I DIDN'T SEE ANY FLASHING LIGHTS
MAYBE THERE'S LOW FOG IN THE AREA
AND IT MAKES A SMALL LIGHT SEEM LIKE A MUCH LARGER LIGHT
WHERE THE CAMERAS WERE AIMED
AS SOON AS THE PRESSURE BUILDS UP IN THE BEDROCK
YOUR GOAL IS TO GIVE AWAY YOUR SPERM AS READILY AS POSSIBLE TO AS MANY PARTNERS AS YOU CAN
OVER A PERIOD OF MILLENNIA
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED BY THEM
AND THE PLACE TO BE
THEY'RE JUST LOW ENOUGH BENEATH THE FS LINE TO STOP THE SNAKES FROM FREEZING TO DEATH WHILST THEY'RE
THE STINGRAY OLYMPICS
OR BECAUSE THEY CAN BUT
WE CAN SEE THE WORLD
AND OUR PLACE IN IT
IN A COMPLETELY NEW LIGHT
BUT WHEN YOU GOT THERE
BUT NO ONE IN HER FAMILY
TREATING AN ANOREXIC IS A MINEFIELD
DO YOU THINK I'D LET YOU COME IN AND DESTROY IT
WE WELCOMED YOU TO OUR HOUSE
TO OUR COMMUNITY
YOU MET HER YESTERDAY
WE ARE SAVING THEM
IS IN COLCHESTER
A WONDERFUL OLD VICTORIAN BUILDING
BECAUSE WE'RE COMING TO AN AREA VERY NEAR YOU SOON
THE CHINESE PLAQUE CAME IN
IT WAS A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE
AND IT REALLY DID THE PLAS OUT OF WORK
I'M REALLY MEAN
HERE ON THE HIGH STREET
IT'S UP TO US TO PROTECT THEM AND PROMOTE THEM
THE GUYS OUT THERE THAT WORK WITH THEIR HANDS
RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME TO SAY FAREWELL TO THE TOWN HALL IN COLCHESTER
THAT'S FOR SURE
JUST A FEW YEARS AGO
WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT ON EARTH IS HAPPENING WITH THESE WEIRD NATURAL
SORT MYTHICAL MONSTERS RISING FROM THE DEEP TO WREAK HAVOC
JUST FROM KNOWING HER PAST HISTORY
BUT WHAT ABOUT A SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE NO MALES
WHICH WAS A BIT SURPRISING
AGAIN WE CAN IDENTIFY IT TO SPECIES LEVEL
YOU WANT TO FIND ME
AND ITS FEED IS BACTERIA
AS A SORT OF LAST DITCH EFFORT TO KEEP THE POPULATION GOING
SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION OF MUSEUM SPECIMENS SHOW THAT IT'S BEEN KNOCKING AROUND SINCE THE
NO ONE KNOWS WHY IT'S CAUSING THIS HORRENDOUS OUTBREAK RIGHT NOW
AND THE SAME PRAIRIE DOGS PRODUCED A NEW SOUND A NEW WORD
SOME SCIENTISTS NOW BELIEVE THAT THE MOST SOPHISTICATED IS NOT FOUND IN OTHER PRIMATES OR EVEN THE
AND NORWICH IS ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD FOR THAT
SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT
WE DON'T HAVE A SHOPPING LIST
BUT EXACTLY HOW MANY OF THOSE NOTES WILL THEY SPEND
AND I'D LIKE YOU TO GO UP WITH THEM
LET'S TAKE A SNEAKY PEEK AT WHAT'S COMING UP
YOU'RE SERVING A RATHER INTERESTING APPRENTICESHIP
POUND I DON'T THINK THAT'S EXPENSIVE
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT
AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT
A WOMAN ON A STALL DOWN THERE WAS ON HOLIDAY IN FLORIDA
AND THIS MEGAPHONE DATES FROM NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO HEAD OFF TO THE AUCTION
LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
THREE ITEMS IN THE BAG
BUT YOU ALWAYS WERE ENIGMATIC
WE'RE GOING TO CHECK OUT HOW THE BLUE TEAM GOT ON
THEN IT'LL IT'LL MAKE IT
LET THE MARKET DECIDE
AND IF IT GOES AGAINST THEM
ALL THE MONEY YOU GAVE ME
LET'S CHECK OUT WITH THE AUCTIONEER WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT CATHERINE'S GOPHERING IRON SET
GOOD LUCK TODAY
BUT IT'S JUST A BIT LATE
WE ARE VICTIMS OF OUR OWN SUCCESS
THAT IS A SHAME
TELL ME HIS NAME
THIS IS THE QUIZ SHOW WHERE THEY DON'T COME ON TO WIN BIG PRIZES THEY DO IT FOR THE GLORY
AND YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON TWITTER
THANKS FOR WATCHING
THERE'S BEEN AN EXPLOSION IN THE POPULARITY OF MICROBREWERIES IN THIS COUNTRY
SO A BIT MORE COMPLEXITY
YOU GET THE THE INITIAL CHO NOTES AND SOME VANILLA
AND THEN HE BRINGS IN SOME OF THE MORE TART AND CHERRY CHARACTERS AS IT
PUT THEM INTO BOXES
IT'S IT'S A SENSE OF COMMUNITY
WOULD BE OF THIS QUALITY OR POSSIBLY EVEN LESS
IT'S A WINE AND CHEESE PARTY
BECAUSE IT'S A BIT LIKE MAKING A SCONE
IT'S ALL ABOUT TEXTURE
AMONGST HIS MANY CRIMES
I SUSPECT HE KNOWS A LITTLE MORE ABOUT MEDICINE THAN A CLOTH MERCHANT'S WIFE
OR LOSE YOUR HEAD
HE'S ABLE TO TALK BACK
DON'T MAKE OUT I'M THE ONLY ONE FELT SOMETHING
I WAS TOO SOFT WITH HIM
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THAT
WHICH IS QUITE COOL
BUT I THINK BECAUSE IT'S A TOURIST AREA
YOU'LL ONLY FIND THE CRAFT IN A FEW AREAS
ONE OF THEM IS SHROPSHIRE ON THE ENGLISH WELSH BOARD
AND THIS LITTLE CRAFT WILL ACTUALLY HOLD THREE TIMES MY BODY WEIGHT
I THINK AT AUCTION
IT MIGHT EXCEED FORTY TO SIXTY
WE' GOT OUT OF THE OAK ROOM THERE WHERE IT'S ALL GOING ON
ROBIN AND KATHLEEN'S EMU EGG REALLY STOLE THE SHOW FOR ME
DO HOPE THAT GOES BACK TO AUSTRALIA
JOIN US AGAIN SOON FOR MANY MORE SURPRISES
HOW DO YOU MEAN DANGER WELL I MEAN
DESPERATE TIMES NEED DESPERATE MEASURES
WITHOUT YOU IN CHARGE
IF ANYONE SHOULD TAKE CHARGE
THE POLICE SHOULD
AND I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU
I SHALL RELINQUISH THE CONTROL
YOU'RE LAUGHING AT ME
MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY BIG DECISION FOR YOU
WE CAN FIND YOU A BED HERE TONIGHT
ASK PEOPLE FOR DONATIONS YOU KNOW
IF YOU TAKE THAT LONELINESS AWAY FROM IT
AND HE SHOULD BE WORTH NOW
WHICH MAKES IT EASY TO THINK THAT
I JUST WISH MY DAD HAD KNOWN THAT
CALM SPECIALIST TEAM RECEIVED OVER FORTY
COLLECTING CAN BE AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE CAUGHT IN YOUR YOUTH
AS HE CALLED THEM
THE ENTREPRENEURS WANTED TO FIND SOME WAY OF ENTERTAINING THEM AND INDEED
MAKING MONEY FROM THEM
RAGING MONSTERS PREPARING TO WREAK DESTRUCTION ON EVERY SIDE
BUT BIGGER THAN ANY THAT HAD GONE BEFORE
MASONS MODEL HAS INSPIRED ME TO GO OUT AND EXPLORE THE COUNTRYSIDE
WE NEED TO SOLVE THE RECRUITMENT CRISIS AND
FIND A SYSTEM WE CAN AFFORD
IS THAT POSSIBLE
AND VERY OFTEN IMMEDIATELY
IT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO DO THE JOBS
SIBLINGS AS WELL
WHEN THEY COME HERE
THEY RELATE TO US HOW
HOW PEOPLE DEVELOP AND THE STORIES THEY TELL YOU ABOUT
BUT YOU CAN STILL GET YOUR HANDS ON ONE
FIFTY AND AT LEAST FOUR POUNDS FROM THE SALE OF EVERY CALENDAR WILL GO TO CHILDREN IN NEED
YOU HAVE TO BE PAID SOMETHING TO EARN YOUR LIVING
AS A MAGICAL GROUP
AND STILL HAVE IN IN MANY PARTS OF RURAL HIGHLAND
IS REALLY NOT SUSTAINABLE
DOCTORS NOW TRAIN TO BE PART OF TEAMS AND THEY TRAIN TO WORK SHIFTS
PLACES LIKE AUSTRALIA AND CANADA HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS PROVIDING RURAL HEALTHCARE
THEY OFFER APPLICANTS TO MEDICAL SCHOOL WHO HAVE A RURAL BACKGROUND PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT
IF YOU LIVE SOMEWHERE LIKE THIS
THEY CAN'T GO ON THE WAY THEY ARE
BUT IN THE FUTURE
ALL THOSE INVOLVED
THEY WERE NOT SO KEEN ON PRAYING FOR LONG TIMES
IN WRITTEN REFERENCES
HIS PART OF IT WAS TO BRING TOGETHER ALL THE LAWS ACROSS WHEELS AND TO CODIFY THEM UNDER ONE CENTRAL
YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW
WE'RE GOING TO BE UP IN THE HIGHLANDS
I WOULDN'T GIVE
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN ALL THIS STUFF WE BOUGHT
LIKE GOING DOWN WITH ALL HANDS
AND FOR THIS SENSATIONAL OFFER
DOGS COVER THEIR EYES
IT WAS IN TROUSERS
LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY
THE SOONER HE'S OUT
BUT WEVE COME HERE WITH A MISSION AND THAT MISSION
IS TO EXPLORE THE ADAPTATIONS
THIS IS HOW THEY DO IT
BECAUSE IT IS A BIT OF A WALK
AND WERE GOING TO BE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THE WILDLIFE THAT YOU CAN SEE AROUND THE COAST IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS
GALE FORCE WINDS
DOING A LIVE SHOW
THE WINDS GOT TO NINETY SIX MILES AN HOUR
BUT WHAT ABOUT KEEPING WARM WELL
AND AT MINUS FOUR DEGREES
AND IT'S THAT THAT CAUSES THE DAMAGE
IT ONLY HAS TO BE POINT
BLUE IS STAYING WITH US FOR THIS WEEK
MAYBE SOME OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES AS WE GO THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY
THE COLD WEATHER STAYING WITH US
THE RISK OF SOME MORE SLEET AND SNOW
KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR BIRD FEEDERS
THIS IS LAST YEAR'S WEATHER
THIS IS MORE LIKE IT
FREEZING MORE SNOW TO COME
WE ASK THE COURT TO PLACE LIZZIE CRADOCK IN OUR CARE
HE'S NOT WORKING
THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY
AND THEY'RE BEING VERY DECISIVE
IT IS NOW RAINING
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
A FAMILY OF FOUR
AH IT'S FINALLY OPENED
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN MANAGE
WHAT SHE'S GOOD AT AT SCHOOL
WHICH REQUIRES TRAINING
BUT APART FROM A MEDICAL RESPONSIBILITIES
MEDICAL TRAINING CAN ONLY GET YOU SO FAR
MY HUSBAND'S AN EMERGENCY PLUMBER
HE COULD BE OUT ALL HOURS
I WAS BUILDING THE PART UP BEFORE
THEY ARE SILVER
IT'S GOT A GOOD PROVENANCE ANYWAY
EXACTLY IF SOMEONE SAID
SHE'S ON HOLIDAY
IN THE COUNTRY AREAS FARMERS
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THE SHOW
WHAT ABOUT THE SOUNDS
SOMEONES JUST BASHED INTO YOU IN THE DARK
BUT IT IS ALSO OUT THERE IN THE DAYTIME
SO THEY CAN BE VERY NEGATIVELY INFLUENCED BY SNOW
TOO MUCH KNOW ROBIN FATALITY
BUT THE MALES ON THAT ACCOUNT WILL DRIVE THE FEMALES OUT AND MAINTAIN THE FOOD SOURCES
THEMSELVES SO WE THINK THIS IS A GROUP OF MALE ROBINS THAT HAVE MONOPOLISED THE CARCASS
AND THAT'S ENOUGH TO NUDGE THE SPECIES INTO DESPERATION
OUR INTREPID MARTIN COVERED HIMSELF IN SNOW TO DEMONSTRATE HOWALMIGANS SURVIVE
BUT TO EXPLORE THE LIFESTYLES OF THE ANIMALS THAT LIVE HERE THROUGHOUT THIS HARSH WINTER SO
SO WE ARE INTERESTED IN THEIR PHYSIOLOGY
BECAUSE THIS TIME OF YEAR
ALL THE THINGS THAT ALLOW THEM TO PROSPER HERE THROUGHOUT THIS VERY VERY TOUGH TIME
EVEN IN YOUR BACK GARDEN
THEY ARE DOING IT RIGHT NOW
YOU GOT TO SEE THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE
IN THIS COUNTRY
IT' IS PARTLY BECAUSE WE ASSOCIATE IT WITH CHRISTMAS BUT ALSO ITS THE ONLY MERIOLOGICAL EVENT THAT
AND LET'S START WITH THE BIG ONE
WHEN I WAS A KID
DESPITE THE COLD WEATHER
IT HAS NEVER BEEN FILMED BEFORE
SO IT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED CULTURALLY
BUT OF COURSE WHEN IT COMES TO EXPOSURE THERE IS MORE THAN JUST TEMPERATURE
GET DOWN AND GO AND LOOK AT THE WILDLIFE
AMAZING THAT YOU CAN SEE FIVE SPECIES OF BRITISH OWL
PEOPLE WELCOME IT
IN FACT ITS NOW ONE OF OUR BRITISH SPECIES
THIS IS A SPECIES WHICH HAS COLONISED THIS COUNTRY
THE BIG QUESTION IS
HAS IT RE COLONISED THE COUNTRY
AND WE HAVE LEARNED TO LIKE IT OVER THE LAST ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS
THESE HAVE TURNED UP
AND IN CERTAIN PLACES
THEY TAKE OTHER BIRDS OUT OF THEIR NEST THEY
AND THEN WE HAVE OTHER NONNATIVE SPECIES WHICH ARE INTRODUCED DELIBERATELY EVERY YEAR
AND EVERYONE TOLERATES THAT
AND WE WANTED TO FILM THEM AND
WEVE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO FILMING THEM
THEN WE PUT IN FILM CAMERAS
YOU MIGHT EXPECT SUCCESSFUL OPPORTUNISTIC ANIMALS TO BE BOLD AND GO STRAIGHT IN
THINGS LIKE CROWS AND WOLVES AND FOXES
WE GOING TO CARRY ON FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS
THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE LIVE IN TOWNS AND CITIES
I WILL ALWAYS CARE
YOU CAN'T CHANGE ANY OF IT
ARTHUR HAD THEM READY
I SAW THEM TOGETHER
HE'S ON THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE FOR THE BRITISH PAEDIATRICS COUNCIL
WHEN I SAW WHAT HE WAS DOING
THAT IS BANG OUT OF ORDER
BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE GIRLS
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE
BUT FOR QUITE A WHILE
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO RESERVE AND IT'S MY FAVOURITE LOT OF THE DAY
WHAT WOULD WE LIKE TO SEE
MAYBE THEY'D MAKE ONE CURRY FOR THAT DAY
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING RID OF IT
THE VICTORIAN SILVER CARD CASE
BELONGING TO SHEILA
THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE DAY
SELLING FOR A WHOPPING ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY
WELL OVER ITS ORIGINAL ESTIMATE
WINTER ISN'T JUST ABOUT SCOTLAND
THE FORECAST IS FOR COLD WEATHER OVER THE WHOLE OF THE UK THIS WEEK
SO SOME OF YOU ARE ALSO SHIVERING AS MUCH AS WE ARE
SO WE'VE BEEN OUT AROUND THE UK
HE VISITED THE RSPB'S RESERVE AT SNETTISHAM TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED AFTER DARK IN AMONGST
AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING I'M BEING
YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO MISS IT
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S ANYTHING TO DO WITH EYESIGHT
THEY ARE NOT ALL EATEN BY BIRDS
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER AMERICAN INVADER THAT HAS ARRIVED IN THE UK AND HAS BROUGHT ANOTHER DISEASE
IT'S AN AQUATIC ONE
AND I WENT TO ONE OF THE WORST AFFECTED WATERCOURSES IN THE UK TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT
AND HE THINKS THAT THE MALE AND THE FEMALE WILL FIGHT OVER FOOD IN THE WINTERTIME
EVEN AT THIS POINT
NOW SO THEY WILL PROTECT THEIR TERRITORY
BACK TO CHRIS AND MICHAELA
BIRDS ARE THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE
THAT'S WHAT ILL SAY ABOUT THAT
AND THESE CAN BLOW BIRDS MILES OFF COURSE
DO ALL RODENTS HIBERNATE
WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FEED
SO WE THOUGHT WE' SET THE RODENT HERE A LITTLE TEST
A FOOD TRIAL TO SEE WHICH FOOD THEY WOULD CHOOSE
THE MICE CAME OUT TO PLAY
WILL THEY GO FOR THE CHEESE
RICHARD TAYLOR JONES
I MEANT TO BEGIN YESTERDAY
ONLY COOK HADN'T BEEN TOLD
WON'T YOU EVEN HAVE A FINGER SANDWICH
OR WHATEVER IT'S CALLED WITH MEN
I DIDN'T KNOW MY CHARLIE WHEN WE MARRIED
THE TARADAM IS FULL OF HOLES
NOT CONTENT WITH TRYING TO PALM ME OFF ON THE SPOON MAKER'S SON
THEY WOULD SUFFER THE SEVEN SULPHURS OF HELL TO PROTECT THAT WHICH THEY
I MADE IT QUITE CLEAR TO LAURENCE THAT WHEN I USED THE WORD LOVE IN THE WEDDING VOWS
HE SHOULD MENTALLY REPLACE IT WITH LIKE
ONE WHO REFUSES TO BE PASSED LIKE CHATTEL FROM FATHER TO SPOUSE
MY NAME IS SMOOTH
AND CAN SHE NOT
I FOLLOWED A TRAIL OF BROKEN TWIGS AND DISTURBED LEAVES AND THE SCENT OF
EXERCISE FREE WILL IN LOVE
MY MOUTH PARCHES
IT WAS ONE OF THE MANY QUALITIES I ADMIRED
THE OTHERS BEING PUNCTUALITY
IF LOVE IS A CRIME
BUT I WANTED TO GO TO THAT ARCHITECTURAL SALVAGE YARD ON THE WAY TO LICHFIELD
EXCELLENT AIRWAY MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE
DON'T YOU WORRY
AND MY FINAL THOUGHT
PROBABLY AROUND FIVE
WE'RE LOOKING AT AROUND
WE NEED SOME ANTIQUES TO SELL
AND WE SETTLED HERE THEN
THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY VERY FUSSY
IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND I THINK TWO TO FIVE YEARS AGO
TO HOLD THE TRIPOD BASE ON
WERE TAKEN OFF TO MAKE IT INTO THIS
REMEMBER PAM'S LITTLE OCCASIONAL TABLE
I KNOW THING OR TWO ABOUT HOW THEY WORK
ROUND ABOUT TWO TO THREE HUNDRED
IT CERTAINLY WAS A MIXED DAY
YOU CAN NEVER PREDICT THE RESULT
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED WATCHING THE SHOW
BUT PLEASE WILL YOU JUST TELL ME
I JUMPED ON TO A RATHER STORMY FERRY AND WENT OVER TO INVESTIGATE
WELL WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FILM DAY AND NIGHT AND GATHER TOGETHER THAT CAST OF CHARACTERS
THAT IS THE OTTER
OVER A PERIOD OF DAYS
THE MICE AND VOLES ARE RUNNING AROUND
THE FIRST ANIMAL TRAS THAT WE LOOKED AT WERE THIS FORMATION HERE
A BIT LIKE A CAT
WHAT DO YOU THINK
BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS LITTLE CHAP
SO THE SKULL GETS SMALLER AND INSIDE THAT THE BRAIN SHRINKS
SO WHAT ABOUT THAT
THE OLD MYTH HAS BEEN DEBUNKED
THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD THING
WE CERTAINLY HAVE
EVEN AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
SUCH AN IMPORTANT HABITAT
SO IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO ANYTHING THIS YEAR IN YOUR GARDEN
A NEW PHENOMENA
ALL THE DETAILS ONCE AGAIN ARE ON THE WEBSITE
IT WILL BE FOR THE WILDLIFE
SET THE ALARM GET UP EARLY
IF YOU STILL GOT BERRIES
WE FOUND OUT THAT THE RED SQUIRRELS WERE MORE CURIOUS THAN THE GUYS
THEY WERE GETTING TOO TIGHT
ALL THIS DEMENTED OLD LADY STUFF
SHE REMEMBERS LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY
SOON AS SHE COULD SLIP OFF
I WANT YOU TO HELP ME
AFTER THE ANLOS
GERMAN PLANES CAME
ALL THREE OF US
I DON'T WANT TO DIE
I ALSO SPEAK GERMAN
I'M A LITTLE BIT BROKE
IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY FOR ME TO JOIN YOU AND CAN WE MAKE A LIVING
THEY WILL PAY COMMISSION FOR TAKING YOU THERE
I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT
BUT I DIDN'T CONSIDER MYSELF
MORE OR LESS LAUGHING OF MYSELF
THAT'S A HEAD OF A JEW BECAUSE WE WERE AH WE WERE TAUGHT HOW TO RECOGNISE
BUT QUITE FAR AWAY
IT BECAME EVEN STRONGER
AND WHEN THEY SAW I WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT
IT WAS SO PAINFUL
THIS IS A FALSE PAPERS
YOU DON'T EVER ASK THAT QUESTION BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER
I GAVE THEM THE NAME OF MY PARENTS
YOU WILL HAVE TO ANSWER
WHEN I WALKED IN FRONT
AND I SAW THAT HE WAS HIDING THAT PIECE OF BREAD
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS WAS
I DON'T THINK SO
AND I WAS THERE IN AUSCHWITZ BUT
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
AND NATURALLY I TOLD THEM
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET THAT RIGHT
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT OUTSIDE
AND THEN YOU RISE ABOVE IT ALL
SO LOTS TO PLAY FOR
THANKS FOR WATCHING
I'M JUST NOT A BIG FAN OF
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO MAKE THEM SPECIAL
IF I HAD A TOP DRAWER ONE LIKE THIS
BUT YOU MAKE ME LOOK GOOD
I THINK OKAY FOR VERY DIFFERENT THINGS
LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY
AH THE SOONER HE'S OUT
PICK UP THEM SCISSORS AND KEEP GOING
WE WERE ALL LINED UP
SHE WAS THERE AS WELL
I PUSHED HIM AWAY
I LET MY GUARD DOWN
BUT PLEASE WILL YOU JUST TELL ME
THEY WERE GETTING TOO TIGHT
BE MARRIED TO YOU
ALL THIS DEMENTED OLD LADY STUFF
SHE REMEMBERS LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY
SOON AS SHE COULD SLIP OFF
THE FIRST PEOPLE YOU WOULD TURN TO FOR HELP ARE YOUR PARENTS
THEY DIDN'T SUPPORT HIM
CHURCHILL WAS JUST TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD WHEN HE ENTERED HERE
WHAT HE CARED ABOUT WAS WHAT HE BELIEVED IN AND WHAT HE BELIEVED IN
CHURCHILL PRACTISED HIS SPEECHES
THEY SUPPORTED THE GOVERNMENTS POLICY OF DISARMAMENT AND APPEASEMENT
THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN
HIS VICTORY SIGN
IS THE PITVILLE PUMP ROOM
OUR VENUE FOR OUR VALUATION DAY
THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME
WELL I THINK IT'S A BOOMING SUCCESS
IN MY EXPERIENCE
NEEDLESS TO SAY
ONE MAN REALISED THAT MANY OF THESE SO CALLED SPIRIT RAISERS WERE FAKES AND HE MADE IT HIS MISSION
MANY WOULD FLOCK HERE JUST TO TAKE THE WATERS
HOPING IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH
THE MOTOR CAR WAS SEEN ON THE STREET FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME AND GENERALLY PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO BELIEVE
MASCULINE DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA
MUSIC BEING PLAYED
THEY WERE SCIENTISTS
BUT GRADUALLY THE THE FAME SPREAD
APPARENTLY FROM GHOSTS THAT THEY'D SUMMONED
UP AND AT THE END OF THE ACT
HE WAS AT THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA WHERE SCIENCE AND
HE DIDN'T TRAVEL MUCH OUT OF THE UK
SO HE WASN'T INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN
SO IN KEEPING WITH THAT TRADITION
RIGHT BACK TO SAXON TIMES
THE LAST OF KING HENRY THE EIGHTH'S SIX WIVES
SHE WAS KNOWN TO BE INTELLIGENT
CAN WE GO HOME NOW
I'M BACK AT HALF PAST ELEVEN ON THE DOT
THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU
WE DIDN'T SHARE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR NAME IS
I WERE UP FEEDING BABY
SOMEBODY WERE MOVING ABOUT
IF I TURNED THEM ON
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE THIS
IT'S FROM MY LOCAL IDIOT
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
DON'T GIVE ME LOVE YA
I THINK I MARRIED ONE
I NEED A SMALL FRUIT LOAF
I COULD GO OFF ANY MINUTE
LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT NOW
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR ARKWRIGHT
I'VE BROUGHT DOWN MANY A TEMPERATURE
WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS SHOW
CAME HOME STONE DEAD LAST
WE DECIDED WE WOULD RERUN THE RACE
BECAUSE WE'D ALREADY DONE LONDON
WE STAGED A RACE ACROSS LONDON
BICYCLE AND A SPEEDBOAT
DOWN THE RIVER THAMES
HAS BEEN BUSTED BY ONE OF THEM
IN POLYESTER TROUSERS
THEY'VE ALL GOT JAMMED UP ROADS
WHAT'S YOUR MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME
WHILE WE AND THE CAMERAS MOVE OVER THERE
OUT OF COCKNEY REBEL
I'VE HAD SOME GOOD TIMES NO
NOW THERE ARE MANY
MANY WELL KNOWN EDS IN THE WORLD THESE DAYS
THAT'S A RIDICULOUS BUSINESS PLAN
THE SECOND HALF OF MY LIFE IS MUCH MORE FUN THAN THE FIRST HALF AND I'D RATHER THAT WAY ROUND
I THINK IT IS VERY
IF IF IF THERE WASN'T A PLACE TO STAY
IT WAS TOO LATE FOR ME TO CALL ANYONE FOR A SOFA
FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER
AND WHEN WE LEFT THE ACTION
JEREMY WAS IN THE LEAD
CAN YOU INTERPRET
IF WE GIVE YOU A LIFT TO WORK
I WOULD HAVE WON THAT BY TWENTY MINUTES
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR CASH TO BUILD THEIR BUSINESSES
BUT ONLY IN THE BEST
COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S SHOW
PEOPLE WEAR HEELS ON GRASS
IT IS A CHEAP PRODUCT ANYWAY
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
I'M SURE I'LL SEE PEOPLE WEARING THESE VARIOUS EVENTS
BUT BUT FOR THE THE OLD SORT OF HANGING
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS
BUT IT DOES SEEM TO BE WORN MORE AND MORE OFTEN THESE DAYS
OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEUR
HAS BUILT A HIGH VIS CLOTHING BUSINESS ON THE BACK OF HER PASSION FOR HORSE RIDING
IF IT WAS ILLEGAL
I LOVE DESIGNING
I CAN DO THIS FOR QUESTIONS
BECAUSE I'M EQUESTRIAN THROUGH AND THROUGH
I WAS SO EXCITED
WHAT WE FIND WITH THIS
EXCEPT SOMETIMES YOU CAN IF YOU DO IT BETTER
OR WITH A TWIST
WITH THAT IN MIND
WITH HANDSHAKES ON DEALS WORTH TWO HUNDRED
NOW THOUGH THE REALLY HARD WORK BEGINS
THE TASK OF MAKING THOSE BUSINESSES A SUCCESS
YOU CAN JOIN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT ALL OF TONIGHT'S PITCHES ON TWITTER
I KNOW WHAT WE SAID
YOU'RE MORE IMPORTANT
READ ME THE RIOT ACT
WITHOUT BEING CHEAP
THAT'S THE OTHER REASON I'M HERE
NOW YOU'RE GOING TOO FAR
OR IT WAS BRONZED
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL JUST GET AWAY AT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS BUT
TOO BIG FOR YOUR HOUSE
AND THERE'S SOME THOUGHT THAT
WHEN THE RUSSIANS LAUNCHED PUTNIK ONE
THE CORE COLLAPSES DOWN UNDER GRAVITY TELL IT ABOUT THE SIZE OF MANCHESTER
TWENTY KILOMETRES ACROSS
AFI MEANS WELL
THANKS FOR NOTHING
THIS TIME OF THE MORNING
AND RUNS A TECHNO NIGHT
GOT VIP TREATMENT ALL NIGHT
HE WON'T TALK TO ME
I NEED TO CALL STELLA
I COULDN'T SWIM
I'VE GOT A SEVEN YEAR OLD COUSIN THAT I'VE NOT EVEN MET AND ALL THIS TIME
AND YOU'VE BEEN JUST UP THE ROAD
IF THEY ARE HAVING AN AFFAIR THEN
RATHER THAN TELL HER THE TRUTH CAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT EMBARRASSING
THEN DRESSED IN A GORILLA SUIT AND CHAINED TO RAILINGS
AFTER WHAT BRYANT SAID
YOU'RE YOU'RE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK
YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS
I THOUGHT WE'D DONE THIS
I'M SAM NAZ WITH YOUR NINETY SECOND UPDATE
GARY GLITTER'S BEEN GIVING EVIDENCE AT HIS TRIAL
THE FIRM DENIED HACKERS WERE BEHIND IT
I WILL TALK TO HER IF YOU WILL SHUT UP
I JUST KNOW I WANTED HIM TO STOP SHOUTING AT ME
I SEE THE POINT
FIRST THINGS FIRST
YOU HAVE CHANGED
I WAS STILL DOING MY JOB
AS A MATTER OF FACT
HE SAID HIS NAME WAS JOSEF
IT LASTED ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE DAYS SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY I'M STILL ALIVE
I WAS AN EXTREMELY FIT FELLOW
EVERY TIME I GO ON A HOUSE CALL
I PROMISE TO RESTORE SELF RESPECTC IN SCHOOLS
SO THAT PEOPLE GROW UP TO BE HONEST
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION
IF I AM ELECTED
I'M AFRAID THAT IS A MATTER FOR CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
SO GOOD EVENING
WOMEN OF BANBURY
NOT SPLENDID AT ALL
INCONVENIENT AND IRRITATING
THEY INTEND TO DISRUPT MY DINNER TONIGHT
AH MORE MONEY A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT PAY RISE
I HAVE SELECTED PALE
HOLDING A BALL BEARING
I KNOW MY SPEECH IS VERY IMPORTANT AND AFFECTING BUT
I DON'T TOUCH THE STUFF
WE HAVE SANDWICHES
THE RUBBER BARONS
WITH THOSE EMINENT MEN
AND THE ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD
YOU ARE EXTRAORDINARY
WHERE IT IS USUALLY KEPT
I WAS FORCED TO SLEEP
HUDDLED AND BLANKETLESS
YOU HAVE TOUCHED MY HEART TODAY
I'M TICKETY BOO
BUT YOULL NEVER KNOW WHEN THINGS MAY TAKE A TURN FOR THE WORSE
I'M A BIT LIKE A SWAN
YOU ALWAYS COME HERE THE LAST THURSDAY IN THE MONTH
BY THE POWERS INVESTED IN ME
BUT I RANG HER IN THE EVENING TO FIND OUT HOW WE'D DONE
I SHALL GO BACK TO MY ONE BEDROOM FLAT
I CAN CURE THAT
ALL THE YEARS I'VE LIVED IN A ONE BEDROOM FLAT
IF I COULD LIVE ON CHAMPAGNE AND PEANUTS
WE ONLY TRULY BECOME RICH WHEN WE LEARN HOW TO GIVE
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE
WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO FIND OUT
BECAUSE IT'S AUCTION TIME ON THE ROSTRUM
I TOOK THIS PAINTING IN
I'M A DOG LOVER
LET'S HOPE THAT RINGS TRUE
WE'VE GOT TWO TO THREE HUNDRED POUNDS VALUATION PUT ON THIS
BUT IT REALLY IS A ROLLS ROYCE VERSION
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY
AND THIS IS THE ASHTON MEMORIAL
WHICH IS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY
DESPITE ALL THIS WORK
BECAUSE THAT ONE TOOK SO LONG FOR HIM TO DO
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK
WHAT'S HER NAME
TREVOR GRIMSHAW PAINTINGS
SOMETHING WORTH INVESTING IN SO
I'M NOT GOING TO COME
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES ONCE IN A WHILE
BUT IT MAY HARM YOUR DEFENCE IF YOU DO NOT MENTION
THE NUMBER OF UNDERPERFORMING SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND DOUBLED LAST YEAR
IT'S AFTER GOVERNMENT CHANGES DESIGNED TO MAKE THE EXAM SYSTEM MORE RIGOROUS
SOME HEADS SAY LEAGUE TABLES ARE NOW A MESS
HE'S THROUGH TO THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN FINAL
DIPPY THE DIPLODOCUS HAS GREETED VISITORS AT LONDON'S NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM FOR DECADES
NOW HE'S RETIRING
FOUR CONTENDERS ARE COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THESE OPENING ROUNDS FOR
PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
THANKS FOR WATCHING
SHE WENT ON ABOUT BEING MARRIED
SHE WAS TRYING TO STAY FAITHFUL
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THAT'S WHAT RAPE IS
SHE DIDN'T ASK ME TO STOP
VERY POOR PLACE
WHEN IT COMES TO FLAVOUR
FLIING WITH THE CUSTOMERS JUST TO GET THEM TO SIGN YOUR SPONSORSHIP FORM
HE WON'T TALK TO ME IN EMMA'S FUNERAL TOMORROW
AFI MEANS WELL
THANKS FOR NOTHING
AFTER WHAT BRYANT SAID
YOU'RE YOU'RE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK
THE TUED EX SHE DIDN'T WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH
YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS
I THOUGHT WE'D DONE THIS
THE LAST TIME WE'LL EVER GET MARRIED SO
I'M NOT GOING TO COME
BUT IT MAY HARM YOUR DEFENCE IF YOU DO NOT MENTION
SHE WENT ON ABOUT BEING MARRIED
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SHE DIDN'T ASK ME TO STOP
IS IN COLCHESTER
EVEN IF IT'S NOT THE REAL THING
VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE
SO WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT IT IN TODAY
YOU HAVE TO AGREE
THAT'S BEEN TURNED FROM ONE PIECE OF WOOD
KEEPING UP WITH THE DEMAND
FOUR GENERATIONS OF HEDGES MADE CLOCKS HERE IN THE TOWN
THEY GOT MARRIED
UM SPANNING A PERIOD WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS
YOU COULD SAY THAT'S A WELL RUN FAMILY BUSINESS
THE CULTURES TO CLOCKMAKERS SUPPLIED CLOCKS TO PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE LAND
I GUESS WE HAVE TO THANK BERNARD MASON
A WONDERFUL OLD VICTORIAN BUILDING
WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU
IM JUST GOING TO SAY TO YOU
BUT YESTERDAY I HAD A QUICK CHAT TO JAMES GRI
YOU HAD A LOCAL
THAT'S AS GOOD AS IT GETS
THE CHINESE PLAQUE CAME IN
IT WAS A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE
I'M REALLY MEAN
THAT'S FOR SURE
AT LEAST THEY'RE OUT OF THE WAY OUT THERE
WATCH OUT FOR IT
PICK UP THIS ROAD HERE
NOW WHEN YOU PUT IT TO SLEEP
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
WE'VE FOUND TWO SETS WHO ARE MOUNTAIN FRIENDLY
THEY GET TO KEEP IT
SHE HAS A PRICE
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO
THE EXPERTS TOO WILL BE TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING TO BOOST THEIR TEAM'S PROFITS
I THINK WE OUGHT TO SEE ANYTHING FROM TEN TO PERHAPS TWENTY
I'M SELLING AT EIGHTY TWO POUND
WE'RE NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT
YOU HAD PLUS TEN PLUS FIVE
DON'T SEE THAT ON THE MARKET SO VERY OFTEN
CREAM EVERYWHERE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF
BUT ALSO A PLACE WHERE KIDS CAN STAY
I THINK I LIKE HER AS A PERSON
I THINK IT'S JUST GOING TO FEEL VERY BOUDOIRISH AND VERY SPECIAL TO THEM
HOW ARE WE GOING TO PUT THESE TWO VERY DIFFERENT STYLES INTO ONE ROOM
AND YOU'VE GOT TO GO FORWARD
AND I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE UP INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALLY
YOU CAN FIND IT RIGHT HERE
THEY SAY YOU NEVER FORGET WHERE YOU WERE WHEN YOU HEARD ABOUT A MAJOR EVENT
THE MOON LANDINGS
OR THE CHANGES IN DATES
WE HAD TO MOVE THE WEDDING A FEW WEEKS LATER
THE NEXT BIG ONE BATTLE OF WATERLOO
OR THE DEATH OF A NOTABLE PERSON
AND HIS PUBLICITY MACHINE WAS FANTASTIC
LORD NELSON DIED IN THAT BATTLE
THESE EVENTS ARE A GOOD EXCUSE TO GO OUT AND COLLECT ASSOCIATED MEMORABILIA
WHICH REALLY CREATED A SUPERHERO
WHICH BECOME QUITE VALUABLE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
JUST THINK OF THE HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY PAID BY THE COLLECTORS FOR TITANIC MEMORABILIA
BUT THANK GOD IT DIDN'T SELL
MY HEART BEGINS TO POUND
IF ONLY THAT HAD BEEN THERE
WHY DID IT MAKE SO MUCH MONEY
THE ESTIMATE WAS WRONG
I THINK I GOT IT WRONG
AND IN THE ART DECO STYLE
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
BUT SHE HAD THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND
SHE HAD THOUGHT ABOUT SELLING IT
SHE WANTED TO SELL THEM
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO RELATING AN ITEM TO A FAMOUS PERSON OR EVENT
SOMETIMES THE VALUE OF AN ANTIQUE ISN'T JUST THE INTRINSIC WORTH OF THE OBJECT
I THINK THEY'RE WORTH A LITTLE BIT
AND SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY SUPERB
IT'S THE STORY AND THE HISTORY BEHIND IT
WITH THE BENIN TRIBES
AS A DECORATIVE PIECE OF TRIBAL ART
BECAUSE OF THE PROVENANCE AND
IT'S PROBABLY WORTH TWENTY
SO SHE WAS DELIGHTED WHEN GEORGINA BROUGHT ALONG A MATCHING PAIR OF GLASS VASES TO OUR VALUATION
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY
FARM ANIMALS AND HORSES
WHEN IT'S A BIT WARMER
SO IF IT GETS COLD
SO HOW DO YOU GET PASTORAL FARMING WORKING WITH WILDLIFE
BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT DAVID HARTLEY WAS TALKING ABOUT CLIPPING COINS AND HE WAS
DAVID HARTLEY'S WIFE
UNPLEASANT ENOUGH IF IT HAPPENS TO DECIDE TO DINE ON YOUR BLOOD BUT POTENTIALLY DEADLY IF IT'S
THAT'S STILL TWO HUNDRED
WHERE DID BLUETON COME FROM
AFRICAN SWINE FEVER IS PRESENT AND THAT USUALLY KILLS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF DOMESTIC
AS WE'VE SEEN FROM PURBRIGHT
THEY'LL ONLY INVEST IN THE BEST
A COLLEAGUE OR A LOVED ONE
TWELVE HUNDRED UNITS TO CUSTOMERS
WHICH IS SOMETHING MY COMPETITORS
WHO ARE INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS PAINTING ON THEIR OWN
I WOULD PERSONALLY SAY YES
IN THE HEIGHT OF OUR SUMMER
I GOT AN ORDER FOR
YOU NEED TO STOP IT
ONCE YOU GET UNDER SOMEBODY'S RADAR
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEURS
THE KEY QUESTION THOUGH
IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT
A BUSINESS FAILURE IS A BLACK MARK AGAINST AN ENTREPRENEUR
WHEREAS IN AMERICA IT'S ALMOST A BADGE OF HONOUR
BUT MAYBE WE'RE BECOMING MORE FORGIVING IN THIS COUNTRY
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT REALLY MATTERS TO OUR NEXT VISITORS TO THE DEN MOTHER AND DAUGHTER ANGELA AND
VERY EARLY STAGE INVESTMENT WE GOT IN FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
YOU'D HAVE BALLET
I THINK IT'S A REALLY LOVELY QUALITY STORY
DOES WHAT IT SAYS ON THE TIN
IT'S WORTH ASKING
DID THE RIGHT GUYS GET THE MONEY
IF YOU HAD CASH TO SPARE
WOULD YOU PUT IT WHERE THE DRAGONS DID
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT ALL OF TONIGHT'S PITCHES CONTINUES ON TWITTER
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK
CAMPAIGN SUGGESTS STRATEGY AND POLICY
I DON'T NEED YOUR PERMISSION
I AM IN CHARGE OF ORGANISING VOLUNTEERS
LET'S GET THOSE BOXES BACK IN THE ATTIC
I DON'T A DRINK WINE
BEING OPEN ALL HOURS
TO BE OR NOT TO BE
I DON'T GET OUT ENOUGH
THAT IS THE POINT OF ADOPTION
SHE DOESN'T SEEM THE TYPE TO LIE
GET ONE OF THE BOYS TO HELP YOU OUT
ANOTHER GOWARD
I WASN'T GOING TO TAKE HER TO THE VIC
SHE STARTED WATCHING THIS AMERICAN DOCTOR SHOW
LIKE SOME CAPITAL
PROBLEM IS WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE
PAY PHONE IN BRAMPTON
NOT WHEN THE MAJOR INJURIES WERE SUSTAINED
BOTH FROM YOUR WIFE
NO MORE DEALING IN THE CLUB
I ENJOY GOING TO GIEKS
WHAT HE WOULD DO OR NOT DO
WITHOUT RISK OF PROSECUTION
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M EVER GOING TO WANT TO END MY LIFE
THE PAIN MIGHT NEVER BE INTOLERABLE
SO THIS CASE WENT ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS BECAUSE OF DEBBIE'S TENACITY AND THE FACT THAT SHE WAS
TO HAVE THIS DEBATE AND
AND REALLY GIVEN PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SOMETHING THAT MAYBE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE
DISABLED AND OLDER PEOPLE
HE'S BEEN UP ALL NIGHT
BECAUSE IT WASN'T HIS FAULT
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A BRUISE UNLESS YOU BOUGHT A LOAD OALE
BUT EVEN IN THIS DAY AND AGE
THE NICER I THINK HE LOOKS
ILL SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
SHE MIGHT COME OVER
AND MY MONEY AS WELL
IT'S TOO MUCH RESPONSIBILITY FOR ME
I THINK I CAN WALK
RUN THE PARISH COUNCIL
PERHAPS YOU'D TELL MRS FORBES HAMILTON THAT I'LL CALL IN LATER AND PAY MY LAST RESPECTS
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW WHICH SIDE OF THE ROAD THEY DRIVE YOU
I'M LEAVING TODAY
THAT'S WHERE I SHOULD BE
WHAT WAS HE BY TRADE
IVE JUST BEEN TALKING TO MRS PROCTOR
YOU MAY HAVE ASKED YOURSELF WHAT MY MOTIVES WERE
I WANTED TO BROADEN MY EXPERIENCE
THAT'S WHY I CAME
I'LL TALK TO YOU
A CHOPIN PRELUDE PERHAPS
YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE STRICT RULES REGARDING ENTERTAINING CAMPERS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX IN STAFF
SHOULD THERE BE ANY REPETITION OF LAST NIGHT'S INCIDENT
ONE OF THE CAMP RATS
MAKING ME DRESS UP AND
AND FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
BUT MPS HAVE ACCUSED THE BIG FIVE COMPARISON SITES OF NOT ALWAYS SHOWING THE CHEAPEST DEALS
THE FIRMS DEFENDED EARNING UP TO THIRTY POUNDS IN COMMISSION WHEN A CUSTOMER SWITCHES
THE TRIAL OF FORMER TV WEATHER PRESENTER FRED TALBOT HAD TO BE HALTED TODAY
INJURING HIS HEAD
WHILE LEAVING THE WITNESS BOX
HE DENIES HISTORICAL INDECENT ASSAULTS ON BOYS
FINALLY WE'RE TO GET A SEQUEL
HARPER LEE'S PUBLISHING A NOVEL SHE WROTE SIXTY YEARS AGO
IN A WORLD FIRST
THE AIMS TO PREVENT SERIOUS GENETIC DISEASES BEING PASSED ON
ISLAMIC STATE EXTREMISTS HAVE RELEASED A VIDEO SHOWING THE BRUTAL MURDER OF A CAPTURED JORDANIAN
DAVID CAMERON CALLED IT SICKENING
IF THEY WERE HERE
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ACCORDING TO HIS NOTES
NOBODY THINKS YOU'RE STUPID
IT WAS A PRIVATE CONVERSATION
I REALLY MISSED HIM WHEN I WAS IN AUSTRALIA
I'M JUST ASKING YOU TO MAKE A LITTLE MORE EFFORT
HE WAS DEAD AGAINST THE RIGHT TO BUY SCHEME BECAUSE HE BELIEVED IT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO A SHORTAGE OF
BUT I CAN'T GET INVOLVED
PEOPLE LIKE YOU GOING ON
IT'S NOT ABOUT SPACE OR RECREATION
I'D THINK TWICE ABOUT GOING INTO POLITICS
AND THEN SHE SAID
NO DOUBT DESCENDED FROM LAND THIEVES
THERE IS A SAYING IN OLD CZECHOSLOVAKIA
YOU SAID IT SOUNDED LIKE RAIN
IN SPITE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
I'LL COME STRAIGHT TO THE POINT
JUST WHERE I WANT
THE SERVICES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED IN THE PROPER WAY
ACCORDING TO THE KING JAMES BIBLE
WASN'T HE SUPER
THEN SOMEBODY SAYS
I'M ALL FOR REGIONAL ACCENTS
YOUR FRIEND AND MINE
I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
IT'S A SAD MOMENT
IT HAPPENS OVER LITTLE THINGS LIKE LIKE DRINKS
ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER
YOU'VE NOT KEPT YOUR PROMISE YET
WENT OVER TO EDO
GRANDMA'S AUTOGRAPH BOOK IS JUST ABOUT TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER
WHISPER IN MY EAR
TWO GLASS VASES JUST ABOUT TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER
THE SECOND BARONET
BECAUSE DAD TOOK HIM DOWN TO OXFORD
ON THE EVE OF HIS WEDDING DAY
I THINK YOU'LL HAVE WON IT
WHEN IT COMES TO MARKET VALUE
WE AGREED WITH YOUR VALUATION
SO WE ARE TO TAKE A STAND
FATHER IS THE CAPTAIN
THE CHAIRMAN AND THE TREASURER OF THE TEAM
FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS
BAYING FOR PRAISE
WHEN I HAD RETRIEVED LAWRENCE'S BOX
HE REPLIED THAT FOR A MATCH OF THIS IMPORTANCE
HE COULD NOT RISK HIS TROUSERS IN THE HANDS OF AN AMATEUR
I WOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO UMP IN BANBURY AGAIN
AND I SHALL REENTER THE HALL IF I SEE FIT
I AM A SUFFRAGETTE
I COULD FIND NO FAULT
IT'S ABOVE BOARD
I THINK I SHALL DIE FROM DULLNESS
YOU HAVE PROVED TO THE TOWNSFOLK AND THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN THAT WOMEN CAN AND SHALL DO WHAT MEN CAN
BUT HE HAS VOWED NEVER TO VISIT A PROFESSIONAL LAUND DRESS AGAIN
BUT THAT'S NOT HOW I PLAY THINGS
AND HIS HEART'S BROKEN
I'M BEING DIFFICULT
AND IF THE PROPOSED PARKING SOLUTIONS AREN'T UP TO MUSTER
I WANT TO FINISH MY BOOK FIRST
I WANT YOU TO RUN EVERY TAP IN THE HOUSE UNTIL THE WATER IN THAT TANK HAS BEEN CHANGED AT LEAST
I CAN PUT UP WITH HAVING TO TURN A CORNER EVERY TWO FEET AND TREADING IN BERTIE'S BOWL EVERY FIVE
I WANT TO GET ON WITH HIM BUT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
I AM GOING ACROSS TO THE MANOR
AH SO LUNCH WILL BE A LITTLE LATE
I'VE JUST THOUGHT THAT I GOT A GUEST COMING FOR LUNCH
I HAVE GOT AN IDEA
BUT I WANTED TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO SHOW MY ESTEEM
I THINK YOU'RE JOLLY LUCKY TO GET IT
THINGS WAS NEVER QUITE THE SAME
SO I GAVE UP THE JUGGLING AND I BECAME A COMIC
WELL THE PARENTS CERTAINLY HAVEN'T EXAGGERATED THE INCIDENT
WELL OF COURSE I WILL
MY SADDLES WET THROUGH
I HAVEN'T GOT A SPARE
HIS LIFE HE WAS A BIG STAR BEFORE THE FIRST WORLD WAR
I LIKE MY COUNTRY POTTERY
ONE ASPECT OF IT STILL IS VERY POPULAR AND EXTREMELY COLLECTABLE
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE TABLE SNUFF
AND ALTHOUGH QUEEN ANNE WAS A SNUFF TAKER
HE DESPISED IT WITH A PASSION
WHEREVER HE WENT
HE WOULD HAVE MESSAGES SENT FORWARD
DO NOT TAKE SNUFF
AND TO BE HONEST
SHE TOLD ME YOU TWO WEREN'T MARRIED
ADMITTING THAT BULLYING WAS DRIVING USERS AWAY
TWITTER SUCKS WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH ABUSE AND TROLLS
SO SAYS THE FIRM'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE
HE PROMISED TOUGHER ACTION TO DEAL WITH ABUSERS
BUT ALIENATING PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT YOU
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT
AH BOTH FROM THE MILL HEALTH CENTRE IN LEATHERBRIDGE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
LAST ONE I WENT TO
WHAT IF I'M RIGHT
NORMAL IS ONE THING BUT
BECAUSE WE'RE OUT OF TIME
SO THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
NORMAL IS ONE THING
LARRY WAS A PRAT
I KNOW YOUR SHORT
YOUR MOTHER NEVER SAID NO
MY WASHING MACHINE'S ON THE BLINK
IN RETURN FOR WHICH
DI THE MAN HAS CHANGED HANDS
THIS IS THE LAST STRAW
I JUST DID ALL THE WORK
I COULD STILL TAKE YOU TO THE BALL
I'M KEEPING OUT OF IT I'M GOING TO HAVE A NICE QUIET AFTERNOON ON THE BEACH
I WANT YOU TO JUMP A TEN FOOT FENCE
SOMEBODY HAS GOT SIGN FOR IT
ANYWAY THAT A DIDN'T DESERVE TO WIN
I'M VERY CONFUSED
FANCY BOTHER ME WITH A QUESTION LIKE THAT
IT WAS ALL RIGHT LAST YEAR
IT SINCE YOU ARRIVED
IF WE NEED MONEY DESPERATELIKE
EVEN ASSUMING WE GET THE MONEY
TWO HUNDRED POUNDS AND YOU LEAVE THE CAMP FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING
THE PATTERNS WENT A LITTLE BIT
IT'S COMPLETE AND
REMEMBER THAT LOVELY DUTCH KNEEHO DESK
THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT YOU FISH AND CHIPS
MAYBE IF YOU WERE CRAZY
NOW THIS IS ABOUT THE MOST INEXPENSIVE BRAND YOU CAN GET
THAT IS THE POINT OF ADOPTION
SHE DOESN'T SEEM THE TYPE TO LIE
GET ONE OF THE BOYS TO HELP YOU OUT
FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE
NOBODY WANTS TO DO ANYTHING
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
MIX LITTLE SHOW OF HANDS
I WAS DRAGGED OFF BY THE POLICE
SHE TOLD ME YOU TWO WEREN'T MARRIED
GIVE TILL IT HURTS
I'M IN A HIGHLY NERVOUS STATE
AND WE HAVE A CERTAIN ARRANGEMENT
AND ALL THE TIME DEEP INSIDE
WHICH INDEED YOU ARE
IT'S A TRIBUTE TO THE BRAVE CITY OF COVENTRY
THE GIRL WON'T BE BARE
JUST YOU WAIT AND SEE
I THINK WE'RE PERFORMING WELL
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I CAN BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE
NO ONE TO TALK TO
WHAT YOU NEED IS A SYMPATHETIC MARRIED WOMAN
I BELIEVE IN YOU KNOW MUSIC
I SHOULD GET HIM OUT MORE
YOU COULD START SLOW YOU KNOW
TOMORROW IS MY DAY OFF
AND IF WE COULD GET HIM OUT OF HERE SOMETIME THIS AFTERNOON
BUT WHAT IS EVERYTHING
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
WITH THE DISTINCT IMPLICATION THAT THE MINUTE I PUT THE PHONE DOWN
THERE'S NO GUARANTEEING THAT SHE'LL COME ROUND
THERE'S A FEW OLD COINS AS WELL
EVEN IF YOU'RE MARRIED
IT'S NOT A VERY NICE CLASS OF HOTEL
SHE MAY BE OVERFLOWING WITH THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS
I MAY NOW NEVER FINISH THAT BATTLESHIP
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE
INVITE WHOM YOU LIKE
QUITE THE FASHION
I'VE GOT MY TASTE
GET THE TECHNICAL SIDE RIGHT
INTRODUCING MORE CREATIVITY
NOT JUST TALK THE TALK
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PEOPLE
SHOULD BE REALLY FUN TO WATCH
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONES LIVING HERE AT THE END OF THE DAY
IT'S JUST THAT WHOEVER PUT IT IN
MORE IS IN MY MIND
IT'S ANOTHER ADVENTURE
IF WE CAN'T WORK TOGETHER
PUSH THE BOUNDARIES
IS THAT NOW THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY FACED
I'M JUST NOT A SEEY PERSON AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT
IT'S JUST SO OBVIOUS
AND SO MAYBE YOU CAN JUST TELL ME WHAT YOUR INITIAL THOUGHTS ARE ON THIS ROOM
BRING OUT THE BEST IN EACH OTHER
THEY ARE QUITE DIFFICULT TO PLEASE
THEY'VE GOT THEIR TASTES AND WE'VE GOT OURS
SO THIS IS TOUGH
TWO HUNDRED PILLOW CASES
LAST TIME I WERE AROUND THE CAMPS
EVERY THURSDAY WILL BE SUNSHINE SMILE DAY
BUT A FULL SMILE
WITH FLASHING MOLARS
THE WORLD IS A BETTER PLACE WITH A SMILE
WHAT A GREAT IDEA FOR A SONG
I'VE GOT THIS THIS MESSAGE FROM JOE MAPLIN TO READ OUT TO YOU
WAIT TILL THEN LET'S START NOW
WE SHARE AND SHARE ALIKE
YOUR RADIO MAPLIN ANNO SO
I PUT SMALL FUR CONES UNDER THE SADDLES
I REALLY MUST HAVE A SERIOUS TALK TO HIM
NO NOT WITH YOUR HUSBAND
I'M SURE TED'S UPSET ENOUGH ABOUT THAT
THE CATERERS MIGHT SAVE A BIT ON LUNCH
BEHIND US THAT'S HUNDREDS OF PROGRAMS AND THOUSANDS OF YOUR ANTIQUES VALUED AND SOLD
SO STAND BY FOR SOME TOP TIPS
WHAT I THOUGHT
THOUSANDS OF POUNDS
WE ALL LIKE TO BE BESIDE THE SEA
AND THERE WAS SOME QUITE INTERESTING HISTORIC DOCUMENTATION IN THE PHOTOGRAPHIC
OR A GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION
A LOT OF COLLECTIONS DO
BUT CONVERSELY TO THAT
COLLECTORS LOOKING FOR FRESH CARDS ONTO THE MARKET LOVE
FOR A MIXED COLLECTION WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY NATURALLY FORMED FROM A CORRESPONDENCE WHICH TOOK PLACE IN
AND THAT WAS THE IMPORTANT ELEMENT
AND IF YOU GET THAT SORT OF ART IN GOOD CONDITION
I THINK THEY'RE VERY FUNNY
THAT DON'T RECOGNISE WHAT THEY'VE GOT
HERE'S NICK HALL WITH SOME USEFUL POINTERS
REALLY DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF THE GENRE OF THE THING THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT BUYING
WHERE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURY FINE PORCELAIN
AND THEN IT BECOMES ABSOLUTELY KEY AND PARAMOUNT
AS IN ANY FIELD OF ANTIQUES
THE WOODEN BOATBUILDING INDUSTRY HAS PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN SUNDERLAND'S NAUTICAL HISTORY
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO SELL
BRING IT IN TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS
AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN HELP YOU OFF ON A TRIP OF A LIFETIME
PLEASE JOIN ME AGAIN SOON FOR MORE TRADE SECRET
BUT IT'S FARMING ITSELF THAT MIGHT JUST BRING THE BIRDS BACK
AS MY WORKPLACE
THEY'VE BEEN IN AND EATEN ALL THAT SEED
SO NOW THEY'RE GETTING REALLY HUNGRY
THE WHOLE THING
WE NEED TO KEEP FEEDING
WE'VE SHOWN THAT
EVERYTHING YOU LOOK AT OUT THERE IS INFLUENCED BY FARMING AND AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN
WITH EVERY TURN OF THE BLADE
THAT MEANS THAT FOR THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR
BUT THIS SITE IN PARTICULAR
IT'S QUITE SMALL
IT SEEMS SENSIBLE TO USE THE POWER THEY GENERATE
WE'LL NEED TO IMPROVE THE GRID
YOU HAVE TO TAKE SUBSIDIES AWAY AND LET THEM FIGHT THEIR WAY INTO THE SYSTEM LIKE ANY OTHER
THEN THEY WILL ACTUALLY HAVE A LONG TERM FUTURE
IT'S TOUGH LOVE
WHEN THEY KNOW ONLY TOO WELL THAT THERE ARE THREE
WHAT I WILL SAY IS
LABOUR IS COMMITTED TO OUR RENEWABLE TARGETS
BECAUSE WE FEEL IN THE LONG RUN IT WILL COST US LESS AND MAKE US MORE SECURE IN TERMS OF OUR ENERGY
AH RINGERS CAN ACCESS IT
BUT WHAT WE'RE AFTER IS A FARMLAND BIRD
AND YOU'VE BEEN HERE A VERY SHORT TIME
NOMINATIONS ARE ONLY OPEN FOR ONE MORE WEEK
AND WE HAVE A RANGE OF DIFFERENT NEEDS
WE HAVE VISUAL IMPAIRMENT
NOW GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND
IT'S STILL A HER
BUT ALSO THE DRIVER
AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT
NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF THEM ARE OUT OF WORK
I'M JUST THINKING
THANK YOU FOR WORKING HARD
THANK YOU FOR PAYING TAXES
NO ONE ELSE IS GOING TO DO IT
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT
DRIVING AROUND IN BRITAIN
THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE
AH THERE'S A WORLD IN WHICH THAT WILL WORK
I KNEW IT WAS MORE
SOME DIFFERENT EMOTIONS
BUT HE SAYS THAT
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE
THE GUY FOLLOWING HIM EVERY WEEKEND
WE HAVE MADE THREE AMBULANCES
AND TO BE HONEST
NOT ONE OF THEM HAS YET DELIVERED A PATIENT TO A HOSPITAL ALIVE
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING
SEE YOU AGAIN NEXT WEEK
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR CASH TO BUILD THEIR BUSINESSES
BUT ONLY IN THE BEST
ALLOWING YOU TO MAKE MANY AN OUTFIT POP
INNOVATIVE NEW IDEA
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT ANYWHERE ELSE
AND IF I DO SEE IT AS A MASSIVE MARKET
WHAT WE'VE GOT IS SOMETHING RIGHT FOR PEOPLE SELLING FOOD AND DRINK ONLINE AND GETTING IT TO THE END
FIVE MILLION SALES
DAN TAKES A VERY MINIMAL SALARY
RIGHT NEXT TO THE SINK
YOU'RE GOING TO GO VERY NICHE
I COULD HAVE A SEXY TOOTHBRUSH IN THE BATHROOM
I APPRECIATE THAT
THEY WOULD INVEST TWO
THERE'S NOTHING ORIGINAL ABOUT SELLING CLOTHES ON THE WEB
THAT HAS BEEN DONE FOR YEARS
INDIVIDUAL SERVICE TAILORED TO EACH CUSTOMER
THE SORT OF THING YOU MIGHT GET IN A TOP STORE
SO AS THEY THINK THEY'VE DESIGNED A WAY OF DELIVERING IT ONLINE
AND WE HAVE SECURED JUST UNDER ONE THOUSAND
WE HAVE CREDIT TERMS
IF YOU HAVE A VIEW ON ANY OF TONIGHT'S PITCHES
YOU CAN JOIN THE CONVERSATION ON TWITTER
USING THE HASHTAG
OR ANY OF THEM FOR THAT MATTER
NOT HAVING A LARGE FIELD
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
I'M PLANTING THEM
GOOD GREEN LEAVES AND
SO THEY START TO DIE BACK
LIKE MY FRIENDS
ONE OF THESE DAYS
I AM BULLETPROOF
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
IMAGINE IF SHOPKEEPERS ALL DID THAT
IF I COULD HARNESS ALL THAT ENERGY
I GO EAT THIS PLACE FOR A WEEK
SHE LOOKS SUCH A QUIET LITTLE WOMAN IN THAT
IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW
THEN I WOULD NOT HESITATE
WE HAD A MARVELLOUS TIME
WE MUST TREAT HER JUST AS WE WOULD ANY OTHER SOCIAL CASUALTY LIKE ME
I'M PROVIDING THE HORSE
WELL WE'LL SAY THERE'S BEEN A FRIGHTFUL MISTAKE
BARE LEGS AND PLASTIC MACS
YES IT'S QUITE A GOOD IDEA
IT WOULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
WITH THOSE ROSES
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
AND HIS MOTHER IS VERY PROUD OF HIS VOICE SHE IS PROMISED
THAT IF HE WINS THE CHILDREN'S SINGING COMPETITION
AND I THINK WE CAN UNDOUBTEDLY GIVE YOU THE PRIZE FOR THE OLDEST THING ON FLOG IT TODAY
PROBABLY IN BIRMINGHAM
EVEN IF HE'S GOT SIX CARRIAGE CLOCKS IN HIS CELL
WELL DO YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT TALKING ABOUT WORKS OF ART
THIS IS REALLY DEAR TO ME
CAN WE GO BACK AND FINISH IT OFF
IT'S BEEN SO INSPIRATIONAL
KEEPING A TRADITION AND A SPIRIT WELL ALIVE HERE IN WALES
AND IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO PAY HIM A VISIT
AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MAKE MY OWN WITH HIS EXPERT GUIDANCE
IN YOUR HANDS ENTIRELY
A SHOPPING TRIP IN NEW YORK AND POSSIBLY
AFTER THE WEDDING
I HEARD THE BACK DOOR OPEN
WE'RE BOTH ON HOLIDAY LEAVE
WE WERE PLANNING TO GO TRAVELLING FOR A FEW MONTHS
BUT THIS LADY WILL NOT LET YOU DIE
WE ALL KNOW WHERE HE IS
HE NEVER RAISED A HAND TO ME
SHE JUST GOT IN WITH A BAD LOT
SHE'S OUR ONLY CHILD
I GRABBED THE KNIFE
AND WHEN SHE FOUND IT
BUT I THINK IF THE AVERAGE MAN HAD BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR SHAPING HIS OWN END THEN
BUT THE WAY I PHRASED THE QUESTION
SHE'S BECOMING A BIT OF A NUISANCE
BEEN BROWSING THROUGH SOCIETY MAGAZINES
I DON'T FANCY IT
SO I THOUGHT I'D DO A WEAK STAGE CRAFT COURSE
SHE'S VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT EL CHINA
WHERE TO FIND IT
FOLLOW THAT LINE OF REASONING
I'VE BEEN A BIT
YOU'VE DROPPED SOME VERY BROAD HINTS
NEPTUNES AND OCTOPUSES IS OLD HAT
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
BUT I REALLY DO ENJOY READING THESE LETTERS
YOU'VE GOT TO PULL YOUR SOCKS UP ABOUT YOUR POOL FUN
LAST WEEK I DROPPED IN ON THE WALMSLEY CAMP OF A SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND THEIR POOL FUN
WHAT WE NEED IS SOMETHING LIKE OLLY THE OCTOPUS
WHERE I COME FROM
IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY THERE WERE THE SIRENS
IT WAS IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO SEE HER
NOT FOR ANOTHER SIX WEEKS
HAVE A NICE JOURNEY
I THINK IT'S CLASS DISTINCTION
I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR GETTING ME THAT INTERVIEW
BUT ANY MOMENT THE DOORS ARE GONNA BE OPEN AND OUR CROWD WILL BE FLOODING THROUGH AND I CAN HEAR THEM COMING
NOT FOR MUCH LONGER
IF YOU'RE HAPPY
I'M SURE THEY'LL BE VERY WELL FANCIED
I'D LIKE TO SEE
AND I RECKON WITH IT WITH THE PROPER TREATMENT
YOU WOULD TRY ANYTHING
THERE'S THIS YOUNG MAN
I'M GLAD I GOT THERE BEFORE YOU DID
SHE CAN COME BACK FROM THIS
AMERICA'S CONFIRMED HOSTAGE KAYLA MO HAS BEEN KILLED
BUT PRESIDENT ASSAD HAS SPOKEN TO US
FIVE MILLION POUNDS FOR THE MIX UP
SHE WAS WALKING WITH HER GRANNY
WHO'S IN A CRITICAL CONDITION
I CAN HANDLE FLESH
AH SO LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
AS THEY AS THE OLDER ONES DEVELOPED AND GOT MORE EXPERIENCED
AND WE HAD A DAY OFF IN ROME
WHICH IS VERY FORTUNATE
TEACHING THEM MUSIC ON PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS
ON BRASS INSTRUMENTS
AND THEN THAT GREW
I REMEMBER SOMETHING
I'M TRYING TO WORK OUT WHICH IS THE ASS
JOHN CABOT'S VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY TO AMERICA
BRISTOL CREAM SHERRY
THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE
GLORIOUS BLUE COLOUR
IT'S A BIT OF A MYSTERY
BUT JUST LISTEN TO THIS
FOR OUR TEAMS OVER AT THE AUCTION
EIGHTY FIVE PLANS WENT TO MARK
SO LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT THAT
AND YOU GAVE ANITA A MEASLY FORTY
YOU ARE PLUS FIFTEEN
I CAME HERE WITH THE RAMBLERS ASSOCIATION IN BATH ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO AND
AND WE NEED TO FIND OUT IS THERE A PROBLEM
THEY MIGRATE FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT MOST OTHER BIRD SPECIES DO HARD WEATHER AND SHORTAGE OF
SO EVEN IF THERE'S PLENTY OF FOOD
YOU' GOING TO HAVE TO BE MULTILINGUAL
THERE'S ONE THING THEY'D PRETTY MUCH BE GUARANTEED TO SAY
HE'S NIPPED OVER TO FRANCE AND SPAIN
THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
WE CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT WE'RE REAL
I THOUGHT HE WAS DISTRACTED BY THE CHILDREN BUT
BUT THEN THEY LEFT
IT'S ORCHIDS AND SUNFLOWERS THAT WILL WIN THE DAY
WE DON'T WANT THAT
RAAR SOMEHOW WE MUST RAISE MONEY
WHICH TIME YOU GOT MARRIED AGAIN
FIRST THERE'S A PICTURE OF THE MANOR
I NEED A BUTLER
AND SERVE ME RIGHT
HOW COULD YOU DO A THING LIKE THAT
THEY DON'T WANT THEIR OLD ENGLISH TONIC TURNED INTO A BRATISLAVAN JOKE
I DON'T WANT TO START NOTE CRITICISM
BUT I WAS AT BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND THE ATMOSPHERE WAS
THIS ONE IS AN AEROPLANE
ALL THE WAY FROM FROM WAKEY
YOU ALWAYS PLACE IT
FOR EXAMPLE I WANT TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO THEM
WHEN WE SIT THERE SOAKING UP THE MUSIC
MR JEFFREY FAIR
DON'T TELL ME TO SHUSH
I WOULDN'T DO THAT
THAT WAS THE RECORD
BUT THIS IS EXCEPTIONAL
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT DO A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT
I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO THE HOUSE
IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE FILMING HERE IN DISS AND WE ALL CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK
THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE
IT IS MY EMPIRICAL
BUT I FIND THAT
BY ACCEPTING THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS
LAWRENCE WAS FORCED TO ATTEND THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF BALL BEARING MANUFACTURERS IN A SPORTS
I AM ASHAMED TO ADMIT THAT I CANNOT
THE THRILL OF A MUTTON SHOP
AND WHEN WOMEN ARE TROUSER WEARING VOTERS
WE SHALL BE EVALUATED ON OUR WIT
AND WE WILL WIN
THEY ALREADY HAD A SCIENTIFIC NAME
THEY HAD NO ENGLISH NAME
WHERE WE SEE THEM IN OUR GARDENS
REMEMBER THAT AT THAT TIME
WHO WAS PLANTING THEM
THE TREES TRYING TO AVOID THE DINOSAURS
THE DINOSAURS EVOLVING NEXT TO GO UP
THE DINOSAURS BECAME EXTINCT
THEY'VE GOT THESE VERY TALL TRUNKS
THEY'RE PROBABLY LOVING IT TODAY
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS
AND YOU'RE ON THE REGISTER
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE BUT
AND IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN
BUT I WANT YOU TO TALK TO HIM
HE BE BROKE INTO MY HOUSE
I STAND OVER AT THE BEDSIDE SOMETIMES
YOU HAVE HAD SEVEN CHILDREN
THE GREAT REAPER
IT MAKES YOU WISH YOU WERE TWENTY YEARS LONGER
ONLY TEN HOURS A DAY FOR SEVEN DAYS
AND WHAT IS MORE
WORKING ON MY ESTATE THIS WEEK
CHAP WORKING ON MY ESTATE THIS WEEK
THAT THESE AREN'T ISOLATED CASES
THE CRAFTY DEVIL
I WAS ALL WET THEN
HOW WOULD IT BE IF YOU HAD TWO SETS OF CLOTHES
MEAN WHAT'S FOUR HOURS TO A KID
I'LL HAVE TO PUT IT TO HEAD OFFICE
WHEN THAT HAPPENS
REGULAR AS CLOCKWORK
QUI A BENT JOCK YOU CAN'T MAKE THE WEIGHT
THEN CAME THE SPEECHES
I THOUGHT THE MIC BROKE
THE TOILET ROLL
LAST BUT NOT LEAST
I'M GOING TO BUY YOU A BIG HOUSE
IT WAS ONE MASSIVE MISTAKE
WHY ARE WE EVEN DOING IT
ARE WE AMERICAN
WE WILL BE PLEASANT
IF YOU MAKE A PROPER EFFORT
SHE RUNS RINGS AROUND HIM
IT WAS NEVER GOING TO WORK
OTHERWISE YOU'LL BE ON THE RUN ALL YOUR LIFE
SHE HAD A TANTRUM
PRICES WILL PROBABLY STOP RISING AND ACTUALLY FALL IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS
THAT'S WHAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND BOSS SAID TODAY
IF NEGATIVE INFLATION CONTINUES INTEREST RATES COULD BE CUT
REVENGE PORN IS NOW ILLEGAL IN ENGLAND AND WALES
THE NEW OFFENCE CAME IN TODAY
ANYONE WHO SHARES AN EXPLICIT IMAGE OR VIDEO OF SOMEONE WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION COULD GET TWO
WE'RE NOT MAKING MONEY
THEY ORDER ONLINE
TWELVE FOR THE PREVIOUS COMPANY'S FINANCIAL YEAR
OBVIOUSLY IT MAKES IT MUCH EASIER FOR ME TO BUY THINGS AND HAVE THE PARCELS DELIVERED TO MY HOUSE
AND I MUST ADMIT WE HAD A FEW GLASSES THAT DAY
IN THE PAST HOUR WE'VE BEEN HEARING THE PARCEL DELIVERY COMPANY CITY LINK
WHICH EMPLOYS MORE THAN TWO
AND NOW THEY CAN REACT TO THAT QUICKLY
LET'S NOT GET CARRIED AWAY
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CALL YOUR PARENTS
I WAS TOO LITTLE
SO I WAS PUT IN CARE FOR A LITTLE WHILE
LASTED TWO YEARS
SUPPOSED TO BE ADOPTING ME
THEY'RE NOT MY FAMILY
MY BEDROOM WAS ON THE GROUND FLOOR
ERRAND BOY JOKES
AH SHUT IT ON THE WAY OUT
THEY'RE NOT BY BRUISES
THEY YOGURT STINGS
WAY BEFORE YOUR TIME
AND VERY TASTY SHE LOOKED TOO
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT YOU IN THE LIGHT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOCK TO COME INTO THE DRAWINGROOM
WOULD YOU STEP THIS WAY
I'VE COME TO CONGRATULATE YOU
TO PUT IT IN A PLAIN
STRAIGHT FORWARD MANNER
YOU MIGHT NOT REALIS THAT I'M A SERGEANT IN THE METROPOLITAN POLICE
IF I SHARED IT OUT AMONGST ALL THOSE YELLOW COATS
YOU TAKE THE TINY TOT'S CAKE EATING COMPETITION
I'M SORRY I'M LATE EVERYBODY
NOT LONG AFTER GOODNIGHT CAMPUS
GOOD LUCK TO HER
IF THE WORST COMES TO THE WORST
MY NAME IS PRITCHARD
WHO I NOW KNOW AS JEFFREY FAIRBROTHER
AND WHO WAS IN THE STATE OF INTOXICATION
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S THE SEMIFINALS AND THE WINNER GOES THROUGH TO THE GRAND FINAL WITH A VERY
CONGRATULATIONS TO HER
THANKS FOR WATCHING
I DIDN'T SAY THAT
I HADN'T BEEN BROUGHT UP THAT WAY
TONIGHT'S NOT ABOUT ME
BUT IF I'VE GOT FRIENDS OVER
HEARING THAT ICE CREAM VAN A COUPLE OF STREETS AWAY
I REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS NOT A FAD
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE SALAD CREAM
VERY SIMILAR TO A TEMPURA BATTER
SOME OF THEM COST AS MUCH AS FIVE HUNDRED
SHE RUINED YOUR LIFE
AFTER THE WEDDING
I'M GOING TO PRINT ALL THIS STUFF UP AND I WILL BE READY
AND I RECKON WITH IT WITH THE PROPER TREATMENT YOU
WITH THE RIGHT TREATMENT
YOU WOULD TRY ANYTHING
I'M GLAD I GOT THERE BEFORE YOU DID
SHE CAN COME BACK FROM THIS
I'M GOING TO BUY YOU A BIG HOUSE
IT WAS ONE MASSIVE MISTAKE
WHY ARE WE EVEN DOING IT
ARE WE AMERICAN
WE WILL BE PLEASANT
IF YOU MAKE A PROPER EFFORT
SHE RUNS RINGS AROUND HIM
IT WAS NEVER GOING TO WORK
OTHERWISE YOU'LL BE ON THE RUN ALL YOUR LIFE
I DIDN'T SAY THAT
I HADN'T BEEN BROUGHT UP THAT WAY
I DON'T MEAN SHE'S A WOMAN
I THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY OUGHT TO USE IT TOWARDS THE WAR EFFORT THEN
GENERAL FRENCH IT WAS AN ENGLISH GENERAL
CERTAINLY THE PRESENCE OF THE WARDENS WILL MAKE IT A BIT OF A SHAMBLES
I WENT TO A WEDDING ONCE
CAN'T SAY THE SAME ABOUT THE REST OF THEM
LIFE IN KIT LO
BED LIKE A FAST SCAN
I BELIEVE WITH THE RIGHT TEAM
SIZE OF YOUR STREAK
YOU MAY THINK I'M AN OLD M MISER
IT IS MY HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY
IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH
MAKE SURE THAT HE IS GOING TO PASS THE SHOP
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ME ANYTHING
WHAT LITTLE BARGAINS CAN WE PUT HIM ON TO
AS THE PERSON YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ENGAGED TO
THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN
WHEN WE HAVE TO
CRUISING AT A STEADY MACH SIX
OR AS WE SAY LOCALLY
WE'LL GO STRICTLY FOR QUAIN
I AM NOTORIOUS ON THE TONGS
BUT USUALLY I JUST SAVE THEM FOR THE SUMMER MONTHS
AS A MATTER OF ACTUAL FACT
THAT'S ALL THEY EVER DO DO
WE'VE GOT AN EMPTY SHOP
YEAH YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN
NEED A SHOULDER TO LEAN ON
IF I HAVE MADE A PROFIT BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR
WELL EVERY BIRD AND EVERY SQUIRREL THAT'S EVER VISITED THAT TREE
CHAP HE'S ON OUR SIDE
ACCORDING TO HIM
BY APPOINTMENT TO HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN
SHE'S DOUBLE CROSSED US
THAT'S THE LETTER
DISGUISED AS A CAMPER
WE HAVE A BIT OF A PROBLEM
YOU CAN HAVE TWENTY QUID A WEEK EXPENSES
BUT TO QUOTE JOE MAPLIN YET AGAIN
WE'VE GOT TWENTY QUID A WEEK EXPENSES
ALL I'M SAYING IS GOLD
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT BOX ALL ROUND THE WALL WITH LOVELY LEATHER BACKS
IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO THIS
I HAD TO MAKE THE SAME CHOICE
I COME IN HERE COLLECT IT EVERY NIGHT ON MY WAY TO THE BALLROOM AND THEN IF I CAN'T SLEEP
I SUDDENLY THOUGHT TO MYSELF
ANYTHING LIKE THAT
I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY MADE IN CANTON
THE MOTIFS WERE CHINESE
THERE WAS A DRAGON
LOOK FOR A GRAIN IN THE MATERIAL
IVORY HAS A VERY DISTINCT GRAIN
THERE CAN BE A DIAMOND RING
THEY'D BEEN THERE
THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE PIECES OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CARICATURE IN THERE
WHERE THERE'S A GOOD MARGIN AROUND THE THE THE PRINT IMAGE
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS THINK
WHO KNOWS MORE ABOUT THIS THAN ME
AND GO AND ASK A SECOND OPINION
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW IT
BUT HALF THE TIME
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHERE I WENT
ONE OF THE GREAT CAR BOOT FINDS OF THE PROGRAMME THAT I'VE HAD THAT I'VE HAD INVOLVEMENT WITH
AND IT WAS SO OBVIOUS IT WASN'T A FAKE
THE AGE WAS WAS WRITTEN ALL OVER IT AND THE MARKS
TO TELL TELL
I REMEMBER THE LIP AND TOOTH MARKS ON IT
AND JUST EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
THERE'S A COUPLE OF REASONS FOR THAT
MALCOLM HAD ONLY PAID THIRTY PENCE FOR IT
THEY WILL HAVE DEVELOPED AN EYE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME
THEY WERE QUITE AN UNUSUAL PATTERN
THEY WERE SMALL
THEY WERE PRETTY ENOUGH
SAME SORT OF TOOLS
I SAID WE'D HAVE AN HOUR ON THIS
HE'S A MAN WITH A PASSION FOR ANTIQUES AND COLLECTABLES
I SAW IT ON THE M ONE AND I FOLLOWED IT ALL THE WAY FROM LEEDS DOWN TO RUGBY AND
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
I HOPE WE'VE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOVER THOSE OVERLOOKED TREASURES
SO GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND GET OUT THERE CAR BOOTING
IT MAY BE THE BEST THING YOU'VE EVER DONE
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT BROWN BEARS OR POLAR BEARS
THE PANDA IS A CARNIVORE THAT HAS GONE VEGETARIAN AND IT HAS CHOSEN ONE OF THE
BUT FOR A PANDA
TO GET ENOUGH CALORIES TO SURVIVE JUST EATING THIS
THEY HAVE TO EAT FOR
WE WANT TO CARE FOR IT
SEA OTTERS DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF BLUBBER
BUT WHAT THEY DO HAVE IS
THEY'VE GOT BLUBBER
SO SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON HERE
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE THROUGH TODAY
WHEN WE GO TO SLEEP
IT'S WHAT MAKES THESE ANIMALS SUCCESSFUL
BUT THE WAY THAT WE ARE DRAWN TO THEM
AND THAT DIDN'T GO DOWN WELL WITH SOME
AND ALMOST EVERY HUNT IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS OUT TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE BAN AGAINST
TO THE EXACT WORDING IN THE LAW
THE POLICE ARE CONCERNED
IF THEY GET A CHANCE
WILL HUNT PRETTY MUCH AS THEY ALWAYS DID AND CHASE A FOX
IT IS A GOOD SIZE
AND TWO HOUNDS CAN PUSH A FOX ROUND AND ROUND IN THERE FOR SOME TIME BEFORE IT ACTUALLY PRESENTS
DEBATE IS A NONSENSE
MOST PEOPLE DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT
MOST REASONABLE PEOPLE
OVER THIS PERIOD
THOSE WHO ARE AGAINST HUNTING SAY THAT THE LAW IS LARGELY WORKING AND THE FOX IS BETTER OFF
THE HUNTING COMMUNITY SAY LOOK
IT'S REALLY PLEASURABLE
AND WHEN THE DIFFICULT TIME CAME
WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING FOREST RIDGEBACKS
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE WEATHER'S GOT IN STORE FOR THE WEEK
AND HE WANTED TO GET HIS OWN BACK
WHEN THE BECLEYS WERE AWAY
SHE KILLED TWENTY SEVEN OF THEIR PRIZE STAGS WITH HER BOW ARROW
YOU CAN IMAGINE
WHEN LORD BERKELEY RETURNED
WE'RE GOING TO BE IN SUFFOLK
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS
AND WE START WITH BIG NEWS
THIS IS THE BIGGEST NEWS WE'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME
I HATED YOUR THING ON AMBULANCES
AS WE HAVE ESTABLISHED
YOU DON'T PUSH BUTTONS TO DO THAT
YEAH VERY POPULAR SHOW
LET'S PUT A STAR IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR
MY GUEST TONIGHT WAS JORDAN BELFORT'S WIFE IN THE WOLF OF WALL STREET
LET'S BE HONEST
STRIPPED IT DOWN
LOVING PROCESS OF RESTORING IT TO ITS FORMER GLORY
BECAUSE WE NEED THE ENGINE TO POWER THE WINCH
POUNDS OF MY OWN MONEY
I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE YOUR TIME ANYMORE
WHOLE FOODS MARKET
OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEUR
BELIEVES HIS ADULTS AND KIDS' CYCLE HORNS DO EXACTLY THAT
IT'S JUST ME WORKING ON THIS
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THAT STOPS
YOU PUT UP A WEBSITE WHERE CUSTOMERS CAN FIND THINGS THEY WANT TO BUY
ONLINE RETAILING VERSION TWO
YOU PUT UP A WEBSITE THAT FINDS OUT ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS AND TELLS THEM WHAT THEY WANT TO BUY
ON AVERAGE THEYWAPE ABOUT FIFTY ITEMS
BACKGROUNDS IN CONSUMER INTERNET AND BACKGROUNDS AND TECHNOLOGY
YOU KNOW YOU MAKE CHOICES
YOU CAN JOIN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT AND ALL OF TONIGHT'S PITCHES ON TWITTER
BECAUSE I WAS STANDING
SHE'S BEEN REALLY FUNNY WITH ME LATELY
BUT IT'S A REAL RISK
BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE
EVEN THE SCIENCE OF IT
YOU CAN WAIT FOR HER
THAT IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING
IF YOU WANT TO BE SENTIMENTAL
THAT'S UP TO YOU
IT'S VERY FLATTERING
ALTHOUGH I'D HATE TO STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR PHOTOGRAPHIC CAREER
YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO LEARN
IS A GREAT DAY FOR PERSONAL DISCOVERIES
ME MOTHER WAS THE FISHERMAN'S FRIEND AND I GOT A BOTTOM A CALLED HUGO
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT
LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT
THEY'RE ONLY THAT PRICE TEMPORARILY FOR PEOPLE WHO COME IN HERE WITH A IREGULAR WEEKLY ORDER
I KNOW YOU OF OLD
ONE DAY ALL THIS WILL BE MINE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE HEALING PROFESSION
IT'S BEEN FEATURED IN YOUR WINDOW ON YOUR WINDOW
WHAT DOES HE WANT
AND WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO WITH A LOAD OF OLDER DAMAGED BUNS THAT HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THIS FILTHY
IT'S THE JAPANESE
IF I CAN ONCE PERSUADE HIM OF THE MAGICAL PROPERTIES OF GINGER CAKE HE WILL SPREAD THE GOSPEL ALL ROUND
RA YOUR BLADES AND ONE GINGER CAKE
WHAT YOU MEAN
SHE'S NOT BAD LOOKING
IT WASN'T COMPULSORY TO STOP
IT'S NOT AS IF YOU'VE GOT MUCH OF A PART
YOU LEARN TO BE AT ONE WITH NATURE
THE FROST MAKES THE EARTH FRIABLE
IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR KINGS AND QUEENS
FROM THE LOOK OF YOU
NEVER RESTRICT YOUR MOVEMENTS
LEAVING OUT TED
IT'S JUST ON IT VULGARITY IT'S THE BRITISH SENSE OF YOU
WHAT ABOUT YOUR UNIVERSITY LOT
WHEN REQUIRED BY THE MANAGEMENT
I MUST SAY I DO SYMPATHISE
BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING I'D RATHER NOT MENTION THE NAME OF THE COMPETITION
THEY DIDN'T FINISH GOODNIGHT CAMPUS UNTIL TWELVE O'CLOCK
LATER ON THE SHOW
WE'RE OFF TO AUCTION WHERE THE TEMPERATURE WILL RISE EVEN HIGHER
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT
BUT AT THE MOMENT
UNLESS THEY'RE VERY SCARCE
WE'VE SEEN THEM ON THE SHOW BEFORE
IT'S GOING UNDER THE HAMMER NOW
THE HOPS WERE ADDED TO PRESERVE THE BEER BUT THEY ALSO ADDED A BITTERNESS
AND YOU HAD PEOPLE TALKING
BUT I THINK WITH THE CONTENTS
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE PART IN THE SHOW
ALL THE INFORMATION IS THERE
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER
CHECK THE DETAILS IN YOUR PRESS BECAUSE
IT'S BY MARTIN BROTHERS
IS IT A FAMILY THING
THAT THAT THEY ARE THE POTTERY ITEMS WHICH ARE COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
JOIN US AGAIN FOR MANY MORE
LET'S GET ERIC DOWN AND GIVE HIM THAT LITTLE CHAT
ABOUT THE FACTS OF LIFE
I WILL NEVER DO IT
THAT MIGHT WORK
I KNOW AND I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY
I'M GOING THROUGH THERE
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YA
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM YA
RIGHT DEEP INTO HIS THROAT SO HE CAN'T SPEAK
MUST NOT DO ANY MUSIC CONCERTS
I'M SURE I HEARD SOMETHING REALLY BORING
I'M RATHER BUSY AT THE MOMENT
I WROTE IT IN MY ROOM MYSELF
I LIVE WITH MY FATHER
THE BETTER EQUIPPED WE ARE OF TAKING DOWN THE SUPER CLINIC
I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND FOR DESIGN
SHE WON'T DO IT AGAIN
I'LL TALK TO HER
JUST A BIT TIRED
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO COPE WITH A FEW BILLS
SEEMS LIKE A GREAT PLACE
INVOICES WOULD GO THROUGH
I'VE BEEN LYING AWAKE AT NIGHT WORRYING
YOU JUST WANT TO STEAL SIERRA AND GET YOURSELF A READY MADE FAMILY
EVERY MEAL TIME
WE HAVE THE RATES TO PAY
FROM TODAY'S LIBERATED YOUNG PEOPLE
IS A WELL TRAINED
KEEP GETTING YOURSELF SIGNED IN BY A MEMBER
OF COURSE YOU DO
I MIGHT EVEN AT TAKE IN ATKINSON TERRACE
WHAT NUMBER ATKINSON TERRACE WOULD THAT BE
HOWEVER DID YOU BECOME COUNTY COMMISSIONER
USUAL ANONYMOUS DONOR
YOU NEED A STRETCHER
CAVALRY TROOPERS ONE U
JOHN WAYNE TYPE
THE HORSE COMES WITH IT
THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF A SMALL SEASIDE TOWN
WELCOME TO A VERY STYLISH EPISODE OF FLOG IT
THEY'RE ALL HERE AND THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL
FOR OVER TWELVE YEARS NOW AND ONE THING I CAN GUARANTEE IS YOU NEVER GET TIRED OF THE BUZZ AND THE
AND I WOULD EXPECT HIM TO PUSH ON HOPEFULLY TOWARDS THE THOUSAND
HE WAS PROBABLY SIX FOOT FIVE
HE DID KEEP GETTING WOUNDED
BUT HAVING SAID THAT
VERY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE
IT'S A WONDERFUL HOUSE
AND ONE OF THE GREAT JOYS IS THAT IT WORKS VERY WELL NOW
TO LIVE IN AS A FAMILY HOME
IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT DID IN
CAN YOU NOT APPRECIATE THAT GLAZE
BUT BEFORE WE GO
GOODBYE FROM EVERYONE HERE
IT'S AN AUCTION
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A CEASEFIRE IN UKRAINE
A FREIGHT TRAIN CARRYING CRUDE OIL DERAILED IN A SNOWSTORM
PRICES AREN'T RISING AS FAST AS THEY WERE
BURSTING INTO FLAMES
INFLATION IS AT A RECORD LOW
THE FALLING COST OF FOOD AND PETROL ARE BEHIND THE DROP
TWO MEN HAVE BEEN ARRESTED OVER LAST WEEK'S TIPPER TRUCK CRASH IN BATH
THEY DON'T NEED ME
MAYBE ANOTHER TIME
YOU CAN'T TREAT YOURSELF
SO I'VE DONE QUITE A LOT OVER THE LAST TWELVE YEARS WITH THEM
I WOULD EXPECT IT TO MAKE THIRTY
SHAPED AND FORMED IN RELIEF
I QUITE ENJOYED IT
EVERYWHERE WE WENT
LET ME KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
SHE SAID SHE COULD HAVE A KIDNEY INFECTION
YOU HAVEN'T YET REACHED THE AGE OF CONSENT
THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO START
ANOTHER TIME PERHAPS
IF SOMEBODY CAME TO ME AND OFFERED ME A BRAND NEW ONE ON A PLATE
WHEN YOU FINALLY BECOME A SCREAMING ALCOHOLIC
WHAT IS IT THAT SICK PEOPLE DON'T WANT
HOSPITALS ARE LIKE CHURCHES
IF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY WANT PUT A CATHEDRAL THERE
I THINK THE COTTAGE HOSPITAL IS A CHARMING LITTLE PLACE
WHO HAS SO MUCH
I GO ROUND EVERY WEEK AFTER
WHAT CAN HE SAY
I JUST DON'T WANT HIM TO GET IT NEXT TO THE CAMP
YEARS COULD GO BY
THE SEASON'S GOING VERY WELL
NOW THE POINT IS THIS DEAR
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS ALL
FEELING REALLY CRAZY RECENTLY
THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT
THE YOUNG SUFFRAGE ARMY
WHO ARE NOW CALLING THEMSELVES THE BANBURY YOUNG HOT BLOODS AFTER THEIR SPLIT FROM THE BANBURY NEW
I HAVEN'T REALLY DECIDED
IT WAS DURING THE CARNIVAL IN VENICE THE ITALIANS LOVE BABIES SO I LEFT HER WITH A
DO YOU WANT ME OR NOT
THIS IS WHERE I'VE GONE WRONG IN THE PAST
DO YOU OR DO YOU NOT WANT ME IN YOUR GROUP
LET'S GET BACK TO THE VOTING
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO
AND THEN WE MARK THE ROUTES TO AND FROM
SO GET CRACKING
IF YOU CATCH THAT ONE
HOME BY THE SEA FOR RETIRED HORSES
YOU PUT THOSE TWO PILLS IN YOUR MOUTH
NO REALITY FIRST RULE OF COMEDY
TELL YOU IF IT'S NOT ANIMATE
BUT YOU MUST ADMIT
I WANT TO MAKE THAT PLAIN
I' GROWN VERY FOND OF YOU
POUNDS HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED TO ME BY THE CAMP ENTERTAINMENTS MANAGER
IF YOU CONFIRM THIS
THAT'S THE END OF THE MATTER
AND THAT MR MALIN HAS BEEN GIVEN THE GO AHEAD TO EXTEND THE CAMP
THERE WILL BE MANY MORE
BUT SPEAKING AS THE FATHER OF TWO TEENAGE DAUGHTERS
FULL OF COLOURFUL CHARACTERS AND STORIES
SO STAY TUNED FOR THIS SPECIAL EDITION
THE ORIGINAL CASTLE WAS BUILT BY A NORMAN LORD
WHO FOUGHT ALONGSIDE WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR AT THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS
AND FOR HIS SERVICES
THAT SEEMS TO ME LIKE A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE PERK OF THE JOB BY ANYBODY'S STANDARDS
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AT HOPETON HOUSE
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THEY WOULDN'T HAVE LET ME IF THEY KNEW I'D MADE MISTAKES LIKE I I DID WITH MY FIRST
ESPECIALLY IN NORTH AFRICA
WE BOUGHT THE FIRM BACK
BUT BEFORE WE DO
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU
YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THIS IS POSSIBLY MY FAVOURITE PIECE HERE AT DUNSTER CASTLE
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
YOU CAN FIND ON OUR BBC WEBSITE
I THINK THAT'S THE START OF A LOT OF CLEARING OUT
ENJOY THE MONEY
AS I FOUND OUT WHEN I JOINED AN ART CLASS IN GLASGOW
SO I THOUGHT IT'S ABOUT TIME I GAVE IT A GO
OR MINIATURE FURNITURE
A WORK OF ART OF A DIFFERENT FORM
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO TEMPER THAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT IN TODAY'S MARKET
EMBOSSED LEATHER WALLPAPER
WHICH WOULD COST A SMALL FORTUNE
EMBOSSED WALLPAPER BECAUSE IT WAS A CHEAP IMITATION OF THE REAL THING
WE HAVEN'T FINISHED YET
IT'S GOT QUALITY AND IT'S GOT CHARM
I WON'T LIVE LIKE THIS
I WANTED TO PUNISH HIM
YOU KNOW WHAT A SCORE IS
I DON'T SEE THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IF I'D WANTED TO GO CAMPING
I'D RATHER SEE HIM
YOU'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER
THEY USED TO SAY
WELL OUT OF THE BLACK
I MEAN IF YOUR JEANS AREN'T TIGHT ENOUGH
AS WE'RE ALMOST RELATED BY MARRIAGE
THE HARD SELL COMES LATER
MAYBE SOMETHING PLAIN
I BROUGHT YOU UP TO BE AN NORMAL ON
A SKATE REGISTERED NURSE
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
WELL WHAT THE FRENCH CALL
WITH THE DEAL IN THE BALANCE
TYPICAL YOU TED NO SOONER DO WE GET PAID THAN
AND WE CAN HARDLY DO THAT HUMPING THEIR TATTY CASES AND BROWN PAPER PARCELS
PERHAPS WE CAN COME BACK LATER
CHAMPIONSHIP DAYS ARE OVER
I'LL BE DOWN THIS FRIDAY TO COLLECT IT
I'M GOING TO CATCH
SMOKING DOG ENDS
YOU'RE NOT GO TO JAIL
WE'LL FIND OUT WHICH ONES LATER ON IN THE SHOW BUT RIGHT NOW
IT'S THERE TO BE WORN
JEWELLERY WITH INSECTS ON
THAT'S AN UNUSUAL NAME
YOU'RE A WELL SEASONSONED GUIDE
IT'S QUITE A TOUGH TEST
YOU CAN HAVE REPEATERS
YOU'VE GOT TO WEAR IT
AND THERE'S A CLUE
WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY
DONE AND DUSTED
SO WHILE WE WERE IN THE AREA FILMING
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THEM
IT'S DISTRACTIONS AND HIGH EXPENSES
WOULD BE OVER BY CHRISTMAS TIME
LEAST OF ALL THE TWO FRIENDS
SO RIGHT UP UNTIL THE TIME HE WAS IN THE TRENCHES
THE ROAD NOT TAKEN
MAYBE IT WAS FROST'S POEM
IT'S IT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER
A LOT OF THESE ARE SOLD ON SCRAP VALUE
AS WE HEAD OVER TO AUCTION ROOM FOR THE VERY LAST TIME
IT IS BEAUTIFUL
ARE YOU HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS NOW
ONE MORE BI FIVE TWENTY
FIVE SEMIFINALISTS HAVE ALL BEEN HERE BEFORE
THEY'VE EXPERIENCED THE DELIGHTS OF SITTING IN THAT BLACK CHAIR AND TONIGHT THEY HAVE TO DO IT ONCE
THANKS FOR WATCHING
THEN GO TO OUR WEBSITE
I WAS SICK OF BEING EVERYONE'S CRUTCH
SHE SAID THE WRONG THING
MAX SAID HE SAW A LIGHT ON DOWNSTAIRS WHICH DIDN'T FIT WITH THE POLICE STATEMENTS AND
I GAVE LAUREN AN ALIBI
SHE STARTED IT BUT
HE TRIED TO TALK TO HER
WE COULD FORGET ABOUT IT
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHILD
IF I SAID IT WAS BOBBY
IF THE THING'S RESPECTED
THOSE ARE BIG WORDS
AND FOOD WRITER KIMBERLEY WILSON
I TOOK A LONG TIME THINKING ABOUT THIS
THE LITTLE LUXURIES
IT'S FAIRLY SIMILAR
A NEW ARRIVAL BACK FROM THE DEAD
AND WE HAVE A MIND BLOWING PREVIEW OF WHAT IS COMING UP ON EASTENDERS
THIRTY YEARS IN THE GAME AND STILL GOING STRONG
WHAT A SPECIMEN
ONE OF THEM VOTED FOR ARTHUR FOWLER
THIS BUILD UP TO THIS WEEK HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE
BUT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES
I COULD TELL YOU
BUT AS WEVE BEEN GIVEN EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO THE CAST
PRODUCERS AND THE CREW
BUT THE ACTUAL PLANNING FOR THIS STARTED SOME EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO
AND EXHAUSTING EIGHTEEN MONTHS THIS
SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO
PLAYING A DRUNK
I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO JOIN THE FAMILY
NONE OF US KNEW WHAT WAS COMING
THE DESIGN DEPARTMENT
ORE HAS ROUNDED UP MORE BRILLIANT CAST MEMBERS
HE WAS A GENTLEMAN
THROUGH MY SHOP
AND CALL ON ALL OUR FRIENDS
THIS IS TOO BAD
THE FLESH IS WEAK
WITH A RESPONSE RATE BELOW FIFTEEN
CULTIVATING FRUIT AND VEGETABLE
HE AIN'T COMING BACK
I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING LATER
DENISE IS IN THE VIC
AND NO ONE IS WONDERING ANYTHING
I WANTED HIM TO FACE JUDGMENT
I WANTED TO PUNISH HIM
I WAS SICK OF BEING EVERYONE'S CRUTCH
I GAVE LAUREN AN ALIBI FOR GOOD FRIDAY
GOT TO THE POINT I WANTED IT TO HAPPEN
WHICH DIDN'T FIT WITH THE POLICE STATEMENTS AND
HE TRIED TO TALK TO HER
WE SAID HE TRIED
I'D BE TAKEN AWAY FROM MY BOY
IF I SAID IT WAS BOBBY HE'D BE TAKEN AWAY FROM ME
MAYBE WE COULD FORGET ABOUT IT
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHILD
YOU JUST DUMPED HER IN THE WOODS
I'M SORRY FOR I SAID EARLIER
WELL
BUT THE TEAMS CAN'T AFFORD TO BE TOO SLOW
I'M A DANCE TEACHERIR
THANKS VERY MUCH
BOTH PHONES AREN'T ANSWERING
IF WE FIND SOMETHING STARTLING
IF I CAN BUY IT IN THE FIRST PLACE
MEANWHILE WE'RE HEADING OFF TO KENT
SOMEWHERE JUST SO INTERESTING
IT'S A WEAPON TO PROTECT YOURSELF
BUT WHAT'S UNUSUAL ABOUT IT
LEGENDARY IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
RETAIL FOR TWENTY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH JA
THE RED TEAM HAVE GONE FOR A MIXTURE
OVERALL MINUS SEVEN
YOU'RE WORKING FOR A CLIENT AND EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE A STYLE
YOU HAVE TO ADAPT IT TO YOUR CLIENT'S NEEDS AND TASTE
THE WHOLE FAMILY ARE AFFECTED BY THE FACT THAT THEY CANNOT AGREE AND CANNOT GET THIS PLACE
I'M PRETTY SURE
FARM I FEEL A BIT SICK
FOR ME THE FULL EFFECT IS WHEN EVERYTHING IS DRAWN
AND I'M NOT SURE HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK WITH LUCY
WHETHER SHE'S GOING TO BACK DOWN A BIT
WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE EQUAL PEGGING
VERY HARD TO TELL AT THIS STAGE
I HOPE THEY'RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
I HATE WALLPAPER WITH BUMPS UNDERNEATH IT
I HATE OLD FASHIONED WALLPAPER
BUT IT'S FLAT IN THE GOOD SENSE THAT YOU CAN SWITCH IT UP AND CHANGE IT FROM TIME TO TIME
I CAN FEEL THAT HAPPENING
LOOK AT OUR SITUATION TOGETHER AS A CO ROOM
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ON THE GREY ON THE WALLS AS WELL
ALL THE FAMILY COMING BACK IN
THE STATUES ALL THERE
HOME AND NOW IT'S A HAPPY ENDING
TO BE WHERE EVERYONE WANTS TO HANG OUT
NO MORE JESS BEING EMBARRASSED BRINGING HER FRIENDS BACK
TO BE A HUB OF THE HOME
WITH SOME THINGS I DIDN'T EXPECT
IS THE WEEPING ANGELS
SO THEY NEED TO WORK WITH PASSION AND EXCITEMENT
I GUESS I'M A BIT VIGOROUS
BUT I'M WORRIED THAT SHE'S COMMITTED HERSELF SO SOON THAT SHE'S GOT A VERY DENSE
THAT'S A KEY WORD
FOR ME AS A DAIRY FARMER
I BLAME THE PROCESSOR BECAUSE HE CANNOT SEE THE BIGGER PICTURE
MILK A COMPLETE FOOD
A KEY PRODUCT THAT MANY USE TO JUDGE THE VALUE FOR MONEY THEY'RE GETTING FROM A SHOP
I JUST WANT TO BE OUT IN THE LANDSCAPE AND THEN
WHICH IS THEN PROCESSED
AND THAT'S WHERE MUCH OF THE PROFIT COMES FROM
YEAH THERE'S PROBABLY GOOD PROFITS THERE
THIS IS A SPECIALIST TEAM
IT'S ON THE MOTORWAY
IT COULD BE APPLIED TO SOMETHING LIKE A LIVESTOCK TRANSPORT
IF THAT WAS INVOLVED IN A ROAD TRAFFIC COLLISION
PART OF OUR JOB
OR STUCK SOMEWHERE ELSE
I'VE BEEN A FALCONER FOR MANY
AND THAT WAS ALL I WANTED TO DO
NOT LEAST BECAUSE YOU WERE GRIEVING FOR YOUR FATHER
AND THAT WAS A MUCH GREATER DISTRACTION
THAT WAS LIKE LOSING MYSELF IN THE WILD
COMPARED TO THE CORVETTE'S FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY
WHAT'S YOUR ITUNES PASSWORD
WONDER IF WE COULD DECIDE WHO TO VOTE FOR
ON WHAT THE LEADERS DRIVE
WIND THE WINDOW UP
FERRARI HAS ACTUALLY SAID
JUZZING ON THE FACTS AND FIGURES
PLEASE DON'T LET ME WIN
AS A CAR ENTHUSIAST
TO BUY SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE
I WENT I WENT FOR A FEW BMWS AND THEN I DECIDED
PEOPLE ALWAYS GOT
THE SHELLS THEY MADE WERE EXCELLENT
THE GERMANS ARRIVED
HE LACED HIS FACTORY WITH EXPLOSIVES AND BLEW THE ENTIRE PLACE TO SMITHEREENS
VERY GOOD AT IT
AND TO FIND OUT JUST HOW BRILLIANT
JEREMY AND I ARE GOING TO DO AN EXPERIMENT
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK
BAD WEB DEVELOPERS
AS OF ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO
IT'S BEEN DEVELOPED TO TARGET A LARGE TARGET AUDIENCE
MY NAME IS DAVID AND THIS IS SHAUN
PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN
IN TERMS OF REVENUE AND SALES AND PROFIT
WHICH INCLUDES THE COLLAPSE
SO AS PART OF THAT
WE'VE COME UP IN AN AGREEMENT WHERE HE'S GOT THE IP AND ONCE WE PAY HIM THAT MONEY
AND THERE'S A BUSINESS HERE THAT'S TURNING OVER A MILLION
RING FENCING THE COLLAPSE
HOW DOES THAT SOUND
SO COULD ANYONE SUCCEED WITH A NEW TAKE ON THIS OLD PRODUCT
OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEURS THINK THEY CAN
AND MORE THAN EXCITED
CAN'T WAIT TO GET STUCK IN WITH IT
WITH THE NAME GRANNY MARMALADE THAT EVOKES VALUES AND TRADITION AND
I DON'T THINK YOU CALL SOMETHING GRANNY MARMALADE
WHICH IS SOMETHING VERY TRADITIONAL
WE'VE WORKED HARD TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE GINGHAM
WE HAD IT A FARMERS' MARKET
ONE ISSUE I HAD
AND THE REASON WHY I WON'T SUCCEED
AND THERE ARE NICHE PRODUCTS APPEALING TO A NARROW MARKET
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEURS ARE IN THE NICHE CATEGORY
WITH A SPECIALIST PRODUCT FOR BOAT OWNERS
IF LEGISLATION CHANGED
BUT WHO WOULD YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO INVEST IN
TELL US YOUR VIEW ABOUT THAT ON TWITTER
USING THE HASHTAG DRAGONSDEN
ANYWHERE IN ENGLAND
CALLING TO EACH OTHER
IT IS JUST THE SAME STORY
DOESN'T MATTER WHO GETS IN
THEY'RE QUITE CONVINCED THEY CAN DO IT
AND THEY COULD IN THE LONG TERM
THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION WHO THOUGHT UKI WAS RACIST WAS VERY MUCH BIGGER
AGAINST ANY COMMENT ANYBODY MAKES
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY NEGRO
THEY WOULD BE BULLIED
THEY WOULD BE PICKED ON
AND I WASN'T BROUGHT UP WITH THEM
WHY IS SHE LIKE THAT WITH THEM AND NOT ANYBODY ELSE
UM THEY ALWAYS TALK TO ME
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
COME BACK AND GIVE US YOUR BEST
IS THAT MARTIN HILL WHO WAS IN THE NATIONAL FRONT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
WHO IS A THREAT TO THE ESTABLISHMENT
WHEN IT' IS THREATENED
UKIP IS THE UNDERDOG AND THAT'S WHY UKIP IS GOING TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL
GET UKIP WHATEVER
HOWEVER YOU CAN
WHATEVER WAY YOU CAN
WHAT ELSE COULD I SAY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY JEWISH
AND SHE THEY GOT THE BIT RIGHT ABOUT MY DESCRIPTION OF THEM AS NEGROES
I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR UKIP NOW BECAUSE OF THAT
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IS OUT ENJOYING THEIR YOUNG MANHOOD
I COULD HAVE BEEN ANYTHING
BEING SO HUNGARIAN ABOUT EVERYTHING
DON'T TALK TO HIM
YOU PROTESTING WHEN YOUR DIVIDENDS ARRIVE
HOW OLD ARE YOU
THAT HOUSE IN EHA GETTING TOO SMALL
AM THE COMPANY AND I PUT YOU WHERE YOU ARE
IF YOU WANT THIS REFRIGERATION PLANT
WE NEED YOU HERE
I'M A SELF-MADE MAN
I'LL TAKE THEM ON SINGLE HANDED
EVERYBODY ELSE ON HIS BOARD HAS
I DO MOTHER BUT I'M FIGHTING FOR A PRINCIPLE
HE ME OUT OF THERE BEFORE LONG
I MAY HAVE GIVEN UNCLE GREVILLE THE IMPRESSION THAT WE
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU
CLOCK AT NIGHT WHAT DOES HE FIND
THE ENTERTAINMENTS MANAGER
AS YOU COME THROUGH
THIRTY COME INTO CAMP
GOT UP AS A CAMPER
PUNCH TRIED TO HIT COPPER THREE TIMES
I THINK HE MEANS MALE AND FEMALE
SHE'S A KNOCKOUT
SHE'S WHAT I CALL A YELLOWCOAT
PUT HER IN CHARGE AND TELL HER TO SHARPEN UP THE REST
I THINK IN SOME MEASURE
I WANT TO SEE ALL YELLOWCOATS IN HERE AT TWO O'CLOCK SHARP
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THE OTHER SIDE IS BARE BOARDS
NO MORE NONSENSE
I WANT ALL THIS PUT RIGHT
I NEVER DO NOTHING
EVERYONE IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
THAT IS GOOD NEWS
AND GOODBYE TO YOU TOO
YES THAT'S RIGHT
GINGER FROM SO
THIS STUFF WILL DO THE TRICK
YES REALLY NICE
SOMEONE WANTS TO KILL YOU
THE FLATTER THE BETTER I ALWAYS SAY
I HATE ROUND THINGS
I LOVE FLAT THINGS
IT'S JUST ORDINARY EMULSION PAINT
WELCOME TO MY TATTOO SHOP
DO YOU DO INCOME TAX ADVICE AS WELL
LIKE A SPATCHCOCK CHICKEN
ARM REFLECTION WE SHOULD HAVE USED A DELICATE CYCLE AT THE VERY LEAST
HAND ME THAT THROW FROM THE SOFA
HOW DO I SAY THIS
BUT I SUPPOSE THAT'S CLARKSON
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS AND GET FLAT
WE'RE QUITE SERIOUS
HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO SOMETHING
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE'S ABOUT TO CHANGE
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS
IT WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT DECISION I'VE EVER HAD TO MAKE
WE USED TO BE BEST FRIENDS
NATALIE WAS GETTING PICKED ON AT SCHOOL BY THESE MUCH OLDER GIRLS
WHEN I GOT BACK
GIVEN WHAT I'VE JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT MY RECENT HOLIDAY EXPLOITS
THAT REMINDS ME
MAIDENS STILL WEARING CLOGS AND SHOALS
DO IT IN MY DOORWAY
EVERY SHOPKEEPERS PREMISE NEEDS THE BENEFITS OF AN EFFICIENT AIR HUMIDIFIER
YOU CAN NEVER FIND A CAB IN THIS TOWN
IN MY EXPERIENCE
THE BLACK WIDOW
BACK FROM HIS LITTLE FATHERING
I COME ACROSS SOME VERY FUNNY PEOPLE ON MY WAY HOME
STOCK AND BARREL
I SHALL SURVIVE
YOU YOU'LL GET THE BULK OF HIS FORTUNE
WE SHOULD HAVE PRAYED HARDER
DESPITE WONTA HIMSELF
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT
WELL I'M TELLING YOU SO THAT
I'D HAVE TO RESIGN FROM MY CLUB
I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IN MARRIAGE
VERY LIKELY ATTRIBUED TO MY OWN SHORTCOMINGS BUT UNDOUBTEDLY NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS
IF YOU'RE NOT OUT OF HERE IN ONE MINUTE
WE MUST HAVE HARD FACTS
YOU NEED A SIGNED STATEMENT FROM SOMEBODY
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW
ON THE NIGHT OF EIGHT OF JUNE AT TWELVE
THE DOOR CLOSED AND THE LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED
OR DID I NOT SAY
THAT GIVEN THE RIGHT CONDITIONS
IF YOU'RE BOTH GOING TO KEEP WORKING TOGETHER
WHAT I SAID ABOUT WHITNEY
TWO PEOPLE SWALLOWED UP BY A PAVEMENT IN SEOUL
BUILDING WORK MAY HAVE BEEN TO BLAME
FOOTBALL BOSSES HAVE RECOMMENDED MOVING THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO TOURNAMENT TO NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER BECAUSE OF THE
MARIA PROBABLY NEEDS TO TAKE THE HINT
WE HAVE TRIALLED THIS DEVICE ONCE BEFORE
BUT IF I HEAR ANYTHING
HE HAS ADEQUATE COVER
WE HAVE THE THEATRE SPACE
THINK AIR AMBULANCE SERVICE
THINK MARY CLAIRE
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK
WHAT ABOUT MY DAUGHTER
SHE'S FIVE YEARS OLD AND WE ARE TESTED NOW
TAKE YOU TO THE BEST RESTAURANTS
PAY FOR EVERYTHING
THOU HELP US
I'LL HAVE TO CHANGE JOBS
OR GIVE UP WORK
THEY HAVEN'T OFFERED TO HELP ME
AND I WOULDN'T TAKE ANYTHING FROM THEM IF THEY DID
FIND OUT JUST HOW BAD HIS DEBTS ARE
I'M NOT HYSTERICAL
I THINK FRANK WAS SELLING FAKE PRESCRIPTIONS TO DRUG ADDICTS
THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE BETWEEN US
DON'T LET HIM UPSET YOU
EVERYTHING YOU DID WHILE WE WERE AWAY
AND YOU TELL ME I'M NOT FIT TO BE A DOCTOR
AND THAT I SHOULDN'T GIVE UP
BUT IT'S OK CAUSE I'M GOOD AT IRONING
BUT LET'S FACE IT
THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT
WELL IF YOU WANT MORE MORE ACTIVE
YOU ALWAYS GET A PAPER BANK
ESPECIALLY ON MY BUT BIRTHDAY
WELL WHAT'S WRONG WITH OLD STOCK
THEY STILL GO BANG
ATTRACTIVE WIDOWED LADIES BUFFETED LIKE MYSELF ON THE COLD WINDS OF
AND DON'T LIE TO ME
I USED TO SAY TO HIM
WHEN IT COMES TO RUDE AND MERCENARY
I'M AN EMPLOYEE
GRANVILLE WILL GET IT FOR YOU
WHY ARE YOU GOING OVER THERE
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
I GET A LOT OF THAT ON A FRIDAY NIGHT IN THE BALLROOM WITH THE GENTLEMAN'S EXCUSE ME
IT'S ABOUT THEM HORSES
AS YOU SO QUAINTLY PUT IT
THEY'LL PRINT THE COMPLETE STORY WITH A COPY OF THIS LETTER
YOU MIGHT CLICK
I WAS HORRIFIED
OVER MY DEAD BODY
THEY REALLY LISTEN
I'M REALLY HAPPY
AND THE NEXT THING WE KNEW
WHICH HELPED HIM A GREAT DEAL
BUT ACTUALLY IT PROBABLY IS OVER AND ABOVE
BUT SO MANY SPECIAL THINGS HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THAT SPECIAL LITTLE BOY
WHEN I RETURNED
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
AND I WIN BY THEM
I WILL BE IN THE KITCHEN
I'LL DO THAT ON THE NIGHT
I'M GOING TO BE IN THE DIRTY PRINCESS
OVERCOME WITH PASSION
IN THE HAM DRAM
YOU MUST READ THIS
WHERE THE REDS MEET THE BLUES AND I GET TO MEET THEM ALL
AND IT WASN'T THE GREATEST TWO
BUT THEY ARE QUITE SWEET
IS IT GOOD NEWS
AND I DAREN'T GO AND ASK FOR ANY MORE
SO I REALLY HOPE THEY COME BACK WITH THAT RHINO AND LACKING IN SOME MONEY
HAVING GOT THIS SINGLE ROOM IN HIS FRIEND AND PUBLISHER'S HOUSE
IT HAD TO BE FURNISHED
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
ASKING TO STAY FOR HEY
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE NOW
I THINK IT'S ON THE HOT SIDE
DID YOU SPEND THE LOT
I WANT TO BE A DAD
ESPECIALLY NOT IN JANUARY
I AM DONE WITH DREDGING
TRACEY MADE OUT LIKE SHE WAS GIVING ME MY LIFE BACK
IT'S ALL ABOUT HER NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE ANOTHER KID
IS IT WORSE FOR HER WITH ME WORKING FULL TIME
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT IN COMMON
I NEVER WASTE ME MO
WE'VE GOT A LOT IN COMMON
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT
MAY REST IN PEACE
THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN ME MONEY
MAKING ME NERVOUS
WHY DO I ALWAYS GET THE SMOOTH TALKERS
YOUR OWN SISTER
EXECUTIVE IF YOU DON'T MIND
LOOK HOW OLD I AM I'M ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO ENJOY IT
THE STATE HE'S IN
SHE'LL BE HERE IN A MINUTE TO PICK HIM UP
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY AT THE TIME
THAT YOU'RE NOT USED TO BEING STOOD UP NO
WOULD YOU CONSIDER AN OLDER MAN
YOU CAN PLEASE YOURSELF
ALL MY HOPES DASHED AGAIN
SHE SHE DID LEAVE A MESSAGE
CAMP HE HI
DON'T SIT NEXT TO HIM
SITTING IN A BUS
OFF WITH THE OLD
I THINK I'LL GO FOR A BRUNETTE
RIGHT DOWN HER BACK
THAT'S NOT FAIR
WHEN THE RIGHT ONE FOR ME COMES ALONG
SHE'LL HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOUR
THIS ONE'S ROTTEN
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL JEFF IF YOU WERE A STAR PLO AT CAMBRIDGE
FRANCOIS SAYS I'VE GOT A LOT OF TALENT
THAT GIRL'S DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE
IT'S DRASTIC THEY WON'T LIKE IT
WE OUGHT TO PUT A RESERVE ON IT
IT'S BEEN IN HIS FAMILY A LITTLE WHILE
AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW HAS SEEN ONE BEFORE
THAT'S WHAT AUCTIONS ARE ALL ABOUT
LANCE CORPORAL JOSHUA LEAKEY EARNED THE VICTORIA CROSS FOR EXCEPTIONAL BRAVERY DURING A FIRE FIGHT
AND MADONNA GRABBED THE HEADLINES AT THE BRITS BUT FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS
JIMMY SAVILLE ABUSED SIXTY THREE PEOPLE AT STOKE MANDEVILLE HOSPITAL
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU'RE A CELEBRITY
YOU WERE RIGHT TO BE SUSPICIOUS
AND I'M NOT HAVING YOU LYING ALL OVER IT
IF ONLY OCCASIONALLY
WEARING NOTHING BUT MASKS
ONE MULTI FUNCTION
WILL YOU LET ME FINISH
QUITE ENOUGH TO HAVE THE FULL OUNCE
WE'RE DOING IT FOR HER OWN SECURITY
WITH ALL THESE DIVORCES ABOUT
LONGER IT'S THE USUAL SATURDAY PROGRAMME
OLD CAMPERS FAREWELL AND
NEW CAMPUS HELLO
AFTER MUCH HEART SEARCHING I DECIDED
I JUST POPPED IN TO LOOK AT SOME FIGURES
YVONNE AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALL SUPPORT HIM
SHELTERING FROM THE BLAZING SUN
IN THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE
JUMPING UP AND DOWN
AND WHEN THE COLLECTION PLATE
IT WAS PILED HIGH WITH SILVER DOLLARS
LIKE SHOW BUSINESS
BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S ON THE COLLECTION PLATE
YOU COULD WHIP IT BACK TO YOUR SHELLEY
I WANT YOU TO DO ME A FAVOUR
IT COULD DO WITH IT
WELL I KNOW WHAT TED WILL DO
WE'VE GOT A FANTASTIC CROWD
MORE THAN I'D EXPECTED
AND IT REALLY IS TOUCHING TO SEE THOMAS' INITIALS
PEOPLE BIDDING WITH ANY LUCK
ALL FIVE OF OUR CONTENDERS HAVE BUT ONE THOUGHT ON THEIR MINDS CAN THEY MAKE IT THROUGH TO THE
THERE WILL BE A TIE BREAK
AND YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON TWITTER
THANKS FOR WATCHING
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A CONTENDER IN THE NEXT SERIES
DO GO TO OUR WEBSITE
I'M ALL OVER THE PLACE TODAY
I THOUGHT YOU WERE FROM THE FUNERAL PARLOUR
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SIGN THE BOOK

WHAT I SAID ABOUT WHITNEY
I THOUGHT YOU WERE FROM THE FUNERAL PARLOUR

HANG ON TO THEM OR PUT THEM INTO AN AUCTION
SOME THINGS DIDN'T SELL BUT
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO GIVE UP NOW
HE'S BRINGING A MR FLETCHER TO LOOK AROUND THE HOUSE
WE'RE BOTH VERY AMBITIOUS
SHE'S ONLY A TENANT
SHE'S A PROTECTED TO
SHE DOESN'T ANSWER HIM ANYWAY
THOSE OLD PLACES ARE BEYOND REPAIR
YOU'RE ASKING TOO MUCH
I WONDER IF YOU COULD SPARE ME A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OF YOUR TIME YOU SAID WHAT
I JUST AM GOING TO BE TOTALLY HONEST
THE BAGS UNDER THE EYES
AH JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
HOW I'D DONE THAT
I'M GOING TO PUT THE EYES IN AND THEN I'M GOING TO WORK AROUND AND PUT THE COLOUR ON AND I CAN
INSIDE HIS HEAD
REALLY FREELY AND NOT GETTING TOO TIGHT
HE SAW KATE DRAW AN OBJECT
YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO CONCENTRATE
OR THEY CAN HOME STRAIGHT IN ON THE FACE
IF YOU LOOK AT A REMBRANDT SELF PORTRAIT
AND THEY UNDERSTOOD MORE ABOUT
BECAUSE IF WE THINK BACK TO THE LAST TASK
IT'S ALMOST AS IF
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND LEAVING US NOW
I THINK THE ARTISTS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATING ACROSS ALL THREE CHALLENGES THEIR STRENGTHS AND SOME
THAT'S IT FOR THIS WEEK
YOU'RE NOT DRIVING
YOU'RE HEADING TOWARDS AN ACCIDENT
IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
BECAUSE WE'RE ANIMALS BUT
TO LOOK AFTER OURSELVES
AND SOMETHING WENT WRONG
THE PRODUCERS DECIDED THAT ONE OF US SHOULD BE DUMPED SOMEWHERE WITH MINIMAL KIT
WITH VIRTUALLY NO FOOD
VERY REMOTE TO SEE IF THE SYSTEM WORKS
THE SKINNY ONES WITH THE POINTY TOPS
I LIKED ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR CAR
NOT ON TOP OF A MOUNTAIN AT MINUS TEN
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN THIS FILM AND
SAW THE BRUSH OFF
BUT THAT'S REALLY NOT TRUE
SOME ARE REALLY LARGE
IT'LL MAKE YOU SLEEPY
I THINK HE'S RIGHT
SOMETHING YOU NEED TO PUT RIGHT
HE WAS JUST BABBLING
I WAS ONLY NEAR A FEW MINUTES
WELL I EXPECT YOU FORGOT
WELL I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT HE SAID
AND READY TO GO
HE'S GOT FIVE HUNDREDWEIGHT OF FISH FINGERS COMING DOWN ON THE THREE
YOU'RE TOO EASY GOING
I'VE JUST TOLD MR FAIRBROTHER THE BA FACT
SHE FLASHES HER EYES
WE'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THAT
I JUST TOLD YOU TO ILLUSTRATE HOW DIFFICULT MY PROBLEM WAS
MY FINAL SOLUTION IS THIS
CAN'T BE SARCASTIC
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL
THE DREADED JOAN WAINWRIGHT
WHATEVER SHE WAS THEN
THEN WE'LL ALL WAIT
I'M NOT STARTING WITHOUT HER
THAT'S VERY SLOPPY
WHICH HAD ONE OF THESE GAUGES
WHAT'S THIS THING WORTH
IT COULD BE YOURS TODAY IN A FIELD IN DERBYSHIRE FOR FIFTEEN
I'M PHILIP CAUTIOUS SARAH
AND WAS MADE PROBABLY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
THIS THING IS SO PRECIOUS
FREE NAILS WITH EVERY STYLE
IS THIS ABOUT JOHN BERRY
I THOUGHT I WAS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE SAID TO YOU
BUT I THINK WE OUGHT TO CALL A DOCTOR FRANK
TONIGHT WAS THE LAST STRAW
YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
NONE OF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
I'M TERRIBLY STUCK WITH THE LAST SCRIPT OF THE SERIES
AMONG OTHER THINGS
SORRY ABOUT THAT
HOW WHEN IT'S DARK ALL YOU'LL SEE IS A DIM OUTLINE
THESE ARE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS
DON'T FORGET IT'S STAG
TALK ABOUT LIFE IN A QUIRKY
CONTAIN MEAT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO GO FOR PET FOOD
YOU MAY WELL LOOK AT THE FLOOR
TOTALLY DISHONEST ALWAYS COME OUT ON TOP
YOU GO AND LOOK AFTER NANCY
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
AH ROLF HARRIS HAS BEEN STRIPPED OF HIS CBE
THE HONOUR WAS ANNULLED AT THE ORDER OF THE QUEEN
HE WAS JAILED IN JULY FOR SEX ATTACKS ON GIRLS
A BABY WEASEL RIDING ON THE BACK OF A FLYING WOODPECKER
YOU JUST WORRY ABOUT THE TROLLS
I WAS JUST TRYING TO SAY
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU
WE'VE ONLY HAD THE HOUSE FOR THREE MONTHS
AND SOMETIMES HE CAN'T SWITCH OFF
BUT HE IS A BRILLIANT NURSE AND A GOOD MAN
IT'S ALWAYS WITH YOU
I'LL PROBABLY GET IT WHEN EVERYONE'S BETTER
I DON'T KNOW MUCH
A FEW NIGHTS AGO
WE HAD AN ARREST THAT WENT WRONG
YOUR BRILLIANT IDEA OF GETTING IN HERE TO TRY AND GET THEM BACK
WHICH MAKES SENSE
BUT HE'S BLAMING YOU FOR EVERYTHING ELSE
YOU ASKED ABOUT IT
YOU FOUND OUT IT HADN'T BEEN COLLECTED AND NOW IT'S GONE
YOU GOT TO HAVE REALITY
FOLLOWED THAT WITH THE MIDGET AND THE GIRAFFE
AND WE HAD TO GO STRAIGHT ON AND DO OUR SPRING IN PARK LANE FANTASY WALTZ
BUT I WAS SO EMBARRASS I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO PUT MY FACE LET ALONE MY FEET
I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM
UM BUT HOW DO WE MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH
THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH
I WATCH THEM EVERY AFTERNOON IN THE KIDTY FILM SHOW
BUT I AM QUITE SURE THAT YOU'RE CLEVER ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT AUDIENCE
WITHOUT RESORTING TO
WE ALWAYS HAVE TO SHARE
EVERYBODY DOES IT
QUI AND SINCE YOU HAD A GOOD LOOK YOU
WELL WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT
SHE'S A BRILLIANT AMBASSADOR OF OUR CAUSE
SHE'S A WONDERFUL
CAN'T YOU CONTROL YOUR SON
CAN YOU CAN YOU DO ANY BETTER
WHEN I'M DEAD AND GONE
I LOVE WATCHING THE CHARLESTON WENT STRICTLY
YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
THE BOYS CAN RUN AROUND
DOES SIERRA LIKE DUCKS
HE WON'T GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING
HOW DID YOU KNOW WHO I WAS PHONING
AN NONETHELESS YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS SNOOPING AND YOU CERTAINLY HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING DISCOUR AS
CLOSE OF PLAY TODAY
YOU NEED TO LEARN TO DEAL WITH ISSUES LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'VE CREATED THEM
I DON'T SIT THEM
YOU WEREN'T WRONG AT ALL THERE
YOU BELIEVED I COULD DROP LITTER
I AM RAISING MY SON
I WANT MY COAL SHED DOOR BACK
WE HAVEN'T GOT A BROWN TEAPOT
IN PREVIOUS OCCUPATION
I'M ALL FOR CHIVALRY
I DON'T AGREE WITH MARRIAGE
I DIDN'T NEED IT
I'M TALKING ABOUT WOMEN
THERE'S NO COMMON MEETING GROUND
MY FAMILY WERE ARMY PEOPLE
AND THE NEXT MORNING
WE WE JUST CHANGE INTO OUR NIGHTCLOTHES AND AND READ OR PLAY CARDS ALL NIGHT
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE BACK
I THINK IT'S UP TO YOU TO WEAVE YOUR MAGIC ON THE ROSTRUM
I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE SELLING THIS
I KNOW PEOPLE CHECK IN HERE FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS BUT
NOTHING MUCH HAS CHANGED
IF HE SAID TO A PATIENT
AND THE BLOODS GO TO GO AWAY FROM IT
AND IT'S JUST REALLY CAUGHT MY EYE
YOU REALLY WANT TO WATCH YOUR MOUTH
TODAY HE WAS JAILED FOR TRYING TO JOIN ISLAMIC STATE EXTREMISTS IN SYRIA
DAVID CAMERON'S DENIED HE'S RUNNING SCARED OVER THOSE TV ELECTION DEBATES
HE'S RULED OUT A HEAD TO HEAD WITH ED MILIBAND SAYING HE'LL DO JUST ONE DEBATE WITH SIX OTHER PARTY
AND THEN TRY TO APPLY THAT TO THE CHOREOGRAPHY
ARE WE FINISHED NOW
BY THE END OF IT
AND IN THAT CAPACITY I SAY WELCOME
PAY ATTENTION AND WE SHOULD HAVE A SAFE AND
I'M A BOYFRIEND
WHERE'D YOU GET IT
THEY'VE FIXED THE DAMAGE TO YOUR KIDNEY
FIVE SEMIFINALISTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN HERE BEFORE
THEY HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN
AND YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON TWITTER
ARE YOU SERIOUS
SO WHILE WE GENTLEMEN BOND
YOU GO AND LOOK AFTER NANCY
SHE'S GOT THREE KIDS BUT THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY FINE
ARE YOU SERIOUS
YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING
I'M DEEPLY SORRY
THAT IS THE LAST NAIL IN MY COFFIN
I'VE HAD OTHER PATIENTS WITH THE CONDITION
THE THE IMPAIRED MUSCLE FUNCTION
YOU SHOULD BE OUT IN FOUR DAYS
I'VE FOUGHT FOR EVERYTHING I'VE GOT IN LIFE
I FOUGHT TO MAKE THE SOCIETY AS GOOD AS IT COULD BE
I'VE SENT MAC TO DO A SEARCH
I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO FROM TIME TO TIME
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME
IT WAS STRUGGLING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND THE ISSUE WAS DRAWING AND THE
THE COMPETITION IS BECOMING MORE INTENSE AND NEXT WEEK IT WILL ONLY GET TOUGHER WHEN WE COME FROM
ANOTHER ONE OF ADRIAN'S YOUNG WORKERS AND
IT'S PENHAM IN RURAL HEREFORDSHIRE
I COULD ADD ANOTHER
IN VERY BASIC TERMS
IT'S A WAY OF GETTING A HOME AT LESS THAN MARKET VALUE IF YOU MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA
IT ALL DEPENDS HOW YOUR INCOME RELATES TO LOCAL HOUSE PRICES
AND FOR RURAL SCHEMES IT REALLY HELPS IF THE APPLICANT HAS SOME LINK TO THE VILLAGE
BUT DEVELOPERS NEED TO MAKE MONEY
WHERE'S THE BALANCE THERE
IT'S MAINLY THEIR BEHAVIOUR
OUR WAGES AREN'T AS AREN'T AS GOOD AS THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING TEN
BUT HE CAN'T AFFORD THE MARKET RENTS IN INKBOROW
AS WE ARE AT THE MOMENT
TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WE INHERITED THE LOWEST LEVEL OF BUILDINGS SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY THREE
SO WE WANT TO FREE THEM UP
TO GET DEVELOPERS IN THERE BUILDING HOMES
WHAT HAPPENS IN PRACTICE IS THAT PEOPLE BORN AND BROUGHT UP IN THE VILLAGE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE
ADAM HAS BEEN LEARNING SOME FARMING LESSONS OF HIS OWN
BECAUSE WE GET RID OF THE TREES
FARMERS ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO PRODUCE A LOT OF FOOD IN THE COMING YEARS
AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT SUSTAINABLY AND SENSIBLY
BUT AS SOON AS WE DO HAVE ONE
AND A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
WE REPORTED THAT FERRARI WERE WARMING TO THE IDEA OF A TEST TO SEE WHICH IS THE FASTEST THE FERRARI
THEY TALK TO ANTI CAR LOBBY
HE ALSO SAYS THAT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE DECISIONS ARE IN CENTRAL LONDON AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF MIDWIFERY
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
REMEMBER TO SWING THROUGH THE BALL
THE THREE OF US TRIED OUR HAND AT AMATEUR RALLY CROSS
AND WE DECIDED THAT
BECAUSE WE ENJOYED THE AMATEUR EVENT SO MUCH
OUTSIDE OF TURN ONE
IN YOUR HEADSET
FROM THE START LINE TO THE FINISH LINE
ALL THE DRIVERS DRIVE AS FAST AS THEY CAN
SEE HIM WHEN HE SAW ME
I MIGHT HAVE A BREAKTHROUGH
IT'S HIS JOB TO LIKE YOU
I'VE BEEN BLACKLISTED
YOUR AUNT LIKES YOU
FATHER O'HARA LIKES YOU
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A BIT OF WORRY ABOUT HER MOTHER
YES BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE WRONG
JUST MY LITTLE JOKE
BY THE TIME YOU READ THIS
I WANT EACH MEMBER OF STAFF TO MAKE A SPEECH ABOUT YOURS TRULY
KNOW BEING A DAB HAND AT ALL THAT HISTORICAL STUFF
COMPARE ME WITH THE GREEK GODS
GET BERT SWANLEY AND THE DEBBONAIRS
PULL THE STRING
AND I STAND THERE
WATCH YOUR BACK
THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT JOE MAP A GREEDY CROOK
STARVING AND IN RUGS
WE DON'T NEED TO DO IT AGAIN
THE CAMPERS WILL HAVE NEARLY FINISHED THEIR DINNER
WE THINK IT SHOULD BE SHORT
JOE MAPLIN IS A FAMOUS CITIZEN OF THIS LAND
WHEN WE GET INTO THAT OFFICE
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT
WE NEED MORE TIME
AND TODAY AT THIS PRECISE HOUR OF ELEVEN
WHERE ELSE COULD FLOG IT BE
I'M I'M A COLLECT OF OTHER THINGS
YOU'RE WATCHING THE RIGHT SHOW
WORKING WITH HIS HANDS
JOHN THOMAS AND I WORKED TOGETHER
MAKING THIS SORT OF QUALITY GLASS
I WOULD SAY TO THAT BUT
I'M PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY GERALD
SURROUNDED BY WELHO
I WONDER IF THAT'S BECAUSE
JULIE ASKED ME TO DO IT
IT'S A PROMOTIONAL VIDEO
MY PANTIES ARE DRYING IN THE KITCHEN YEAH
IT'S IN THERE AND IT CAN'T GET OUT
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO SAY STUFF
LATER ON IN THE THIRD ACT
I'M SURPRISED YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE ME
WHAT IS THE NATURE OF YOUR CRISIS
THEY ARE REALLY SMALL
HE'S EATEN THEM QUICKLY
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THIS BUT MICHAEL CAINE HAS NATURALLY FRIZZY HAIR
BUT WITH A LITTLE KINK
WITHIN NO TIME AT ALL
I HAVE WRITTEN A BEAUTIFUL SONG
IT TURNS OUT THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE REAL MAGS FLAHONEMAN STILL REMAINS A MYSTERY
CARRYING THREE LOCAL MEN ON ITS BACK
PRESUMABLY TO TAKE THEM UP TO ITS LAIR AND STICK PROBES UP THEIR ARSES
LIVE OUTSIDE JULIE'S BISTRO WHERE THE ENORMOUS MOTH TYPE CREATURE IS HURTLING TOWARDS THE
SO I'M STILL GOING TO STAY WORKING IN MARKETING BUT I'M COMPLETELY CHANGING SECTOR SO I'M GOING TO GO
IT'S BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO A LABYRINTH OF SMALL
SO I COULD I COULD DO THAT FOR TWENTY FIVE
WHAT FLOATS YOUR BOAT WHEN IT COMES TO COLLECTING
ALL PRETTY GIRLS TOGETHER HAVE TO BUY PRETTY THINGS
BUT NOW YOU'VE MADE YOUR DECISION
THAT'S YOUR LOT
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE FOOTHILLS OF SURREY TO CLANDON PARK
WE'VE GOT TO PAY THAT
WE'VE GOT TO BUY THIS
SO I THINK I'D BE HAPPY WITH THAT
HE WAS GOVERNOR GENERAL AND HAVING A FONDNESS FOR THE MAORI PEOPLE
AND WHERE DID THE FEATHERS COME FROM
THEY CAME FROM THE KIWI BIRD
THE EFFECTS ON THE LOCAL POPULATION WERE CATASTROPHIC
BEING A DIPLOMATIC FELLOW AFTER ALL
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY
ALMOST AS EXTRAORDINARY
IF THEY GO WITH IT
WE'VE GOT THREE POTENTIAL IMMEDIATE PROFITS THAT IS THE PRICE PAID VERSUS
THAT'S THREE OFF
I'M NOT CONSTANTLY JUMPING FOR JOY BUT
THIS YOUNG LADY SAVED YOUR LIFE
KNOW GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF DOUBT
I'M HERE BECAUSE A WEEK AGO
HOW COME I JUST HANG OUT WITH THE SAME FIVE OR SIX
IT'S AS IF I WAS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD AGAIN
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
THE NEW MANAGER
HOW DID YOU MESS THAT UP
HE'S PINCHED MY WHISTLE
YOU'VE CERTAINLY BEEN VERY ACTIVE
PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE
JUST AS I WAS GOING TO BED
THAT BORING CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER SAYS WE NEED TO EXPORT SO I'M EXPORTING
I'M STARTING UP A VENUE FOR YANK HOLIDAY MAKERS ON AN ISLAND AT BAHAMAS
HIHIING UNDER A PALM TREE IN TWO WEEKS FLAT
I JUST THINK I OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED
SOME TIMES GETTING ON
PLEASE EXCUSE ANY
I COULDN'T READ IT
AND INTRODUCED BY A DIFFERENT MEMBER OF THE STAFF
THERE THE SP
SUPPOSING BY SOME FLUKE OF CHANCE
I DO MANY OF THOSE BORING YELLOWCOAT DUTIES
INSTEAD OF A POLICEMAN
I WOULDN'T GO IF THEY ASKED ME
OUR AGENT WAS SUPPOSED TO READ IT
I WAS LOOKING FOR ONE HUNDRED
THE OWNER KATH IS ON HOLIDAY
AND I'M HERE TO MEET SERGEANT PAUL JOHNSON TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE SECTION DOES
THEY ARE A GREAT ADDITION TO THE MODERN DAY POLICE FORCE
YOU TRUST THOSE THINGS WITH YOUR LIFE
THE WAY THEY MOVE
WHO WANTS TO LOOK AFTER A MAN
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY HERE TODAY AT THE FLOG IT VALUATION
I THINK WE SHOULD RESERVE AT THE BOTTOM FIGURE
SO IF IT GETS TO ONE FORTY
ONE FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED AS AN ESTIMATE
WE CAN'T DO ANY MORE TALKING
WELL THAT'S WHAT YEAH THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
EVE'S ROYAL WORCESTER VASE
BUT EVERYONE HAS TO PAY THAT
IF YOU'VE GOT ANYTHING LIKE THAT AT HOME
ANOTHER GREAT SHOW
THEY ARE SO COLLECTABLE RIGHT NOW
PROPER JUICY ONES
THEY JUST KNOW THAT YOU'RE THEIR MUM
COMMUNITY SERVICES AND CARE HOMES ARE BEING BROUGHT TOGETHER IN ENGLAND
FIVE MILLION NHS PATIENTS COULD BENEFIT
JEREMY CLARKSON'S BEEN SUSPENDED FROM TOP GEAR
THE BBC SAID IT WAS AFTER A FRACA WITH ONE OF THE SHOW'S PRODUCERS
THE MOMENT TWO HELICOPTERS FILMING A REALITY TV SHOW COLLIDED
JUST BECAUSE WE'VE FOUND OUR NICHES
BEAR WANTED TO VISIT
SO THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON
WHEN A PATIENT DIES
AND WHEN SHE DIED
BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL
I DON'T SEE WHY
IT'S A WORK OF GENIUS
IT'S INCREDIBLY DRY
MUCH LARGER THAN ANYONE WE COULD EVER POSSIBLY IMAGINE WERE TO PASS RIGHT THROUGH THIS ROOM
BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT THE HOT BIG BANG MODEL
AND WE ALSO TALK ABOUT THE HOT BIG BANG EVENT
I WAS AWARE THAT THERE WAS A PIECE OF IT THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND YET
IN ADDITION TO THE ORDINARY MATTER AND RADIATION WE KNOW OF
BUT IT DOESN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH
AND SO THE BEST PLACE TO OBSERVE IT
TO LOOK FOR VERY FAINT SIGNALS
AND DURING THOSE NINE MONTHS HE'LL WATCH THE SUN GET LOWER AND LOWER ON THE HORIZON AND THEN
TO THE SOUTH POLE
IT MUST BE A PROBLEM WITH OUR INSTRUMENT
IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU COULD
ALTHOUGH MOST OF SPACE IS REMARKABLY EMPTY AND THEREFORE WE CAN MAKE A LOT OF MEASUREMENTS OF THE
WE CALLED A COLLABORATION WIDE MEETING AND ABOUT HALF OF US WERE CALLING IN FROM THE SOUTH POLE
WE LIVE IN A GALAXY
TO BE SURE THAT IT WAS REAL
IN QUOTATION MARKS
WITH THAT TITLE
THERE'S BEEN A FLURRY OF ACTIVITY TRYING TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE SOURCE OF THE DETECTED B
AND BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WAS AVAILABLE
WHOSE UNCERTAINTIES WERE RATHER HARD TO QUANTIFY
IT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE A LARGE FRACTION
NINETY PERCENT OF THE SIGNAL
IF ITS IF IT WAS A FALSE HOPE
BUT AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BUT THERE'S A BIG UNCERTAINTY ON THAT SEVENTY FIVE
IT'S BECAUSE I'M NERVOUS
MY SISTER IN LAW
ALL THOSE DECISIONS
THE PROS AND CONS OF PLAYING BRIDGE
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DISCUSS BRIDGE TACTICS
MAYBE I SHOULD MOVE IN WITH DOROTHY
I DON'T WANT TO
IT WOULD DRIVE ME MAD
I FIND THE DITHERING QUITE DISTRESSING AS WELL
WE GET A LOT OF STRANGE MEN IN HERE
NOTHING SEEMS TO GO RIGHT FOR US
I DON'T JUST MEAN THAT BUT
NOT TOO MANY AT THE MOMENT
IT'S NOT WIDELY KNOWN
MY MOTHER ONCE WENT OUT WOULD
IT'S NOT YOUR CAR
SO YOU MUST BE EXTRA CAREFUL
SHE'D BEEN LAUGHING NOW
IF SHE DIED TWENTY YEARS BEFORE
NO ONE HARASSING YOU
OUR LIFE'S JUST STARTING
BUT WELL I'M A CREATURE OF IMPULSE DEFINITE SO
ON THEIR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY
AND LIGHTING YOUR WAY TO THE FUTURE
I'M HAPPY TO SAY
BUT YOUR CANDLESTICK WAS AN ENORMOUS SUCCESS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
AND IT IS OF COURSE IN HIS OWN WORDS
CHADS IS EVERYWHERE
SO IT'S FINGERS OUT AND EYES OPEN TIME
THERES ONLY ONE MAN UNDERSTANDS MY BACK
ZOE MAY NOT NEED ME BUT
WHY THE YEAH WHY THE INSIGHT THEN
PLEASE ASK THE BILL PAYERS PERMISSION
THAT WAS A SPIRITED PERFORMANCE
AND YOU KNOW WHEN I SIT HERE I ALWAYS THINK MY DAD'S LOOKING DOWN ON ME AND
THE RESULTS WILL BE ANNOUNCED DURING COMIC RELIEF THIS FRIDAY
THE ONLY REASON WE'RE ALL HERE IS FOR COMIC RELIEF
PLEASE BE WARNED
POS TEXT THE WORD DANCE
AS A HUGE STRICTLY FAN
YOU MUST BE SIXTEEN OR OVER
PLEASE VISIT BBC
I THOUGHT THE PART OUT OF HOLD WAS BEAUTIFUL
WHEN SHE WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR
THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE HELPED
THROUGH HER EXPERIENCE ON THE PEOPLE STRICTLY
AND WHEN SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE FUN ANYMORE
MY LIFE IS ALL ABOUT FUN AND ENJOYING IT
THAT'S MY JOB DONE
THEN HEAD TO BBC
BUT TONIGHT YOU GET THE FINAL SAY
YOU CHOOSE THE VERY FIRST WINNERS OF THE PEOPLE STRICTLY FOR COMIC RELIEF
MAKE SURE YOU TUNE IN FOR WHAT PROMISES TO BE A FANTASTIC NIGHT OF TELEVISION ON OVERC ONE FROM
WE ARE ABOUT TO OPEN THE VOTE
BUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING ON CATCH UP TV
YOU DON'T HAVE LONG
SHE WAS ALWAYS INTO GREEN ISSUES
WHEN WE WERE GETTING READY FOR HER TO GO TO SECONDARY SCHOOL
I WAS ALWAYS REALLY CONCERNED FOR HER
SHE WAS A VEGETARIAN
AND FOR SOMEBODY LIKE SO FAIR
AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE
ONE OF THESE BOYS DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEEN WITH SOPHIE AND ROB BECAUSE OF THEIR APPEARANCE
THEY WERE MOSHHO AND
SOPHIE AND ROB WENT TO MEET THIS GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE
ARE THEY MORALLY OUTRAGED BY WHAT WE WERE
FIVE BOYS WALKED INTO THE PARK
WHAT'S GONE ON THERE
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID
SHE'S A WITNESS
I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST
YOU CAN ALSO HEAR ROB COMING ROUND
DID THEY DO DRUGS
THEY COULDN'T TELL WHICH WAS THE MALE AND WHICH WAS THE FEMALE
MUMBLING TO HERSELF
WHAT IS GOING ON
SHE'S GRAVELY ILL
THE FIRST REFERENCE TO THE BORESTONE IS FROM SEVENTEEN TWENTY THREE
SECOND WHICH IT'S LOOKING GOOD FOR
IT'S VERY BIG STONES IN IT
WHY DON'T WE FIND OUT
NOW FOR THE BLUES
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
I THINK IT'S WORTH ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF ANYBODY'S POUNDS
NOW WE COME TO THE COMMAND SITUATION EXERCISE
WHICH EQUALS FOUR
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU LAST SAW YOUR
HAVE YOU NO FEELINGS
YOU'VE BEEN ROBBED
EVERYBODY'S DOING IT
ACCORDING TO THIS
I'M NOT WAITING ON YOU AND FOOT THIS SUMMER
WHEN IT WAS THE LONDON NORTH EASTERN
I'VE GOT A LOT OF NEW IDEAS
AND I'M GOING RIGHT TO THE TOP
AS SOON AS IT FILLS UP
WHICH IS THE BEST
WHICH MY OLD DAD SAID
IS THE VERY EVIL IN OUR MIDST
AND I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL
I'M FED UP WE'RE LOOKING AT OLD THINGS
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM FOR SEVEN MONTHS
I GO THE CHALEY
HE WAS EVER SO PLEASED TO SEE ME
HE FLICKED HIS EARS UP
MY FATHER WAS AN INSPECTOR
WHICH CONSISTED OF SOFT FURNISHINGS
WHEN HE RETIRED
I DON'T WANT TO BE A WET BLANKE BUT
I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT A VERY FUNNY THING THAT HAPPENED TO ME ON THE WAY TO THE POOL TODAY
I KNOW HE'S VERY BUSY
I WANT TO SEE THEM ALL IN HALF NOWHERE
IF I AM RIGHT AND I DO GET THE JOB
WHY SHOULD HE WANT TO COME BACK HERE
HE'S A BRILLIANT
I THINK HE HAD A LOT OF RESPECT FOR YOU
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO DEEPER
WE'VE GOT A PAIR OF LIGHTLY LOOKING EXPERTS
WE'RE IN THE HISTORIC TOWN OF DERBY
THIS WAS ONCE A ROMAN TOWN
AND THEN LATER IT BECAME A MAJOR VIKING AND SAXON SETTLEMENT
AND I'VE ALREADY FOUND SOME WONDERFUL ITEMS
WHAT'S YOUR NAME
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING IN JUST
LET'S HOPE THAT LITTLE BLACK POT WITH A YELLOW LID IS AROUND FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS
RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME TO JOIN UP WITH OUR EXPERTS BACK AT THE VALUATION DAY
I THINK YOU'VE GOT IT ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON
NOT MINE BUT I TELL YOU WHAT
I WAS FEELING DOWN
IF YOU DO HAVE SOMETHING
THEN I'D APPRECIATE IT
YOU NAUGHTY MAN
I BETTER GET BACK
I WANT TO BE THERE FOR MY MUM AND MY DAD
SHE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON
THE BAD DAD WITH THE LOOSE MORALS AND
IT'S NOT BEEN SOME MAD GRUBBY THING
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OUR FUTURE
AND WHAT PEOPLE GAVE
THE COUNTRY IS UNITED BEHIND SUPPORT FOR OUR ARMED FORCES
A PARTICULARLY BUSY PERIOD IN THE AFGHAN CAMPAIGN
WHEN IT WAS OPERATING
AND DURING THAT TIME
VERY SLICK WITH OUR PROCEDURES PROCESSES
GOOD TRAINING BEFORE GOING OUT AND
WE HIT THE ROAD RUNNING AND
WE WILL REMEMBER THEM
BLESSED ARE THE POOR IN SPIRIT
FOR THEIRS IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
FOR GREAT IS YOUR REWARD IN HEAVEN
FOR CIVILIAN WOMEN
BUT IF YOU WANT TO DROP OFF AN EARLY MORNING SAMPLE
I DIDN'T MEAN IT
I'M NOT THE TYPE TO ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING
I'M GETTING BETTER AND BETTER
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO
PERHAPS IF YOU WROTE TO THE GOVERNOR
HE'S UNEMPLOYED AS WELL
YOU LOOKED AFTER THAT FAMOUS BANK ROBBER DIDN
IF YOU DO ANY COOKING
THEY'RE ALL ROUND THE BACK OF THE HOUSE
IT'S BEEN VERY QUIET
THAT'S THE WORD
ORGANISED BY MY COMPANY
THE ACCOMMODATION WAS BAD
YOU'VE JUST ARRIVED BACK
YOU TELL ME OFF CAUSE
THE SAFER SOCIETY WILL BE
FULL OF CONTRITION
BY ALL THAT'S HOLY
YOU REALISE WHAT THIS MEANS
THINK ABOUT ALL THE LITTLE THINGS YOU'VE DONE FOR ME
DON'T JUST DANCE WITH YOUNG MEN OF YOUR OWN AGE
ME MOTHER SAYS POWER CORRUPTS AND TOTAL POWER CORRUPTS TOTALLY
I PICKED AT THE SECOND HANDLAW SHOP IN TOWN
ALWAYS REMEMBER THE BRITISH RESPECT A BEEN CLASS
YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY WITH A CHARACTER
DESPITE BUT IT'S STILL NOT RIGHT
THINK ABOUT WHAT I'VE SAID
THERE WERE TWO JOBS
GLAD YOU REMINDED ME
I WAS FRESH COMPLEXIONED
EAGLE EYEED AND ALL RANGY
I WAS STILL SHORT
AND ACCORDING TO A FOX
POLICY WISE THEY'RE GOING YOUTH WISE
YOU'RE THE SPORTS ORGANISER
IT ALL BUILDS UP INSIDE THEM
I'M NOT ONE FOR PIE JAWS
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ENTERTAINING CAMPERS
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET YOUR NEW ENTERTAINMENTS MANAGER
BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST ISN'T
JUST CALL ME CLIVE
I WENT ROUND TO HIS SHEEY TO GET IT
HIS CHECKBOOK WAS EMPTY
YOU MIGHT THINK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE BRITISH COASTLINE
COMES FROM THE HEART OF THE BLACK COUNTRY
WELCOME TO DUDLEY
WE'RE HERE TO HUNT DOWN SOME ANTIQUES
AND I TELL YOU WHAT
EVEN IF THEY'RE ONLY TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU THIS MORNING
QUITE DESIRABLE IN TODAY'S MARKET
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF AUCTIONS
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
HE EVEN SHARES HIS BIRTHDAY WITH THE VEHICLE
SO HE'S GOT A WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE
IT'S GREAT TO MEET UP WITH YOU
I CAN EXPORT THAT AND THEN WE CAN GET ENOUGH STEEL TO START BUILDING ROVER CARS AGAIN
CAN READ THE GROUND AHEAD OF THEM
PROBABLY ONLY FIFTY TO HUNDRED METRES
TO UNDERSTAND WHERE YOUR STEERING WHEELS ARE POINTING AND TO GENERALLY BE IN THE RIGHT GEAR FOR THE
IT'S JUST FANTASTIC
IT'S GOING TO GO ON INTO THE FUTURE
IT'S A GREAT BRITISH ICON
IT'S VERY LOVELY
NOTHING UNTOWARD WENT ON
IF THERE'S NO INTEREST
TILL THE NEXT TIME
THE USUAL RULES
NINETY SECONDS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND TWO MINUTES ON THEIR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
THANKS FOR WATCHING
CELEBRATES LOCAL TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES
I HAVE A WIFE AND EIGHT KIDS
LET'S PUT THIS INTO AUCTION WITH A VALUE OF TWO TO THREE HUNDRED POUNDS
BUT IF YOU WERE TO SORT OF PUT IT IN THE BACK OF THE WARDROBE
THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING
AND THE MAN HOLDING COURT TODAY
LET'S ASK HIM TO JUDGE ONE OF OUR ITEMS
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT IT GOES FOR
I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT ANY LONGER
BUT I DON'T SEE THAT AS BEING THE CASE
I TOO SOON TO BE OUT
HAMMER'S GONE DOWN
THEY ARE PRETTY
THROUGH TO THE FIRST
I HOPE YOU'RE WATCHING RIGHT NOW
THE COUNTRY IS UNITED BEHIND SUPPORT FOR OUR ARMED FORCES
AND THOSE WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY INJURY
FOR GREAT IS YOUR REWARD IN HEAVEN
BLESSED ARE THE POOR IN SPIRIT
FOR CIVILIAN WOMEN
OUR RISEN REDEEMER
IF THERE IS ANY DOUBT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
SHE FELL ASLEEP
AND SHE IS THE ONE GETTING THE BLAME
THIS WILL FORCE CONNIE TO BACK DOWN
PUTTING HER LIFE AND THE LIFE OF A CHILD IN DANGER
BUT CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT WHEN
FROM WHAT I SEE
NOBODY'S TALKING TO YOU
SHE JUST RANG ME ON THE OFF CHANCE
THIRTY QUID ONE WAY
I'M NOT LETTING THE PAST GET IN BETWEEN ME AND ZOE
I'LL TALK TO HER MYSELF
YOU'VE GOT THREE AMAZING BOYS WHO LOVE YOU TO PIECES
THEY DON'T CARE WHO YOU WERE OR WHAT YOU DID
NEW AND YOU JUST WATCHED ME CARRYING ON
ZOE MAY NOT NEED ME BUT
WHY THE WHAT THE INSIGHT THEN
I WAS FEELING DOWN
IF YOU DO HAVE SOMETHING
THEN I'D APPRECIATE IT
YOU NAUGHTY MAN
I WANT TO BE THERE FOR MY MUM AND MY DAD
POISONING HER AGAINST YOU
SHE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON
AND ONE LAST THING
THE BAD DAD WITH THE LOOSE MORALS AND
IT'S NOT BEEN SOME MAD GRUBBY THING
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OUR FUTURE
YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY FAMILY
WELL I DID TRY TO PHONE YOU YESTERDAY BUT FRANK WAS HERE AND I'D RATHER HE DIDN'T KNOW WELL
NOT UNTIL I'M SURE
I LOOK AFTER YOUNG CHILDREN IF THEIR MOTHERS ARE IN HOSPITAL OR THE PARENTS CAN'T COPE
IF THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY
WOULD WE BE ABLE TO MANAGE
I'M HELPING THE WELFARE PEOPLE
I KNOW YOU NOT LOOKING AFTER OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN BUT
YOU'LL BRING IT HOME
IF YOU'VE MADE UP YOUR MIND
I HAVE ON CALL TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY
FOUR INCLUDING TED
AND THE HUMAN VOLCANO
REAL QUALITY WHICH IS QUITE BEYOND MY
GILES BRADSHAW HAD BOTH
AND SHE'S OUT OF WORK
I BOXED FOR THE ARMY
THEY'LL SEE ME FOR WHAT I AM
MY MIND WAS IN TURMOIL
I'LL KEEP THE FIVE
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT
IF I GET WHAT I WANT
I WAS DOING FIND THE LADY
PARTRIDGE IS IN A TERRIBLE STATE
ALL THE CREW HAD BAILED OUT
EXCEPT MY NAVIGATOR
CHANGED MY SUIT
PUT MY WALLET ON THE TABLE
WE MUST APOLOGISE FOR THE FACT THAT DURING THE A JINX YESTERDAY AFTERNOON
IF I GET WHAT I WANT
IT'S FULL OF CURVES WHERE WE DON'T EXPECT THEM
AND TRYING TO SUGGEST THAT ON PAPER OR WITH A PAINTBRUSH IS REALLY
AND FOR THIS CHALLENGE
IT'S LOOKING RATHER ABSTRACT
WHERE THEY HAVE JUST THREE HOURS TO CONVEY THIS
THEY CAN INTRODUCE AS MANY FIGURES AS THEY WANT
EVERY MARK COUNTS
I'M NOT SAFE WHATSOEVER
THE BEST WAY TO GET AROUND WASN'T BY ROAD
SO THERE'S A GREAT POTENTIAL
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HERE ARE VERY
BUT THE REAL BRAGGING RIGHTS BELONG TO THE RACE WINNERS
PO FOR A BRIDGE REPLACEMENT LIKE THIS
I THINK WE'RE WE'RE AT A TIPPING POINT NOW
POUND A YEAR TO US
YOU MIGHT SNIFF AT THE IDEA
PEOPLE MAKING PROFITS
ADAM IS GOING TO BE ON THE ISLE OF MAN LEARNING ABOUT THE LEGACY OF ONE OF OUR FORGOTTEN
SHE IS THE CONSUMMATE COMPAR
THE QUEEN OF COMIC RELIEF
CAN YOU SAY QUIET
WHICH IS A GREAT GIFT FOR ANY ACTOR
WHEN CASINO ROYALE WAS FIRST SHOWN TO A TEST AUDIENCE
THERE WAS ONE SIGNIFICANT ISSUE
AND I QUOTE HERE
THE GUY LOOKS AT ME
I'VE GIVEN YOU THE PAPERWORK
I'VE TOLD YOU WHY I'M HERE
THAT WE WILL ENJOY
AFTER TEN YEARS IN THE DEN
MAN AND DIRECTOR OF HER BETRAY SKIPS
I'M IN THE BUILDING TRADE
THE REALLY SIMPLE WAY FOR
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
THEY COST ABOUT FOURTEEN
AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LESS
AND BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFICULT
ENTER MATTHEW HINKLEY AND ELLIOT SUITER
WE NEED YOUR INVESTMENT TODAY
WHERE YOU'RE PLACING YOURSELF IN THE MARKET
I WISH I DIDN'T FEEL THE WAY THAT I DO BUT
IF I'M TALKING TO ANYBODY OR TALKING THE PRESS
WHAT AM I DOING
PLEASE GIVE ME SEVENTY THOUSAND

JOINING BEN ELTON
STARTED
UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM
ON THE WOGAN SOFA
HERE'S SOMEONE WHO BITES LUMPS OUT OF SONGS
THE MELLOW BELLOW OF
THE OSCAR WINNING ACTRESS ANNE BANCROFT
COULD A COUPLE BE MORE DIFFERENT
WHEREAS MEL TALKED NINETY TO THE DOZEN
WHO WON A BEST ACTRESS OSCAR IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOR THE FILM MOONSTRUCK
I THINK OUR GREAT DREAMS WERE JUST TO KEEP WORKING
WE HAD OUR EIGHT BY TEN GLOSSIES WITH ALL THIS MADE UP STUFF ON THE BACK
WAS WAS THERE A GREAT DEAL OF YOURSELF IN THAT
AT THE BEGINNING
I HAD NEVER PLAYED A ROLE THAT QUITE THAT THAT DEMANDING
AND AFTER A WHILE
AH YOU PUNCH SOMEBODY LONG ENOUGH
THAT MAKE ME STRETCH
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ANYONE WHO DECIDED THAT
AND THE FIRST SUPERMAN
AND I WAS PAID QUITE WELL FOR THAT AND
BUT I'VE DECIDED SINCE THEN THAT ONE CAN DO THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU'RE PAID MONEY
OBVIOUSLY FOR IN A BIG BUDGET FILM
AND YOU'RE YOU'RE PAID TO TO BRING A KIND OF A LIFE TO IT
THE GREAT GENE HACKMAN THERE
AFO TIME OSCAR WINNER
THE COMPOSER HENRY MANIN

WE'VE GOT GENE HACKMAN
A MAN NOT KNOWN FOR MAKING MANY TELEVISION APPEARANCES
WHEN DID YOU START ACTING
WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN AND A HALF YOU SEE
HE CAME BY FOR A CHAT WHILE OVER HERE FILMING SUPERMAN TOO
I NEVER HAD ANY LARGE GOALS AS AN ACTOR
FROM A BROADWAY SHOW
AND WARREN THEN REMEMBERED ME FROM THAT
WHEN YOU MEET NOW
IT WAS ONLY ONE LINE
SHE BEGINS BY TALKING ABOUT THE VERY EARLY DAYS OF HER CAREER
BUT I DON'T SEE MYSELF
AH YOU LOOKING SO BEAUTIFUL AND GREGORY PECK LOOKING SO EXTRAORDINARILY HANDSOME
WHICH I'D NEVER REALLY DONE BEFORE
THE HAND AND THAT
ONE OF THE LAST SCENES IN THE PICTURE
I WON'T SAY A FEW HOURS
WE'RE NOT GOING TO STAY HERE ALL NIGHT
LIKE IN FUNNY FACE OR MY FAIR LADY
THERE WE GOT AUDREY HEPBURN'S TAKE ON THAT FAMOUS SCENE FROM ROMAN HOLIDAY
THERE WAS A CALL
SO LET'S GET THE GREAT GREGORY PECK'S VERSION AS WELL
I KNEW EXACTLY WHERE HIS OFFICE WAS
IT WAS SIX BLOCKS AWAY
AND AS YOU'D EXPECT
SO MANY PEOPLE'S FAVOURITE ACTOR
GETS YOU EVERY TIME
SO WE'LL CALL A CLOSE ON THE PROCEEDINGS
YOU DIDN'T GO IN TILL FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE END
I WAS TWO HOURS IN SHOCK
I DIDN'T KNOW I'D HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT
I DON'T WANT TO BE A VIRGIN FATHER
WE DON'T WANT ANY GOSSIP
NOW I'M GOING TO DEBATE
BEFORE WE COULD POSSIBLY OPEN YOU AN ACCOUNT
PHOTOGRAPHY IS VERY MUCH PART OF SHOW BUSINESS
IF THE ROYAL SHAKESPEARE COMPANY GIVE ME SUITABLE PARTS
MY RESERVES OF PHILANTHROPY DEPLETING
I WONDER IF SHE'D LIKE A TWODAY FASHION SHOOT IN THE SECHE
WHICH MEANT THE EXPANSION OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND THEY HAD ASPIRATIONS
WHICH WERE BACK IN FASHION
TO THE RIGHT EXPERT
BEAT ME TO THIS BUT
BRING THEM ALONG TO FLOG IT
I'M HAPPY WITH THAT
IT'S A THOROUGHLY MODERN PUBLIC SCHOOL
COVERING ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS
I THINK I ENJOYED SCHOOL LOOKING
WHEN I WAS WRITING THE BOOK
THAT'S WHERE QUEEN VICTORIA WOULD ARRIVE BY HORSERA CARRIAGE
BIG ON ON JOINING THE PUBLIC SERVICE
WHETHER IT WAS THE ARMED FORCES OR WHATEVER
I'M A HOUSEKEEPING MANAGER
SOME THINGS FLEW OUT
MARGARET LIKES IT
LAST MAN STANDING WINS
I PUT MY FINGER INSIDE THE GREYHOUND
AND WHEN IT'S OVER
SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE
ESSENCE OF BELGIAN FARM HAND
WHAT BETTER PLACE
AND SHARON LIKES JEWELRY AND SILVER
ANY SHOP IN THE WORLD
WE'RE HEADING OFF NOW SOMEWHERE REALLY RATHER MARVELLOUS
LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
YOUNG AND MO
WE ARE NOT GOING WITH IT BUT
THAT'S THE SPIRIT
WE'RE GOING WITH THE BONU SPIN
YOU WERE MINUS TWENTY NINE
AND IT WAS SLOWLY CHOKING HIM TO DEATH
WHEN I ASKED WILLIAM TO CALL AN AMBULANCE
HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE A MOBILE
BECAUSE SHE'S CRAZY
SHE WORSHIPED THE GROUND ANTHONY WALKED ON
I ONLY SAW HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS
IF YOU SAW HOW SHE LOOKED AT ME
HOW HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT
AND IN MY SPARE TIME I PRACTICE MARTIAL ARTS
I'M AN EMPLOYMENT LAW SEMINAR PRESENTER FROM BEDFORD
EVIL'S NOT THE RIGHT WORD
GUIDING THIS PLANET AT THIS TIME
WAS IT WAS IT A GREAT SHOCK FOR YOU TO DISCOVER THIS AT THIRTY EIGHT
SO I'M DELIGHTED THAT THERE'S SO MUCH LAUGHTER IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT
DESPITE ALL THE BIG NAMES WE GOT ON OVER THE YEARS
I KNOW WHO I AM
AND WHEN HE CAME OUT
I AM THE SON OF GOD
I AM AN ASPECT OF THE SOUL OF THE GOD HEAD
DAVID WAS KNOWN AS CLEAN CUT BBC SPORTS PRESENTER
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN WRITTEN INTO HISTORY
THEY WOULD HAVE SAID
WARNING PEOPLE THAT THE RULERS ARE REALLY SNAKES
LET'S HAVE SOME MUSIC NOW FROM SOMEONE WHOSE POPULARITY IS UNCHANGED WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME
IT'S BECOME ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE
FOR SOME REASON
THERE IS AN ENERGY THAT COMES FROM A BEING CALLED THE GOD HEAD
IT IS A MASSIVE SPIRIT
AND COMING OUT FROM THIS GOD HEAD
AND ROUND ALL CREATION
IS THE LIFE FORCE KNOWN AS THE LIGHT
AND THESE OTHER ENERGIES HAVE A FREQUENCY THAT IS THE SAME AS ALL THE COLOURS
YOU WOULD STILL BE LAUGHING
WE CREATE AN ENERGY FIELD
THIS IS HOW TELEPATHY WORKS
AN ENERGY FIELD LEAVES ONE BEING AND OTHER BEINGS CAN TUNE INTO IT AND READ THAT THOUGHT
WHEN YOU THINK THOUGHTS OF LOVE AND WISDOM AND OF TOLERANCE AND ALL THE THINGS WE WISH TO BRING
THE MORE THAT IS PRODUCED ON THIS PLANET
THE MORE POWERFUL THAT BEING BECOMES
SINCE HE'S BEEN IN CONTROL
TO PRODUCE AS MUCH OF THIS ENERGY
I'M TEN RIGHT NOW
YOU WERE PROBABLY NINE
PUTS IN ICE CREAM
I WANT YOU TO PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC ENTRANCES WE EVER WITNESSED ON MORGAN
NICHAS CAGE IS THE MAN
HE HAD PLENTY TO SAY
I WAS TEN YEARS OLD
I GOT KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE I WAS YOU KNOW THE CLASS CLOWN
THAT WAS MY NAME
PUT MY COWBOY BOOTS ON
THEY NEVER SCREWED AROUND WITH ME
IF I BE SERIOUS ABOUT HOW YOU ACTMON I MEAN
MAYBE IF YOU'RE COMPARING HIM TO PITCH PERFECT MARIAH CAREY
WE'VE SOME SLIGHTLY SAD VIEWING
THE GREAT GEORGE BEST
BUT THIS ENCOUNTER
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU NOW
TELL ME HOW YOU STARTED IN THE ACTING
WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT FOOTBALL
NOT EVERYBODY HAS YOUR TALENT
MORE INTENSIVE NOW THAN WHEN YOU WERE
MANY GERMAN JOURNALISTS ARE COMING TO TOURNAMENTS AND ENGLISH
WHAT WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE ON TENNIS
GEORGE PROCEEDED TO SEND ME AND THE PRODUCERS INTO MULTIPLE PANICS
I LIKE IT VERY MUCH
TO WHICH WE WILL NOT SUBJECT YOU AT THIS HOUR
THERE WAS NO SUCH TROUBLE WITH TENNIS WONDERKIN BORIS BECKER
BECAME THE FIRST UNSEEDED
AND YOUNGEST WINNER
WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHERS
ARE YOU TAKING MORE ENGLISH LESSONS
WAY BACK IN NINETY NINETY ONE
THEIR FIRST TOP FORTY HIT
DIDN'T STAND OUT THAT MUCH FROM OTHER POP GROUPS
WE'VE GOT MORE NEXT TIME
SAM I'M ABOUT TO BECOME A SUCCESSFUL MODEL
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
EVERYONE'S IN HIGH SPIRITS
THIS IS THE TYPE TO OWN
IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT
WE DID TAKE THIS INTO A TOWNSHIP
IT SURVIVED A FIRE
AND LAND HUNGRY DEVELOPERS
SO THAT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT HAD TO BE TACKLED
ANYBODY CAN PAY TO HAVE A GEORGIAN WINDOW
I'LL PUT THOSE AWAY FOR NOW
MAYBE IN HIS LIBRARY
SHE'S GOT A WHISTLE
IVE GOT MY JOB TO DO
IT'S A DIGNIFIED FUNCTION
CHAIN COME FROM ALL OVER
SOUNDS RATHER FUN
I'M REALLY SORRY IF I SOUNDED NEGATIVE
I'VE JUST BEEN OVER THERE TRYING THAT
I DON'T WANT TO WORK AT THAT SHOP FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
I TOLD YOU THIS MORNING
IT'S AGAINST MY RELIGION
I'M A GOOD MUSLIM
I'M BEING HONEST
I APPRECIATE YOU TELLING ME THE TRUTH
BIG CORPORATE HEAD HUHO
HE RINGS ME AND HE SAYS
GET PATIENT CONSENT
WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT LATER
RENOWNED RESEARCHER INTO GRAVITATIONAL POOLS AROUND BLACK HOLES
YOU SHOULD BE FINE
IF YOU NEED THEM
AND I NEED YOU TO COME ALONG
I'D LOVE HIM TO BE HERE
WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING
THERE'S OFTEN A THIN LINE BETWEEN GLORIOUS SUCCESS AND TOTAL FAILURE
I'M FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD
AND I'M A TOUR GUIDE FROM MANCHESTER
I'M A LEGAL SECRETARY FROM NORTHUMBERLAND AND I'M A PROUD MOTHER TO MY SON
SO I'D LIKE TO STICK TO THE SHORTER ONES
SO HE HAS BEEN HELPING ME A LITTLE BIT
SO I' AFRAID YOU'RE LEAVING HERE WITH NOTHING
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY WITH THE SAME AGAIN
I COULD ON WITH A BIT MORE
THAT MEANS MARTIN HAS GOT TO PRETTY MUCH GET THE EDGE ON THE NEXT GO
CHARLIE BUCKET AND MIKE TV
I WENT THERE A FEW YEARS AGO
WELCOME TO ANOTHER SHOW
I'LL TELL YOU A JOKE
I WAS AT A PARTY THE OTHER NIGHT
IT WAS FOR GYNAECOLOGISTS AND MIDWIVES
IN THIS NEW SERIES
WHERE WE TALK THE TALK AND WALK
HE'S BASED ON A NEIGHBOUR WE USED TO HAVE
IT'S CAUGHT ON WITH THE CREW ALREADY
BECAUSE HE WAS VERY ONE DIMENSIONAL
AND WE JUST SORT OF RUN OUT OF THINGS FOR HIM TO SAY
BECAUSE HE'S SO ONE DIMENSIONAL AND HE'S ALWAYS JUST HORRIBLE ABOUT EVERYTHING AND THERE WAS JUST
IF THIS SERIES GOES WELL
THERE ARE ABOUT FIFTEEN TWENTY DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND
LIKE BENO OR SOMETHING
YOU FOLLOW PEOPLE THROUGH EVERY WEEK
WHO I THINK MIGHT BE POPULAR WITH KIDS
THEY TALK ABOUT THE NEWS QUITE A LOT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
IF YOU SAY TO HIM YOU
WHAT'S THE TIME
IT'S ALL ME EYE AND BETTY MARTIN
THE KIDS ARE UPSTAIRS
I THINK AGE IS GREAT
BECAUSE DAVID ATTENBOROUGH
AND HE ENJOYS IT SO MUCH
BABBLING SILLY THING WITH NO FISH IN IT AND IT'S GOT NO PLANKTON AND IT'S VERY BORING BUT
BUT IT'S SLOW AND IT'S INTERESTING
IT'S NICE TO BE ASKED
AND IT WAS INTERESTING TO GO AND SEE IT
MOST INFLUENTIAL FIGURES IN BRITISH COMEDY
I COULD THINK OF NO ONE BETTER TO WIELD THAT RIDICULOUS MICROPHONE
THAT WAS THE NICE THING ABOUT IT
WE SLEPT IN A DOUBLE BED
THAT WAS ACTORS' COMEDY
I DON'T THINK SO
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE COMING IN
DID YOU ENJOY APPEARING ON THE SHOW
HE GAVE US A HARD TIME
WHAT HAPPENED WAS
WE WERE GOING TO DO THIS THIS NUMBER WITH THE
AND WHEN IT CAME TO DO IT
WHERE ARE YOU GOING NOW
I'M GOING TO LOS ANGELES
IT'S NOT EVERYBODY WOULD WANT TO BE A STRAIGHT MAN
HE CAME BACK ON THE TUESDAY MORNING
AND BECAUSE YOU TOOK AN AWFUL LOT
IF WE COULD GET IT
AND WE USED TO DO THE THE SKETCHES
SOME MORE MUSIC NOW HERE'S HARRY CONNICK JR SINGING IT HAD TO BE YOU
WE ALWAYS WELCOME TALENT WITH OPEN ARMS
I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
THE MORE I GOT THE PAN
FORTY SEVEN YEARS WE WERE TOGETHER
BUT WE HAD SUCCESS I THINK WHEN WE WENT WITH THE MOREMOR SHOW ON ATV
ALAN KING AND BUDDY HACKETT ARE STANDING SIDE BY SIDE
ALAN TELLS ME THIS JOKE
IT'S MY HUSBAND
SEE SOME JOGGERS
BECAUSE IT'S RAINING
AFTER ALAN LEAVES
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU THE JOKE RIGHT
HE JUMPS OUTSIDE
IT'S NOT RAINING
BUT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY UNIVERSAL
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO MAKE YOU MORE COMFORTABLE
THAT LIVER THAT SHE MAKES
ONCE MORE BEFORE I DIE
BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE BEING ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME
I WAS DOING TWENTY EIGHT CITIES IN THIRTY DAYS AND
THE FIRST NINE MONTHS
I WOULD EAT DINNER AND PUT MY DISHES OUTSIDE MY OWN FRONT DOOR
FEATURED IN THE HIT FILM WHEN HARRY MET SALLY
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OVER
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN STYLE
THEY'RE REALLY BRILLIANT TO WATCH
AND THEY DO JOKES I WOULDN'T DO
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
ONE OF THE JOKES THAT THEY WOULD TELL ME
THAT'S ALL THE BEST BITS WE CAN CRAM IN TODAY
TALK ABOUT ALL SORTS
WELL THAT DOESN'T SOUND MUCH BETTER
IT MAY BE FINE I
IF IT HAD FLASHED BEFORE YOUR EYES
ROLLING STONES FANS
TWO TO CAMPAIGNS IN THE FALKLANDS
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
THAT'S RATHER SMALL
AND WHERE WE PUT OUR VALUATIONS TO THE TEST
THEY WERE YOUR PARENTS
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH JANE AUSTEN
YOU SPEND IT ON YOUR PASSION
SANDY'S PASSION IS WOMEN'S LITERATURE
THE PRESENT PHENOMENA OF THE INTERNET
YET WROTE ROMANTIC POETRY AND HERE IN THE COLLECTION
IT'S WELL WORTH A VISIT
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET
FROM ITCHSTOKE
JUST ABOUT TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER
I WILL KILL HIM
HE WAS IN THE CHAEY ABOUT TEATIME AND WE WERE A A TIFF
WHEN HE WROTE THAT YOU WENT AROUND IN LAID' UNDERWEAR
ON NIGHT RAIDS OVER GERMANY
MY CREW THOUGHT I WAS A STRONG
I KNOW THE FEELING
HOW MANY TIMES DID WE TELL YOU TO CALL THE POLICE
THIS WEEK SEES THE UK'S BIGGEST ASTRONOMICAL EVENT OF THE CENTURY SO FAR
ON FRIDAY MORNING
I'M GOING UP TWENTY FIVE
FLYING AT THE RIGHT SPEED AT THE RIGHT ALTITUDE
AND AS WE GAZE AT THE MOON
THIS IS WHAT YOU'LL BE SEEING HOWEVER DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE
IT COULD UP TO NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE SUN WILL BE OBSCURED BY THE MOON THIS
TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILES NORTH OF SCOTLAND IN THE FAIR ISLANDS
WE'LL SEE A TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE
THE FUTURE OF SPACE EXPLORATION HOWEVER MAY NOT BE IN THE HANDS OF HUMANS AT ALL
THERE'S A GROWING FIELD OF RESEARCH INTO DEVELOPING ROBOTS TO REPLACE ASTRONAUTS OR AT LEAST TO DO ALL
OVER IN HOLLAND
THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY'S RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY CENTRE
IS AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF ASTRO ROBOTICS
THIS IS THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY'S MAIN TECHNICAL HUB
IN A SIMPLE EXAMPLE
SO IN SPACE WE CAN DO EXCITING THINGS LIKE FIXING SATELLITES IN ORBIT OR DOING
AND IF IT WAS GOING RIGHT
IT ALL TAKES ABOUT ELEVEN MINUTES
THIRTY SECONDS OF FUEL
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO FIND OUT WHETHER IT WORKED OR NOT
IF WE DON'T CATCH THEM TONIGHT
IT IS NOT A GOOD SIMULATION OF WORKING ON THE MOON
BUT BEING OUTSIDE THE SPACECRAFT AND AND DOING OTHER TASKS
THE LIGHT WILL BE LONG GONE AND WILL NEVER
PLEASE SEND YOUR QUESTIONS IN
THEY BROUGHT BACK BAGS FULL OF MOON ROCK
WIPE MY BACKSIDE TWICE A DAY
WE STILL CAN BE
YOU ARE A SPITEFUL OLD MAN
IF YOU COULD SAY TO HER TWENTY EIGHT
AND IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY UP AND DOWN THE STREET
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY WOULD BUY ISN'T
YOU'VE GOT THE TEAPOT
THE CREAM AND THE SUGAR
IT DOESN'T HAVE A VICTORIA HEAD ON
WE HAVE A WEIRD
IF YOU LOOK UP IN THE ART SALES RECORDS
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH HAS ARRIVED
WELL I'VE DONE MY BEST YEAH
MEANWHILE WE'RE HEADING OFF DOWN THE ROAD
ACROSS THE BORDER INTO SUSSEX TO PETWORTH HOUSE
THE RICH TREASURES INSIDE ATTRACT INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION
THE STAND ITSELF
WHO WAS IMPLICATED IN THE GUNPOWDER PLOT IN SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND FIVE
FOR OUR TEAMS ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THEIR WAY OVER TO THE AUCTION AND DISCOVER
IT HAS TO BE REALLY GOOD
WITH ALL THESE TABLETS AND THINGS
DON'T TALK TO STRANGERS
SUPPOSED TO REPORT IT
AND IF THE MEN CAN'T SEE THAT
I AM GLAD YOU ENJOYED IT
LIKE A FAIRY TALE
EVERY DAY IS A PROBLEM
HE TOLD ME AS MUCH
I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LET'S MEET THE PLAYERS WHO
I'LL BE RACKING UP SOME GOOD MONEY
YOU'RE THROUGH TO THE NEXT ROUND
YELLOW WAS GOOD TO ME LAST TIME
SLOW AND STEADY
I THINK IT'S AN AREA THAT HE NATURALLY PLAYS TO
BASED ON WHAT DEAN JUST SAID BEFORE
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL
CONSTANTLY IN THE PROCESS OF REINVENTION
I JOINED AQUEUE OF THE WORLD'S PRESS TO MEET HER IN CANNES
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
I PREFER PEOPLE TO
GET VERY INVOLVED IN IT
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT I DO AND WHAT
WHEN HE GETS COMPLETELY INVOLVED IN A CHARACTER AND
FOR THAT SIX MONTHS OR WHATEVER
WEIGHING FORTY POUNDS MORE THAN HE DOES
MOTOWN LEGEND DIANA ROSS IS A SINGER WHO'S OCCASIONALLY CROSSED OVER INTO THE WORLD OF FILM
THERE'S ALSO A REPUTATION FOR BOTH BEING MASSIVE DIVAS
TO BE FAIR TO DIANA
UNLESS SHE WAS SWEETNESS ITSELF WHEN SHE VISITED
AND I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
I REALLY DO ENJOY THE WORK
I REALLY PROBABLY SHOULD STAY AT HOME AND BE WITH MY KIDS MORE
I LIKE TO BE ON THE STAGE AND
BUT I HAD DECIDED THAT MY KIDS ARE LITTLE RIGHT NOW
A LOT OF WHAT I DO IS IS
AND THEN I HAVE A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD
SO IT'S EASIER TO LEAVE THEM
BUT THE BOYS TRAVEL WITH ME FOR NOW
MY MOM WAS THERE WITH THEM
SO I KIND OF COMMUTED BACK AND FORTH
YOU HAVE A LOT ON YOUR PLATE
THAT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO REALLY STAY ON PURPOSE ALL THE TIME AND I WANT VERY MUCH TO NOT IGNORE
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR A LOT OF NONSENSE
I THINK THE SONGS FROM THE EARLY DAYS
IT WAS THE MUSIC AND THE KIND OF MUSIC
IT KIND OF REALLY TOUCHED THE HEART
I HAVE SO MANY LOVE SONGS IN MY GROUP OF SONGS THAT I HAVE AND I THINK THE SONGWRITERS KIND OF
THEY WEREN'T ABSTRACT SONGS
VERY SIMPLICITY IN NATURE
PEOPLE JUST STILL LIKE THE MUSIC
SOMEONE WHO REALLY TAKES THE TIME WITH THEIR CAREER
IT WAS MORE A PERFORMER DEVELOPMENT AND ARTIST DEVELOPMENT
CARING ABOUT THEIR APPEARANCE
CARING ABOUT THEIR HOME LIFE
CARING ABOUT JUST ALL THE PARTS OF THEIR LIFE
IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT GOING INTO THE STUDIO MAKING A RECORD AND SELLING RECORDS
I THINK I CAUGHT A LOT OF THAT
I SEE THAT THERE'S A WAY TO HAVE THINGS REALLY
REALLY RIGHT AND MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON WHY THAT IT HAS BEEN
I DO THINK WE HAVE ONE MORE
SO I'M OVER HERE QUITE A BIT
THE SONG I'M GOING TO DO FOR YOU NOW
IF YOU TAKE A LISTEN TO THE WORDS
BUT THAT IS THE PROBLEM
THAT PEOPLE THINK YOU MEAN IT MOST OF THE TIME
BUT I IN TERMS OF
I'M BEING VERY SINCERE WITH YOU RIGHT NOW
AH BUT WHEN I PRESENT A PERFORMANCE
AND MANY TIMES IN MY SONG
I SUPPOSE I HAVE BEEN
A WOMAN WHO MIGHT JUST BE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST STAR OF THE PAST FEW DECADES
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE ALWAYS BEEN POWERFUL BUT
PARTICULARLY AMERICAN PUBLIC FASCINATION
NOT FOR ANY REASON EXCEPT FOR THE GLORIFICATION OF VIOLENCE AND FOR ENJOYING THE FACT OF VIOLENCE
OH'S A GOOD IDEA
WHICH I THINK OUR FILM IS VERY RESPONSIBLE AND DEALS WITH THE SUBJECT IN A VERY FRANK AND
RESPONSIBLE WAY OR YOU CAN
PROBABLY NEITHER ONE OF THOSE
WHICH I THINK IS WAS MUCH MORE HER FUNCTION
IT WAS LIKE BEING ON A RIDE AT DISNEYLAND OR SOMETHING
THIS WOULD HAPPEN
A LITTLE BIT UNREAL
I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING
I INTERVIEWED ANOTHER ACTRESS WHO WOULD GO ON TO FIND OSCAR GLORY
IN THE MUCH LOVED TV SERIES THE DARLING BUDS OF MAY
JUST WHERE HER AMBITIONS LAY
AND IT'S NAMED SUPPOSEDLY
IT IS A BIT LONG
YOU DON'T GO FOR OR IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME ANYWAY THAT YOU GO FOR GLAMOUR GIRL ROLES
I WANT TO BE SINGING AGAIN
I WAS INTERESTED IN YOUTH DRAMA
AND I WANTED TO DO ALL THESE THINGS AND
AND I HAD A CHANCE TO DO THAT WHEN I WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL TO GET MY EQUITY CARD
WELL I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT I KIND OF GO FOR ANYTHING
I WAS THROWN ON TO DO THE SHOW
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET
BUT I WANTED TO GET OUT OF THAT MUSICAL COMEDY ACTRES FOR A WHILE AND TRY AND WORK ON THE STRAIGHT
I HATE TO SAY IT
I WENT TO DO THIS AND
BUT I'M NOT A STAR
WAS COMPLETELY ADAMANT NOT TO HAVE AN ENGLISH UNKNOWN ACTRESS
SOMETIMES ABOVE THE CHARACTER
SO SO MUCH MONEY IN THEM
WHO'S ENJOYED PHENOMENAL INTERNATIONAL SUCCESS OVER THE YEARS
SOMETIMES I PLAY CHARACTERS
SHE FIRST ASSAILED OUR EARS AT A EUROVISION SONG CONTEST AND NOW
SHE HAS HER OWN STAGE IN LAS VEGAS
AN EARLY PERFORMANCE HERE
IT WAS THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
I HAD BEEN FOLLOWING THE BOOK FOR A LONG TIME AND SORT OF FOUND OUT WHICH WRITER WAS DOING IT AND
WHICH I KNOW ARE CONSIDERABLE
THE CHARACTER WAS COMPOSED OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
PROFILES OF DIFFERENT
THERE IS A PATTERN AND THERE ARE MOTIVES AND ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE
THAT'S THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT EVERY SERIAL KILLER
GOING OFF THE RAILS
I WAS ALWAYS WITH A MUCH VERY ADVANCED
HOW DID YOU FEEL
YOU MUST HAVE FELT
IT WAS THAT GREAT ESCAPE THAT YOU LOOK FOR WHEN YOURE YOUNGER
AT FIRST I WAS CLEAN
BUT I YOU KNOW I WAS OFF DRUGS BUT
I LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS AND IT WAS A REALLY HAPPY TIME
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T THEY DON'T LISTEN
BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS DIFFERENT AND EVERYBODY NEEDS A CERTAIN DIFFERENT TYPE OF HELP TO GET THROUGH THEIR
BUT WHEN A YOUNG DREW BARRYMORE CAME ON THE SHOW
KNOWING THAT I WANTED IT SO MUCH
BUT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN I WAS LITTLE
I DARE YOU TO DO THIS
I'M NOT SURE IF I CAN REMEMBER ANY OF HER GREATER FILMS
AH DON'T FENCE ME IN
AND LET'S FACE IT
BECAUSE I COULD FINISH MY YOU
WHICH IS RIGHT NOW CALLED ONE LIFETIME IS NOT ENOUGH
I MEAN WHEN I DICTATED THIS BOOK
ONLY BECAUSE I WANTED TO KEEP MY SCOTTY THEN
WILL YOU MARRY ME
BUT I HAVE TO BRING MY DOG TO TURKEY
GO LAWYER
I COULD HAVE SKIPPED THAT
HE WAS MY DIVORCE LAWYER FROM JACK RYAN
TO MAKE A QUICK EXIT
TIME I WASN'T HERE BUT
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A NEXT TIME
I GAVE HIS MOTHER MY MINO DADDY IN BUDAPEST GAVE ME
BUT VERY IMPORTANT
WHICH YOU ALL HAVE SO MANY
BUT I AM SUCH A JERK EXCUSE THE EXPRESSION
AND THEN WHEN THEY ARE CHAVALISTIC PIGS
WORKING ALL HOURS
YOU'VE MADE THIS ENTIRE BUILDING UNSAFE
GIVE ME ANOTHER COUPLE OF DAYS
LOOK WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO ME
I HAVE WRITTEN TO YOU ASKING FOR THIS BUT
BUT AS YET I HAVE RECEIVED NO REPLY
I KNOW I LEFT THE DOOR OPEN
BUT I CAN'T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY PIECE OF PAT AND POULTRY
I NEED AN OFFICE
WE'VE GOT NO HOT WATER
I'M ON THE TOWER
HE WAS CELEBRATED AS ONE OF OUR GREATEST POETS
WET MORNING LIKE THIS
WITH NO LEAVES ON THE TREES
IT STILL HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL
CLARE'S GENIUS LAY IN HIS ABILITY TO OBSERVE AND RECORD EVERY ASPECT OF NATURE AND ENGLISH RURAL
HE HAD A UNIQUE VOICE
JOHN CLARE WAS SELF TAUGHT
I BET IT DOESN'T RING MANY BELLS
I'VE JUST BEEN JOINED BY MARION AND CHARLIE
YOU SEE A LOT OF THINGS AT EIGHTY TO ONE TWENTY
AND PERHAPS PEOPLE WILL SAY
BUT EVERYONE HAS GONE HOME SO HAPPY
BRING IT TO A VALUATION DAY
SEE YOU NEXT TIME FOR MORE SURPRISES
WHICH WE USUALLY TAKE OFF AT MIDNIGHT
I SWITCHED ON THE LIGHT AND THERE WAS MR PARTRIDGE IN BARRY'S BED
BARRY WAS GIVING ME A TEMPLE MASSAGE
WE ARE A DEMOCRACY
WHY WON'T YOU TAKE ME SERIOUSLY
MAKES A UN HEALTHYY
SEE YOU IN THE MARINE BAR
A WORD TO THE WISE
AND AFTER A NIGHT SHIFT IN HERE
A LITTLE BIT OF PEACE WOULD BE LOVELY
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL REBECCA
SO SAYS A SURVEY INTO THE STATE OF CHILDREN'S TEETH IN ENGLAND
COULD YOU SURVIVE A WEEK WITHOUT SOCIAL MEDIA
TEDDY FROM EAST LONDON TRIED JUST THAT FOR A BBC SCHOOL REPORT SPECIAL
THERE MAY BE AN OCEAN BENEATH THE SURFACE OF PLUTO
AND ALSO TIME LAPSE VIDEOS OF THIS DANCE PLAYING OUT
YOU THINK WE BE ANSWER DEFINITY THE AGE OLD QUESTION OF HOW MANY PLANETS THERE ARE IN THE SOLAR
AND AND BACK IN MISSION CONTROL THEY HAVE A VERY PRECISE ORBIT
SO THERE ARE ONLY TWO OPTIONS
IS WE WENT TO THE MOON
SO IT WAS SUGGESTED BY A FORMER ADMINISTRATOR THAT
AND IT WAS FOUND BACK LAST AUGUST
THAT SINGLE STEP HAS PAVED THE WAY TOWARD A NEW ERA OF SPACE MISSIONS
TOMORROW WE'RE GOING TO REVEAL THE PICTURE YOU'VE ALL CREATED
LET'S POP BACK OVER TO LUCY
WALES TOWARDS LINCOLNSHIRE IS YOUR BEST BET FOR VIEWING THE ECLIPSE
NOW IT'S VISIBLE FOR A FEW MORE MONTHS BUT ONCE IT'S GONE IT WON'T COME BACK FOR EIGHT
SO LIKE MANY COMETS
WITH EXCITING NEWS
BUT ONE WHICH SHOWS THE KIND OF DETAIL THAT YOU NORMALLY ONLY SEE USING A TELESCOPE
THIS FRIDAY AFTERNOON
FOOTBALL AND GOLF
I'M A TELECOM SALES MANAGER FROM WORCESTER
AND I'M FROM TAMWORTH
I'M THE DIRECTOR OF A PUB COMPANY
IN MY SPARE TIME
I ENJOY PLAYING DARTS
I WAS PRETTY GOOD ON IT IN THE LAST ROUND
SO STICK WITH WHAT YOU KNOW
DURING THE RUGBY SEASON
I SUPPORT MY LOCAL RUGBY TEAM
I DO LIKE LOOKING AROUND ANTIQUE PHASE AND SHOPS AND DRAG MY HUSBAND AROUND WITH ME
BUT HE'S GETTING INTO IT HIMSELF NOW
WINNING THEIR AFFECTION OR THEIR RESPECT
NOBODY KNOWS BETTER THAN ME
NOT A BLIND ONE BUT
SHE'S NOT JUST TALKING
ALL OF TODAY'S TALENTED GUESTS HAVE
SO WE SAT THERE
BUT I MEAN I USED TO GO DRESSED UP ANYWAY TO THE CLUBS
THEY DO A PHONE IN THING ON THESE RADIO PROGRAMS AND IT'S SORT OF FIRST NAMES
WHAT AH WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET IS IS THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT BRIAN EPSTEIN
THE LOVELY BRIAN EPSTEIN
WHAT WAS HITLER'S FIRST NAME
THAN POOR OLD LOWLANDERS AND EUROPEANS
YOU SAY SEEING UP HERE
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT IF YOU HAD CONSERVED YOUR BREATH
IF I HAD SORT OF SPENT A LITTLE TIME SITTING DOWN
IF YOU WENT DOWN
FED THEM BY HAND
BUT THEY REALISED THAT THEY WERE EXPECTING BREAKFAST
IT WAS SO MARVELLOUS TO ME MY VERY BEST FRIEND
AS OPPOSED TO FINE NOVELS FOR ADULTS
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT
JUST A SHAME THAT SOME TWIST
AND I AGREE WITH YOU
BUT YOU'VE HAD A PRETTY A PRETTY COLOURFUL LIFE
NICE SORT OF STORY
I DON'T WRITE HORROR STORIES
NOW SOMEONE WHOSE LIFE WAS TOUCHED BY A CLASSIC CHILDREN'S STORY
PERHAPS APPROPRIATELY FOR THIS PROGRAMME
SO IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY'VE DONE AND
BRING SOMETHING TO MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE
IT'LL BE A GOOD DAY
BUT JUST LAST WEEK ONE PERSON CALLED ME TERRY WOGAN
THE YEAR OF ONE OF THE BIGGEST MUSIC CONCERTS IN HISTORY
OF COURSE WITHOUT BOB
BECAUSE HE'S ACTUALLY THERE WITH YOU
AND THEN THE ALL THE BAND AID IDEAS AROUND THE WORLD CUMULATIVELY IS ABOUT SIXTY MILLION
SO ANY MONEY THAT YOU SEND IN TOMORROW
HERE'S A SONG THAT PLAYED A BIG PART IN THE FIRST EVER SPORT RELIEF THEN IT WAS RENAMED
THE OPENING NUMBER
OF ALL THE IMPLAUSIBLE THINGS
I WONDER IF ANY BBC DRAMA PRODUCERS WERE WATCHING
DEIDRE AND MIKE BALDWIN
FOUR WEEKS LATER
I THINK THEY COULD
I'M QUIETER NOW
SO I THINK I'LL JUST ABOUT GET THERE FOR LAST ORDERS
A MAN WHO SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ON OUR SCREENS SINCE TELEVISION WAS INVENTED
WE TRIED TO BOOK ALL OF THEM BUT SOMEHOW ENDED UP WITH BRUCE FORSYTH
DON'T YOU THINK
TIME FOR ME TO GO AND DREAM OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
AN INSPECTOR CAME ROUND
SHE COULD BE A PLAYMATE FOR JESSICA
WELL I HAVEN'T THOUGHT YET BUT
I WAS GIFTED WITH A WONDERFUL THING AT THE END OF MY ARMS
IF SHE WAS ALIVE TODAY
BUT I HAD TO PUT IT ASIDE
THIS IS RIDICULOUS
I'M JUST ABOUT TO EXAMINE THEM NOW
KEEP YOUR CARROTS AND ALL THAT YOU'VE AMASSED
THE FIRST CATHEDRAL IN THE COUNTRY TO BE BUILT AND DESIGNED IN THE NEW GOTHIC STYLE
AND IT'S LOSING OUR HERITAGE AS WELL
THE OPENING OF THE SEVEN BRIDGE HELPED THIS ZOO BREACH THE ONE MILLION VISITOR MARK FOR THE VERY
IT COULD HAVE COME FROM THE FAR EAST
I WOULD NOT LIKE TO MEET THE GUY WHO'S WEARING THESE IN A DARK ALLEY AT NIGHT
I DID WEAR THEM
ISN' IT IT IS EXTREMELY HARD TO PUT A PRICE ON SOMETHING
THIS REALLY IS TELEVISION'S TOUGHEST QUIZ
NO TEAM MEMBERS TO CHIP IN
AND YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON TWITTER
THANKS FOR WATCHING
AND PERHAPS NOT MANY AMATEUR GROWERS HAVE HAD THEM IN THEIR GARDENS OVER THE LAST TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS
WE WENT TO SOUTH WALES TO MEET A CHAMPION AMONGST THEM
I CAN'T SHOW THAT ONE
NOT ALL THE SAME BROKE
THE COLOUR WILL BE GOOD
AND STRONG AND INTENSE FOR THE VARIETY
THEY CAN BE USED TO MAXIMUM POTENTIAL
IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE LOTS OF CUTTING TO DO
OR AS MANY OF YOU AS POSSIBLE
TO TRY THEM WITH ME
AND WE CAN COMPARE NOTES AND SEE HOW WE GET ON
NOT JUST IN THE WAY THEY GROW
SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GREENHOUSE OR A HEATED MAT
WITH A RADIATOR UNDERNEATH IT
THAT'S IT FOR THIS WEEK BUT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THE PICTURES YOU'VE SENT OF YOUR GARDENS
I HAVE DEVELOPED SOME SKILL AT DUPLICATING THE ORIGINAL HAND
MY HUSBAND IS ALIVE
IT WILL BE MY WORD AGAINST YOURS
I MANAGED TO ACHIEVE COMPLETE BLADDER CONTROL LAST NIGHT
I'M REALLY SORRY IF I SOUNDED NEGATIVE
I'VE JUST BEEN OVER THERE TRYING THAT
I DON'T WANT TO WORK AT THAT SHOP FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
IT'S AGAINST MY RELIGION
I'M A GOOD MUSLIM
WIPE MY BACKSIDE TWICE A DAY
AND AFTER A NIGHT SHIFT IN HERE
A LITTLE BIT OF PEACE WOULD BE LOVELY
WHEN YOU SEE ME
I COULD SOON BE CARRYING SOMEONE'S BLOOD
SIR I JUST DON'T LIKE THAT MAN
IT TAKES ONE TO TELL ONE
I CAN'T SEND DOBSON
WE DON'T WANT ANY JEALOUSY
IT WAS ALREADY VERY WOBBLY
COULD YOU ASK THEM TO CONTACT ME
YOU DON'T KNOW ME
BUT I'M MR SPENCER
MR WIDOW OF WIDOW
YOU WERE CAUGHT WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHS
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST COOPATE
WE KNOW THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED
WHAT WITH TRYING TO FIND WORK AND HIS FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES
AND WHEN HE'S NOT WORKING
I SPENT HOURS MAKING HIM
HAVE I ALWAYS TOLD YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT MYSELF
AND HAS IT EVER BEEN UNBELIEVABLE
A LITTLE UNCERTAIN ABOUT MY TRUE CHARACTER
WHEN HIS MOTHER DIED
I ARRIVED ON THE FIFTH
IT IS A COLD MORNING
IT'S NOT THE MAN
THAT REMINDS ME
BUT I COULD LISTEN ALL NIGHT TO THEM ADVENTURES
I CAN'T AFFORD TO UPSET HIM
HE SAYS SCANDAL WISE
AND IT CAUSES THE MUSCLES TO GET WEAKER AND WEAKER OVER TIME
BUT WHEN YOU ARE DIAGNOSED WITH MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY
BUT WHEN YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE AFFECTED
BUT ALSO TO CONTINUE THE VITAL RESEARCH THAT COULD END THE SUFFERING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
IN MY HEAD THERE SORT OF LOTS OF RED BRICK
WE SET THE ARTISTS AN OPEN BRIEF SO THAT WE COULD GET TO KNOW THEM
AND ENOUGH AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO
SEE WHAT IS ACTUALLY THERE
AND IN HER SECOND ATTEMPT
MAKING A REALLY EXCITING PAINTING
I'VE ENJOYED DOING IT
I'M QUITE NERVOUS ABOUT IT
THE METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL
WHAT WE MIGHT SEE AND
I'VE SEEN THEM SOMEWHERE
WHERE DO I KNOW THEM FROM
IS A MAJOR THING
IN A WAY TO DEVELOP THE BUSINESS
I WORK IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS DRESSING UP AS A ROMAN SOLDIER AND AN EGYPTIAN EMBALMER
TO BE EXACT AS TO WHEN SUCH A RING WAS MADE
I WAS JUST CURIOUS ABOUT IT
OUR DAY IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE AND IT'S TIME FOR THE CATHEDRAL DOORS TO CLOSE TOO
FROM THE WHOLE ROHOW TEAM
WE'D HAD CHALLENGES BEFORE THAT
BUT I HAD HEARD A VOICE THAT NIGHT
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I THOUGHT I COULD DO ANYTHING
AND IF I WERE ASKED THAT AGAIN MY ANSWER WOULD PROBABLY BE SOMETHING LIKE
THAT YOU HEAR OVER THE ANNOUNCEMENTS
I DO STILL HEAR SOME VOICES
I SEE THINGS IN THE AIR
HE WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT HE WOULDN'T IF IT WAS A BAD IDEA
MY LIFE IS RICH
THAN THE REST OF US
AND I'VE SAID TO THE DOCTORS
LOOKING IN THE MIRROR AT MYSELF
DO YOU REMEMBER
ISN'T THAT RIGHT
OR A TRILOGY OF BOOKS
FUN FOR ALL THE FAMILY
EXCEPT THE WOMEN
LET'S FOCUS ON THE REAL TRAGEDY OF TODAY
INTO THE RECOVERY WARD
CONDESCENDING SHADOW OVER ME
IF YOU WANT TO WIN THE GOBLET OF ULTIMATE KNOWLEDGE
YOU WIN IT FAIR AND SQUARE
LIKE MY LEG'S GOING TO GROW BACK
AND THAT'S AFTER MY REGULAR GP SHIFT
THAT IS EXACTLY WHY YOU SHOULD APPLY FOR THIS JOB
I'M A RECRUITMENT ACCOUNT MANAGER FROM ROMFORD
I'M A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER FROM WINDSOR AND IN MY SPARE TIME I TEACH JUDO
WELL I WAS VERY GOOD AS A JUNIOR AND THEN I STOPPED FOR A WHILE TO COACH
IT'S MY WEDDING ANNIVERSARY TOMORROW
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL
A BUNCH OF DODDERY OLD FOOLS OBSESSED WITH BEATING THE GERMANS
NOT THE HEADS OF THE ENGLISH FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION
IT'S THE HOME GUARD HEROES FROM WALMINGTON ON SEA
THE CAST OF DAD'S ARMY
IN THE SHAPE OF CLIVE DUMB
WE'RE FOCUSING ON BIG NAMES FROM THE SMALL SCREEN
ALMOST AS MUCH AS MYSELF
I DON'T WANT TO GO IN ANOTHER SHOW I'M NOT VERY GOOD IN
THAT WAS BAD NEWS FOR ME AND MY MATE
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T LIKE CAMELS
SO WE'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT TO INCLUDE TV'S GREATEST TIME TRAVELLER
BUT I'VE BEEN WATCHING IT MAN AND BOY
IT'S NOT KNOWN TO THE MAN IN THE STREET
ARE YOU THE DOCTOR
THE EFFECTS AREN'T ALL THAT GOOD
IT'S IT'S THE FACT THAT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY ENGLISH
THE STAR OF THE STAR TREK SERIES AND FILMS BEAMED DOWN TO THE WOGAN STUDIO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
YOU HAVE TWO PROBLEMS
IT'S EASIER WHEN YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING THE CHARACTER FOR MANY YEARS AND YOU KNOW WHO THIS CHARACTER IS
SO IF I HAD TO BE TO WORK AT SEVEN O'CLOCK AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE PICTURE
I HAD TO REPORT TO WORK AT FIVE O'CLOCK TO START GETTING THE MAKE UP ON
GET OUT OF THE MAKE UP CHAIR AT SEVEN AND BECOME A DIRECTOR
THERE WAS A SENSE THAT WE COULD NOT HAVE FUN
AND IT WASN'T A HECK A LOT OF FUN
NOT BECAUSE IT'S THE FINAL FILM
I THINK IT'S A LOT OF FUN
AND I'M STILL PLAYING SPOCK
AS A MATTER OF FACT
MID EARLY SEVENTY S
I WROTE THIS BOOK
AND DURING THE COURSE OF WRITING IT
SO SHE SHE WAS RIGHT AND SHE WAS WRONG
SHE WAS JUMPING IN THE LANGUAGE
BUT HE COULDN'T MAKE THAT LEAP AND HE COULDN'T MAKE THE CONNECTION
THE REALITY BETWEEN WHO I AM AND WHO THIS CHARACTER IS THAT I PLAY
EXCITING SO I SAID TO THE PUBLISHER
LIVE LONG AND PROSPER
THAT WAS SPOCK'S CATCHPHRASE
WELL OVER TWENTY YEARS SINCE YOU FIRST HELD THE NATION IN THRALL OF A SATURDAY MORNING
NOT JUST ANY PUPPET
AND WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF THE CHARACTERS
WHICH IS NICE AND REASSURING TO KNOW AND
I'M REALLY NOT SURE
WHO ARE ALWAYS THERE FOR ME
IT'S GREAT BEING ON THESE SHOWS AND TRAVELLING AROUND THE WORLD
I'M BEGINNING TO SEE THAT NOW
IF ONLY SHE'D LISTENED TO ME
WHEN SHE CAME ON THE SHOW
BUT SHE HAD OTHER AMBITIONS
A POP CAREER CAN BE VERY SHORT LIVED
PROOF THAT IT'S A HARD LIFE BEING A CHATO HOST
A LOT OF FUN IN THE EDMONDSON HOUSEHOLD
WHO MAKES THE JOKES
WE'RE GOING OUT ON A BIG BANG
BUT I'LL BE BACK WITH MORE NEXT TIME
PLAYING ON THE SAND
HOPEFULLY FULL OF TREASURE
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS EXCITING
VO IF YOU'RE HAPPY
TOTALLY INSPIRES ME
CAN WE CARRY ON FOR A BIT MORE BUT
IT RUNS FOR ABOUT SEVEN MILES
FROM THIS STATION
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK
HE WON'T BE ON TIME
SO POPPY'S WRITTEN ALL THAT RUBBISH
I'M SURE YOU'LL ALL DO IT TERRIBLY WELL
HE WAS HELPING AN OLD MAN REGAIN HIS SELF RESPECT
GLADY THE ART OF LEADERSHIP IS DELEGATION
THAT MUST BE SAMMY
I FEEL A BIT SORRY FOR HIM
MAYBE IT'S ONE OF THOSE
WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOT A PLOT
WONDERING IF YOU'VE GOT ANY IDEAS
EVERY WEEK HE IS FAT
I'D NEVER REVEAL YOUR SECRETS
THEN WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
WE SHOULD GET RID OF IT
IT'S JUST A HANGOVER FROM AN OLD PLOT WE'VE REPLACED WITH
LOOKS LIKE A PROVEFI
I INVENTED THE HOVERCRAFT
I'M SORRY WE'RE NOT DOING THAT STORY BUT IF YOU'D LIKE TO HANG AROUND IN THE BISTRO DOWNSTAIRS WITH
AND IF THAT MAN PUTS THAT DYNAMITE INTO THAT OTHER MAN'S TROUSERS
IF YOU DON'T GET RID OF THAT HEALTH INSPECTOR
AND INSPIRED THOUSANDS OF COLLECTORS ALONG THE WAY
IN THIS SERIES WE WANT TO SHARE THAT INSIDE KNOWLEDGE WITH YOU
AND WHAT SHOULD YOU LOOK FOR WHEN YOU GO OUT BUYING
I'M HAVING THIS
I THINK THOMAS PLANT WAS WITH ME
THAT QUALITY WILL OUT
AND THEN WHEN THE NAME ROLEX IS REVEALED
THEY WERE REALLY OVERSIZED FOR YOUR CUFF
AND YET WE ARE VERY USED TO LOOKING AT THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
ANYTHING RETRO OR VINTAGE
BUT MY ADVICE IS TO GO FOR THE BIG NAMES
EIGHTEEN CARAT OR HIGHER
AND SOMEONE TO DO THE WORK
AND THEY WERE JUST VERY SMALL CHIPS
IT'S GONE OUT OF FASHION
WHO WOULD WEAR A RUBY NECKLACE IN A SUPERMARKET
BUT HOW CAN YOU TELL YOUR DIAMONDS FROM A BIT OF PASTE
AND THE THINGS YOUR GRANNY WOULDN'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT
YOU MAY NOT WANT TO WEAR TODAY
SO IF YOU WANT TO SELL YOUR JEWELLERY OR IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT
THERE ARE SOME VERY CLEVER BUT SIMPLE WAYS OF MAKING IT LOOK BETTER
AS CHRISTINA HAS BEEN FINDING OUT
AND I WOULD LIKE TO COLLECT FIRST EDITIONS
LESS THAN A COUPLE OF MINUTES LEFT
WAS PRESENTED BY KING CHARLES THE FIRST TO HIS CHUM
ON THE STRENGTH OF THAT
BECAUSE LAST TIME
CUTS THE MUSTARD
NOW WE MOVE TO THE THESPIAN
WE DON'T WANT YOU TO
BUT WITH THE PRIVATE WORK
WHAT TIME DID YOU PUT HIM DOWN
I'M FROM FEATHERSON IN WEST YORKSHIRE
I'M A MEDICAL SECRETARY FROM BRADFORD
AND I LOVE TRAVELLING
I'LL TRY THAT ONE
I THINK WE PLAYED THE HARDEST ONE
AND OUR PET RABBIT AS WELL
I WISH I HAD MORE BRAINS
YOU'VE GOT A BAPTIST CHURCH
IF ONLY I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HIS HEAD
I WAS MARRIED TO A MR HARMON O
A LADY WITH ONE OF THE SHARPEST TONGUES IN HOLLYWOOD AND ONE OF THE CINEMA'S FINEST ACTRESSES
WHEN BET DAVIS CAME ON THE SHOW BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
SHE WAS THERE FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY TO PUBLICISE HER BOOK AND WOE
I TRY TO TEACH MY CHILDREN THAT
THAT'S ENOUGH ABOUT ME
WHAT ABOUT MY BOOK
BECAUSE I CAN PLAY THIS REALLY TOUGH
MEAN SHE'S NOT A PERSON I WOULD LIKE TO BE BUT SHE HAS CERTAIN QUALITIES THAT I THAT I APPRECIATE AND THAT I
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT
YOU WANT ME TO GRIND THIS CIGARETTE OUT INTO IT
OR IF YOU'RE AMERICAN
I WAS SITTING THERE AND AFTER ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION
THE HOST SAID TO ME
I NEVER HAD REALLY A PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE I MEAN I THINK PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ANYWHERE
I AGREE WITH THAT
WHEN I WENT TO AMERICA AND I GOT INTO ACTING
YOU HAVE A STRANGE BODY
THIS NEW FILM YOU'VE MADE
THERE'S ACTION AND ADVENTURE AND THERE'S OTHER COMIC RELIEF AGAIN AND COMMANDO
BECAUSE OF THE COMBINATION
HAS DONE SO WELL AND HAS GONE THROUGH THE ROOF BOX OFFICE WISE OVERSEAS
COMPARED TO TO RAMBO BECAUSE IT CAME OUT ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME
MY FIGHTS IN THICK PLACE IN LOS ANGELES
I LET PEOPLE DECIDE FOR THAT
I DON'T THINK THAT HE EVER WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THE BODY BUILDINGIL COMPETITION BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HE'S
HE MADE OUT THAT HE WAS QUITE THE STUNTMAN
WAS THE CROWN SOLICITOR OF BERMUDA
AND A MATTER OF FACT
HOW ABOUT HIM FLING
CLEARLY ENJOYING HIS LIFE AND HIS WORK
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FOR TWO HOURS
AND THEN HE TOOK ANOTHER JOB AND WENT OFF TO TUNISIA AND LATER ON
I HAD TO GO TO THE GYM AND DO ALL THE WORK
THEY COULDN'T HEAR ME AND I SUDDENLY THOUGHT
EUROPE'S A BIG PLACE
I'LL GIVE IT A TRY
THE PRESS WAS WAITING IN GLASGOW AND THEY'D HAD THE TV CREWS OUT AND THEY HAD THE MAGAZINES AND
MAYBE FLYING IS MACHO
AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S NICE ABOUT FLYING
IS IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER
FLYING IS ABOUT FAMILIES
IT'S ABOUT BOYFRIENDS AND GIRLFRIENDS
IN WHICH I FLY A NINETEEN TWENTY SIX STERMAN
IT FLIES THROUGH THE TREES
I DID EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT BIT
THEY TAKE MY MIND OFF PRODUCING
YOU GREW UP AMONG THE RICH AND THE FAMOUS
THE MORE DANGEROUS STUNTS
I REMEMBER ON MY
I LEAVE FOR THE STUNTMEN BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN TRICKS THAT YOU KNOW
I THINK EVERYBODY'S GOT PROBLEMS
I'M STILL LOOKING
MY NAME IS BOND
AND THEN BUT I WOULD HEAR IT IN MY MIND MY NAME
UM MR BOND BAR MARTINI
WHO DEADPANNED HIS WAY THROUGH THE NAKED GUN FILMS PLAYING A TOUGH GUY COP WITH AS MUCH SENSE
THAT WAS SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND LIKE ANY GOOD SECRET AGENT
AND THE PRINCE OF WALES
WHENEVER I'VE SEEN YOU INTERVIEWED
IF I'D STAYED WHERE I WAS
DO YOU STILL HAVE THE CAT
SHE SHOULD HAVE SOBERED UP BY NOW
ONLY I SAW HIM IN THE HIGH STREET LAST WEEK A COUPLE OF TIMES
SHE DIDN'T REALLY
BUT WE WANT TO FORGET THAT
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL THAT JUST BECAUSE WE GOT YOU SOMETHING
AS MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
I TRIED TO CALL HIM THIS MORNING
TELL HIM WHAT'S HAPPENED
SEEN MY COLLEAGUE YOU SEEN ME
IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF TIME
IT WOULD SAVE A BIT OF TIME
I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TIME
I'VE JUST FLOWN THIRTEEN
WE WOULDN'T HAVE A SHOW
IF YOU'RE A LADY
TO HAVE YOUR NECKLACES ON IT JUST DRAPED
MAYBE HALF A DOZEN IN THE BEDROOM
HOW ABOUT DOUBLE YOUR MONEY
BECAUSE LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
WAS IT WORTH THE WAIT
HE PRODUCED A WEALTH OF NOVELS
THE MOST CELEBRATED AND LOVED OF ALL
GIBBON DISAGREED WITH THE TRADITIONAL ROLE OF THE WOMEN
HE DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE INFERIOR
THAT WASN'T TOO BAD
IT WAS HOME TO THE BURNETT FAMILY FOR A STAGGERING FOURTEEN GENERATIONS
THE FAMILY MOVED THERE AND STAYED THERE FOR THE NEXT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS
WHERE THEIR NAME CHANGED FROM BERNARD TO BURNETT
ROBERT THE BRUCE WOULD COME TO VISIT HERE AND RECUPERATE FROM THE RIGORS OF BATTLE
HE LOVED IT SO MUCH SO THAT HE MADE THIS AREA PART OF THE ROYAL FOREST
AND I MUST SAY I HOPE MY LITTLE VISIT TODAY HAS INSPIRED YOU TO TAKE A LOOK FOR YOURSELF
WOULD YOU READ IT
WE NEED SIX PAIRS OF AIR AND AIR YELLOW COURTS SO YOU'LL HAVE TO SLING IN THE COMIC
SO TELL THAT POTTY CHAEY MAID THAT SHE IS NOW MISSALLYKILL OF
WE LIKE CHALK AND CHEESE
YOU SORT OF PEOPLE ARE SO CASUAL
I CAN WALK STRAIGHT INTO THE FOREIGN OFFICE
YOUR PEOPLE MADE ME PAID FIVE BOB AND GAVE ME THIS BADGE
SOUVENIRS HE'S EVEN HAD TO START BINGO IN THE GREAT HALL
HE'S NOT UP TO IT
YOU'VE GOT TO BUCKLE DOWN
WHY DON'T YOU BRING HER DOWN AND SEE HOW THEY GET ON IF IT LOOKS LIKE A
I REALLY ENJOYED THAT
WANTED TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH AN ORDINARY COMMON PERSON
I READ ABOUT THAT
I'M BOUND TO MEET HIM
IS A BONFIRE IN THE MESS
DEN ONCE TOLD ME HE'D MADE A MESS OF EVERY RELATIONSHIP HE'D EVER HAD
THAT'S WHAT A REPORT BY MPS HAS FOUND
ALL ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PASSENGERS ON THE FLIGHT FROM BARCELONA TO DUSELDORF HAVE BEEN KILLED
THE CAUSE ISN'T YET KNOWN
OFFICIALS SAY IT COULD TAKE DAYS TO RECOVER THE BODIES
WHAT AM I DOING HERE
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
THERE MAY BE A FAR MORE INNOCENT EXPLANATION
HOW DID YOU GET SPLIT UP
IF WE WAIT ANY LONGER
AND IN THE MEANTIME
I KNOW YOUR FACE BACKWARDS AND INSIDE OUT
YOUR BEST CHANCE TO LOOK ANYWHERE NEAR NORMAL LIES WITH ME
AND YOU'RE FUSSING OVER GEOGRAPHY
AND IT'S A PASSION THAT'S REFLECTED AT OUR VALUATION DAYS
THE METAL SOLD FOR MORE THAN THEIR SCRAP VALUE
IF THEY BELONGED TO A FAMOUS FOOTBALLER
WITH THE INSIDE TRACK
AND YOUR LOCAL MINISTER SAYS NO
I KNEW IT WASN'T GOING TO MAKE FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS
WHAT A HORRIBLE WORD
UM TEND TO BE REASONABLY WELL OFF AND THEY'LL YOU KNOW THEY'LL SPEND MONEY ON THEIR HOBBY AND
THINK IS WHERE THE POTENTIAL LIES
I THOUGHT I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD DO A BIT BETTER
AND THERE WAS A SORT OF PALPABLE SENSE OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT ABOUT THE ALBUM
HE'D STARTED OFF AS AN AMATEUR
PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE
UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE
IT WAS A HORSE MEASURING CANE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I'M A MEMBER OF THE LORD'S TAVERNERS
TURN OUT AND PLAY THE ODD GAME OF CRICKET
OF WHICH I HAVE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY
THE RELEVANCE OF THIS PARTICULAR WISDOM
YOU PROBABLY HAVE
A COLLECTOR MAY WANT IT
THREE STUDENTS WERE OVERCOME BY FUMES
AND KNOWING THAT I'VE GIVEN MY BEST FOR THE TEAM
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ARE YOUR MAIN STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES MURY
IN LIFE THERE'S OFTEN A THIN LINE BETWEEN GLORIOUS SUCCESS AND TOTAL FAILURE AND HERE THAT LINE IS
I USED TO BE IN THE NAVY
I'M FROM CHESTER
THAT'S MIDDLE OF THE ROAD
WAS STUDYING MY COURSE
SO IT JUST KIND OF ALL STEMMED FROM THERE REALLY
IT WAS MAINLY JUST ME WANTING TO SEE A BAND
YOU'RE FEELING SAD AND YOU'RE THINKING NEGATIVE THOUGHTS
BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN SUCH A LOW SCORE THEN
AND MAYBE WE'LL DO IT IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY WHERE IT'S A BIT MORE EXOTIC
WE'LL BE BACK NEXT TIME WITH MORE NEW CONTESTANTS PUSHING THEMSELVES TO THE EDGE
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL
AND AMONGST THE FAMOUS PEOPLE WHO VISITED THAT YEAR
BECAUSE HE'S GOING UNDER THE HAMMER
BECAUSE HE WAS BROUGHT UP HERE
SO HE WAS A LITTLE BOY
THE VISITORS WHO COME
BECAUSE WHAT THEY COME FOR MOSTLY IS THE FURNITURE
THE MORE YOU LOOK AT THE PIECES
THE MORE YOU KEEP LEARNING
THIS IS WHAT'S SO WONDERFUL
BECAUSE AFTER FORTY YEARS
EVERY SINGLE DAY SOMEBODY I SHOW ROUND THE HOUSE WILL TELL ME SOMETHING
IS COMPRISED OF FOUR INGREDIENTS
IT ISN'T BUT A LOT OF THE TRADITIONAL INGREDIENTS AND RECIPES FROM THE AREA WERE BASED ON
MADE IN ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES
AND USING LOCALLY SOURCED FOOD THAT'S AFFORDABLE
THAT'S MADE YOU FEEL RATHER HUNGRY
WHAT ARE YOU EATING TONIGHT
YOU CAN ALWAYS LEARN SOMETHING
JOIN US AGAIN NEXT TIME FOR MANY MORE SURPRISES
STRAIGHT TO THE POINT
STRAIGHT TO THE POINT
I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN
THERES PLENTY OF SANE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SLEEP WITH YOU
I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE VERY CAREFUL
IT WOULD BE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MATTER
OUR JOBS ARE AT STAKE
ALL OUR JOBS ARE AT STAKE
SO THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF COMPETING PRESSURES
DON'T BE SO EMOTIONAL
WE WANTED TO MAKE THE CASE THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE WOMEN INVOLVED IN SOME WAY IN TRYING TO MAKE
DID YOU FORCE ANYONE TO HAVE SEX
I'M LOOKING FOR JUSTICE
I'LL MAKE IT VERY SIMPLE FOR YOU
HOUSE STRIP NAKED
AND SO BY THE TIME I TOOK OUT MY HAIR TIE
BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE CAN READ
WHEN PEOPLE ARE EDUCATED
DON'T TEACH THEM TO READ
AS A DESCENDANT OF SLAVES
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COULD GIVE US ANOTHER STADIUM AND THEN WE COULD PLAY SOCCER IN THAT AND
THEIR ACCESS TO RESOURCES
THEIR NETWORK AND CONNECTIONS ARE VERY WEAK
AH QUESTIONING YOUR AUTHORITY
NOBODY HAD GOTTEN VERY FAR
AND HAVING THE AUDACITY TO BE A WOMAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THAT I THOUGHT I WAS TRYING TO
I WAS THE FIRST WOMAN TO WIN ANY PRIMARY AND THEN WENT ON TO WIN A NUMBER OF THEM AND
WE WERE RAISING TRAFFICKING
WE WERE PUSHING FOR
AH LAWS IN COUNTRIES TO PUNISH TRAFFICKERS
LACK OF HEALTH CARE
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION
A WOMAN WAS BASICALLY TOLD
AS THEY CONTINUED TO GROPE MY BODY EVERYWHERE
WE HAD MOHAMED MORSI'S WOMEN'S AFFAIRS ADVISOR
AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED
SO WE WILL NOT WAIT
ANY REVOLUTION THEY TRY TO SELL US WILL FAIL
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY
MY QUESTION TO THEM IS
WITH GROUPS LIKE
THEY MAKE A POINT OF TRYING TO CONTROL AND SUBJUGATE WOMEN AS A
USE IT IN SUPPORT OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS BECAUSE
NOT ALL OF THEM DO
IF WE CAN GET THIS KIND OF PERFECT STORM OF WOMEN ON THE GROUND FIGHTING FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND
DOMESTIC OBJECTS BECAUSE THEY ALL TELL A STORY
THEY MAY NEED MORE WORK IN THE RESEARCH AND BE LESS WELL DOCUMENTED THAN THE ITEMS OF THE GRAND AND
THE MORE THE THE FARMHOUSE TYPE KITCHEN TABLE
SO WHEN THIS LADY CAME ALONG WITH THIS SPICE TOWER WHICH WAS OOZING CHARM
THE LABELS WERE INTACT AND
IT WASN'T SPLIT IT'S
AND MID TO LATE VICTORIAN TIMES
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HE WAS QUITE AH AN ALCHEMIST AND INTERESTED IN THE CHEMISTRY BEHIND POTTING
AND SO HE AND HIS TEAM PATENTED QUITE A LOT OF NEW FORMS OF
I REALLY REALLY ENJOYED THOSE
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT THIS JOB
AND THE DRINK LABELS
THEY TELL A SOCIAL HISTORY
HE WANTED EIGHT
BECAUSE THOSE AREN'T OBVIOUSLY VALUABLE THINGS
GRABBED HIS OPPORTUNITY
PICTURE THE SCENE
BRING OUT THE MO OF ROTHSCHILD
BUT YOU KNOW HE'S GOT TO IDENTIFY IT
THEY DON'T HAVE THINGS LIKE THAT
BEAUTIFULLY MADE THINGS
GREAT NAMES AND SUPERB ANTIQUES
WE WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT MAKES THEM SPECIAL
PHONE GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS I CAN
HE'S ACTUALLY DOWNSIZING
FRESH TO MARKET
JUST THE WAY THE MARKET LIKES THEM
SAY TO YOURSELF WHAT YOU'RE PREPARED TO PAY FOR SOMETHING
AH GO MAYBE ONE BID MORE
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT FOR A SINGLE BID
IF YOU'VE GOT YOUR LIMIT
WELCOME TO OUR FIRST GENERAL SALE OF THE NEW YEAR
IS THE INTERACTION WITH CLIENTS AND THE PUBLIC
THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING TO OUR SALES THEY WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED
EVERYBODY LOVES THE GRAND
BUT DON'T OVERLOOK THE SEEMINGLY ORDINARY
IT COULD BE WORTH A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN YOU'D EXPECT IN TODAY'S MARKET
A CENTRE FOR EDUCATION
ANYTHING I COULD GET MY HANDS ON
IN THE IDEAL WORLD
I FEEL LIKE THE COMEBACK KID YOU KNOW
THAT IS PLUS FORTY
PUTTING A TRAPPED SECURITY GUARD OUT OF A GAS FILLED BUILDING IS QUITE HEROIC
THERE'S OFTEN A THIN LINE BETWEEN GLORIOUS SUCCESS AND TOTAL FAILURE AND HERE
I PLAY INDOOR BALLS IN LOCAL LEAGUES
I'M A HOSPITALITY TUTOR AND NOT A LOT TENDS TO FAZE ME
JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT FASTER THAN IT WAS
AS FA AS I CAN BE
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL
WHY DON WE PUT SEVEN TO NINE
THEY'VE TRANSFORMED THIS ROOM
IT'S A GREAT VASE
WE'VE SEEN SOME WONDERFUL WORKS OF ART PASSING THROUGH OUR VALUATION DOORS AND MANY OF THEM HAVE SOLD FOR HUGE
WHAT KIND OF ART WILL WE SEE COMING THROUGH THE VALUATION DOORS
I LOOK AT THE SEPARATION BETWEEN ART AND LIFE AND I DO PERFORMANCE ART
LET'S START WITH THIS
IF IF WE WERE HERE BIDDING AND
THIS IS THE NEXT BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE
THIS ALREADY HAPPENED IT WAS THE WIFE
WHAT ABOUT POOR YVONNE
AND WHAT DID HE SAY
I'M DOWN ABOUT TWELVE GRID
I THINK I MIGHT
SHE PUSHED YOU OVER
MOST OF EROL INCIDAL'S TRIAL WAS HELD IN SECRET
THEY BELIEVE ANDREAS LUBITZ LOCKED THE PILOT OUT OF THE COCKPIT AND FLEW INTO MOUNTAINS
IN THE FINAL MOMENTS
SCREAMS FROM PASSENGERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE VOICE RECORDER
CONTINUE THE JOURNEY WITHOUT DELAY AND HAVE THE GUARDS FIND THE POOR GENTLEMAN FIRST THING TOMORROW
BUT BECAUSE IT'S MORE CONVENIENT FOR EVERYBODY ELSE
AT THE ARDINGLY INTERNATIONAL ANTIQUES AND COLLECTORS FAIR
YOU'RE THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY THERE
IT COULD BE TASTY
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
THERE AND ONE DODGY ONE THERE
I NEVER REMEMBER HER COMPLAINING ABOUT ANYTHING
FINDING THREE MONTH OLD CURRIES UNDER THE BED
HE WAS ONLY WITH HER FOR ONE DAY
AND I PLAY IN A LOCAL SKITTLES TEAM
THE NOT TOO DANGEROUS
YOU GET FIRST CHOICE OF LANE
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
STAY TUNED AND YOU'LL FIND OUT
THE OTHER END OF THE SCALE IS THAT JUST A PLAIN ME SHOULD WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CARVING THIRTY
AND WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT GOOD DESIGN AND BAD DESIGN
BUT WHAT IS GOOD DESIGN
COME ALONG TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS
NORTH OF THE RIVER THAMES
AND AS PART OF THE FESTIVITIES AND ESSENTIAL MAINTENANCE
IT'S HAD A THOROUGH CLEANUP INSIDE AND OUTSIDE
NOW THAT IS A STAGGERING AMOUNT OF MONEY BACK THEN
SO NOW WE CAN APPRECIATE THE ORIGINAL VISION OF THE CATHEDRAL'S ARCHITECT
SO IF IT TOOK SEVEN YEARS TO GET THE PLANS APPROVED
AND I KNOW IT WORKS
WHAT WE'VE GOT ARE
JOIN US AGAIN SOON FOR MANY MORE
SO ALL THAT BIGLES
WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA
AND IF THINGS DON'T WORK OUT FOR YOU
SORRY I EXPECT YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW ALL ABOUT ME
I WAS FORMALLY INTERVIEWED AT ED OFFICE IN LONDON
I MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE
NOT GOT ENOUGH WORK
I KNOW THAT CAN'T HAPPEN
YOUR SON WANTS ME
IT COMES DOWN TO THIS
TONIGHT'S FINALISTS HAVE SEEN OFF THE OTHER NINETY CONTENDERS
BUT TO CLAIM THE BIG PRIZE
SHE TALKED HER WAY INTO THE FORTRESS
YOU HAVE MY CHILDREN
WHAT COULD HAPPEN
TURNED BACK AT THE PEOPLE WITH HER CHILDREN
LIFTED UP HER SKIRT AND SAID
AND I'VE GOT EVERYTHING I NEED TO MAKE MORE
ENGLAND VERSUS AUSTRALIA
AND IF THEY'RE TIED ON PASSES AS WELL
THERE WILL HAVE TO BE A TIE BREAK
WE HAVEN'T HAD ONE OF THOSE YET IN A GRAND FINAL
TWO MORE FINALISTS TO GO
EACH OF THEM HAVING ALREADY SCORED FIFTEEN POINTS
WITH OR WITHOUT A STRATEGY
YOU JUST BECOME A MEMORY
SHE PUSHED YOU OVER
I MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE
CLOSE COME OUT
NOT GOT ENOUGH WORK
YOUR SON WANTS ME
AND YOU KNOW WHY IT'S THAT SIZE
WHO IS THE TIME
IT MEANS MORE ROADS
I THINK THERE'S TOO MANY OF US AROUND AND WE'RE SPOOKING THEM
IT'S REALLY PUT A SMILE ON MY FACE BEING SO CLOSE TO NATURE AND IT JUST MAKES YOU REALIZE HOW
IT'S OK FOR YOU AT HOME YOU CAN SIT BACK
HAVE A CUP OF TEA AND PUT YOUR FEET UP AND ENJOY THE ACTION
IT'S A ROLLER COASTER RIDE
THERE IS NO RESERVE
THEN IT COULDN'T BE MORE RIGHT
IT PACKS A REAL PUNCH AND ACCORDING TO THE LOCALS
IT'S THE BEST KEPT SECRET IN SOMERSET
SO COME WITH ME AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHY
THE CATHEDRAL CHOIR
COULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER
SO IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM IN LINE
REALLY BECKONS YOU IN
AND I'VE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED MY TIME HERE AND I HOPE IT'S INSPIRED YOU TO COME AND LOOK FOR YOURSELF
WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE MARVELLOUS BUILDING WE ARE IN AT THE MOMENT
ONE FIFTY AS AN ESTIMATE
JOIN ME AGAIN SOON FOR MANY MORE SURPRISES
THE AUCTION HAS JUST STOPPED
AND I THINK ALL OUR OWNERS HAVE GONE HOME HAPPY
ESPECIALLY CHERIE WITH THE TWO PORTRAITS OF THE JACK RUSSELLS
THEY SAVES A BUNCH OF FIFTH COLUMNISTS OVER THERE
THAT SOMEONE DIED BECAUSE I OVERSLEPT
WHEN I'M OLD ENOUGH
ONE OF THEM IS CALLED THE MAGIC TOUCH
IS OUT TO WORK AS A TEAM
IT DOESN'T REALLY FAZE ME
CAN THEY KEEP IT TOGETHER
IN THESE SEVEN TRAINEES
BUT I'M A PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHER
I'M NOT SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ACTUALLY
SOMEWHERE THAT WILL HELP YOU
IT MIGHT BE A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY
IT MIGHT BE A FRIEND
LIVERPOOL CATHEDRAL IS THE LARGEST IN THE UK
AND EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY TO TRY RINGING IT
ESPECIALLY WITH HIM
AND THE SLIGHT TILT DOWN
DIA LU JORDAN HAS TAKEN A TRIP DOWN TO CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL TO SEE TWO BRAND NEW ROYAL
THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST AND THE HEAVIEST PEAL OF BELLS IN THE WORLD
AM I GOING TO BE HAVING A GO AT TRYING TO RING THEM LATER ON
AND MAKE YOUR BROKEN PEOPLE WHOLE
OR HOW YOUR CHURCH IS MARKING THE ANNIVERSARY
THROUGHOUT HOLY WEEK
ESPECIALLY THIS IMPASSIONED CHORUS
WHICH WE'RE GOING TO HEAR NOW SUNG FOR US BY THE HUDDERSFIELD CHORAL SOCIETY ACCOMPANIED BY THE BBC
AND WITH THE BELLS RINGING OUT IN PRAISE
AS WE ALL CELEBRATE THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENT IN THE CHRISTIAN CALENDAR
AND THE SENSE OF HOPE THAT CHRIST'S RESURRECTION BRINGS
DAVID GRANT WILL BE THINKING ABOUT THE ENDURING RELIGIOUS SYMBOL OF THE LAMB
AMONGST OTHER THINGS
HE'S GOING TO BE DOWN ON THE FARM WITNESSING THE JOY OF NEW LIFE
SCALE AND MAYBE AN INTERESTING FOCAL POINT FOR YOUR VIEWER TO DISCOVER
I THINK YOU'D SAY THAT HEART CARRIES THE DAY
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT
LIKE ALL GREAT AIRCRAFT
THAT THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE VISIBLE ON THE YACHT
LOOKING INTO THE COCKPIT
SAW THE FOUR AIRCRAFT COMING TOWARDS US
WHEN THE CHAP WAS ABOUT TO OPEN FIRE
BECAUSE I CONSIDER IT TO BE MY AIRCRAFT
THE AEROPLANES WERE TALKING TO EACH OTHER
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
CONTAINERS WERE SNAPPING OFF
IF ANYTHING WENT WRONG
TIME YOU TAKE OFF
AS A FAMILY UNIT
AND WE LIVE SURROUNDED BY WATER
WHERE WOULD YOU BEGIN
WELL I'M GOING TO BE MEETING A COUPLE OF RETIRED TEACHERS
STARTED WITH A BOOK
WHAT DO YOU DO AND HOW DO YOU DO IT
THERE MIGHT NOT BE A RIGHT WAY OF DOING IT
A HUNDRED YEARS' TIME
HAVING SAID THAT
THE BIG ADVANTAGE
THE FIRST TIME THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T FEED THAT PONY
IT WILL PERHAPS KICK THEM
NOT FEEDING THE PONIES
AND THAT INCLUDES PONIES
THEY CAN GET CUT
SKILLS THAT HAVE HELPED HIM MAKE IT TO THE TOP
I'M NOT REACTING
IT'S VERY SPECIAL
CHOPPED UP BY THE TURBINES OR DELAYED FROM GETTING BACK INTO THE RIVER
IN THE LEAST ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS
WE CAN CHOOSE TO BUY BRITISH
ONCE IT GETS TO A CERTAIN POINT
PERHAPS ONE DAY HOME GROWN CLOTHES WILL BE AS EASY TO BUY AS BRITISH V
THIS BLOCK HERE
IT SOUNDS A BIT TWEE
NEXT WEEK WE'RE GOING TO BE IN NORFOLK CELEBRATING EASTER SUNDAY
WHERE I'LL BE LOOKING AT HOW RABBITS ARE PLAYING A BIG PART IN MAINTAINING ONE OF OUR MOST VITAL
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVEN'T GOT ONE
THIS IS A T SHIRT THAT'S SEEN BETTER DAYS
YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY I'M HERE
THEY WERE FINED AND GIVEN A MULTIMILLION POUND FINE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE THEY CONFESSED
FUNDING PARAMILITARY GROUPS HERE THAT WERE TARGETING BANANA FARM WORKERS AND TRADE
SOME ROCK AND ROLL
TELL ME ABOUT THE BIBLE LIKE THAT
LIKE THE BIBLE SAYS
WHEN I WAS FIRST IN HERE
WHICH MEANS I HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS
SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
IF THIS PERSON SAYS NO
IT WAS A SEXUAL ASSAULT
WAS HE SCARED OF BEING OUT OF SCHOOL
THE ROUTINE BEING CHANGED
I WAS WAITING UNTIL I WOULD GET LIKE HUNDRED EIGHTY GIGABYTES
IN THOSE TWO RESPECTS
NOT IN A SENSE OF A DELUSIONARY WAY
I HAD NO FRIENDS WHATSOEVER
I DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE I DID WHAT I DID ON MY OWN
FRANKLY FROM A RENTED POINT OF VIEW
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE TREE
WHY IS THAT SIGNIFICANT
SO THE PROPERTY I'M HERE TO SEE COULD HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS TREE
THREE BASIC REASONS
SOME TAKE TO IT LIKE A DUCK TO WATER AND OTHERS
AND THIS ONE CAME ON
YOU END UP DABBLING IN ALL THE DIFFERENT TRADES
VERY FEW THINGS HOUSE WISE
SO WOULD SELL IT
WE INTEND TO FIX THE HOUSE UP AND RENT IT
THE ONLY THING THAT'S REALLY OF QUESTION IS THE UPSTAIRS BATHROOM
THE ONLY THING I REALLY HAVE GOT IN QUESTION IS TO LOOK ON TO THE DEEDS AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT
IF IT WORKS OUT THAT WAY
BUT I THINK IT GAVE THEM THE PUSH THEY NEEDED TO FINALLY GET INTO PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT
HE'S GOT ALL THE SKILLS AND THE ENTHUSIASM HE NEEDS AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE HIS LEVEL HEADED APPROACH
THOUSAND I'M EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO BUY ALL THE MATERIALS
IT'S A PLOT WITH PLANNING PERMISSION TO BUILD NOT ONE
THAT IS ALL THE GOOD NEWS
IT'S ALSO GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO SECURE THAT FINANCE IN THIS CURRENT CLIMATE
AH WHILST IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE MONEY ON THESE DEVELOPMENTS
SO YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY ACCESS PROBLEMS AND
YOU'VE GOT NO MATURE TREES ON THE SITE
THOUGHT FROM A DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION POINT OF VIEW
NO FLAKING PAINT
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY
THESE PROPERTIES ARE SITUATED RIGHT ON THAT ROAD
SO THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME FORM OF DISCOUNT ON THE PRICE TO REFLECT THE FACT THAT YOU DO
NO CRUMBLING POINTING ETC
AND I WOULD EXPECT THESE TO SELL IN THE ORDER OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND
HE'S EQUIPPED WITH ALL THE KNOWHOW AND RESOURCES
PLUS THE PLANNING IS IN PLACE
THE HARDEST PART OF DAVID'S JOB IS THE RESALE
WILL HE RECOUP ON HIS INVESTMENT
IT REALLY IS A TOUGH MARKET AT THE MOMENT FOR NEW BUILDS
TALKING TO EVERYBODY
SORTING OUT THE BUDGET
WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'VE NOT BEEN HERE AS MUCH AS I WANT TO BE
WE'VE PUT A NEW GAS MAIN IN
BUT I'VE STILL GOT THE GUTTER IN
NOT FINISHED YET
WE BOUGHT IT TO RENT
YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THE SERVICES
ALL THE WALLS ARE FLAT AND THE THE KITCHEN AND BATHROOM ARE OBVIOUSLY WORK IN PROGRESS BUT
POSSIBLY IF THE MARKET STEPS UP A LITTLE BIT
WHEN IT COMES TO OUTSIDE
YOU'VE GOT A NICE VIEW OVER THE GARDEN
IT'S ACTUALLY OWNED BY THE HOUSE TWO DOORS DOWN
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR GUN IS OVER THAT WAY
IT WAS TURNED DOWN
UM BUT ONLY ON HIGHWAYS GROUNDS
YOU COULD IMAGINE IT GOT A LOT OF INTEREST
NOW YOU'RE TALKING SOME SERIOUS PROFIT
WITH MY MOTHER'S SUPPORT
UM IT'S CERTAINLY GOT SOME NICE ASPECTS ABOUT IT
NO PARKING ANYTHING
COME OUT FIND YOUR CARS HAVE BEEN DAMAGED AND SOMETHING'S IMPORTANT TO ME
FROM THE MONEY THAT WE MADE ON THE PROPERTY THAT I LIVED IN WHILE I WAS AT UNIVERSITY
SO WE THINK THE MONEY WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ON THIS PROPERTY
I'VE FUNDED IT SO FAR
WITH THE HELP FROM MUM
THERE IS DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL
WILL IT BE FILLED WITH A NICE NEW CAR WHEN WE RETURN IN A FEW MONTHS
WE'RE DYING TO FIND OUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT WHEN I BOUGHT IT
IT'S NOT A VERY BIG AREA
THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE WE COULD POSITION A THERMAL HEAT PUMP AND IT'S THE SIZE OF A DOUBLE
THIS IS A BATHROOM
FOR RENTAL VALUE
THIS PROPERTY WILL SELL IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
IN THE LONG TERM
IT'S PERHAPS NOT BEEN THE BEST TIME FOR THE HOUSING INDUSTRY
I THINK IT'S A FANTASTIC COTTAGE
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT AND
AND I SAID TO MYSELF
I THINK IT'S DISGUSTING
THAT'S IT'S VERY NICE
AND TODAY'S SPECIAL PRICE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
IT WAS KIND OF AKIN TO POISON IF SOMETHING MADE YOU COLD
AH ROSKOFF'S OLD PORT
IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT THAT THE FIRST FRENCH ONION SELLER DECIDED TO TRY HIS LUCK AND CROSS THE
WE KNOW THAT TODAY YOU HAVE TO GET IT UP TO AT LEAST SEVENTY DEGREES CENTIGRADE
VICTORIANS USED TO LOVE THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SPECIAL
THIS PLACE IS LEASEHOLD
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING
THE BAD THING IN THIS INSTANCE IS THAT THE LEASE IS VERY SHORT
IT'S ONLY FIFTY SIX YEARS
PLACE A MO COMPANY WILL NOT GO FOR A LEASE THAT'S THAT SHORT
YOU CAN NEGOTIATE TO HAVE A LEASE EXTENDED
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
IS THE FACT THAT IT DOES HAVE THAT SHORT LEASE
WE DIDN'T BUY THE
YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED
WHICH I SHOULD IMAGINE BEING BETWEEN TEN
IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY
WILL IT BE AS EASY AS HE MAKES OUT
SO TERRY OBVIOUSLY KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DOING
AND IF YOU'VE GOT ANY DOUBTS THAT NOW'S A GOOD TIME TO INVEST IN PROPERTY
LISTEN TO THE PROFESSIONALS
WHERE CAN YOU GET THAT AT THE MOMENT
CERTAINLY NOT IN THE BANKS
THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE
BUT IN MY OPINION
WORTH THINKING ABOUT
WHAT REALLY SETS THIS GARDEN OFF
IT'S A WINTER VIEW ONLY
PREDOMINANTLY MADE UP OF OLDER STYLE OF PROPERTIES
AND THE GUIDE IS REALISTICALLY SET AT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY
THAT WAS THE CRUNCH
THE YOUNGEST GRANDSON
AND SINCE HE'S RETIRED LAST YEAR
HE'S ALWAYS SAID HE'D LIKE TO DO SOMETHING PROPERTY AND
WHY VERY GOOD AT
PROBABLY LABOURING A LITTLE BIT
AND DOING THE GARDENING
IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY
HE SAID IT WOULD BE TWELVE WEEKS
WE JUST MAKE A PLAN
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY NEED THAT
SO WE STILL CAME IN BUDGET
SLIGHTLY OVER BY
IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC
I'M IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY HE'S ACTUALLY IMPROVED THE PROPERTY
PER CALENDAR MONTH
ONCE THE WORK IS DONE I WOULD EXPECT TO ACHIEVE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY
THIS IS A HOT PROPERTY
SET DELIBERATELY LOW
JUST TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
TEN MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT
I HAVE EVERYTHING IN WRITING AND IF THEY GIVE ME A QUOTATION
WELL QUITE AN EXPERIENCE FOR PAULA'S FIRST VENTURE AT THE AUCTIONS
SHE PAID WELL OVER THE GUIDE PRICE
I'M SURE SHE'LL DO A GREAT JOB OF MAKING SURE SHE GETS A GOOD JOB DONE BY THOSE BUILDERS
SO IF YOU WANT TO MAKE PROFITS
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY
BUT I'D RATHER DO SOMETHING WITH IT
THEY'RE GOING TO EXTEND ACROSS THE BACK
TO ACHIEVE AS MUCH AS YOU PHYSICALLY CAN
ONE'S FULLY REFURBISHED
WHICH IS FANTASTIC
I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH STORAGE SPACE BEFORE
THE BRANDED PLACE IS FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS
SO'S HOW YOU SAVE MONEY
WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS AREA
LOTS OF NATURAL LIGHT
THAT'S WHY I REMINDED YOU
I GOT ME ROLLING PIN OUT
THAT I DON'T MIND MEAN
I'LL GIVE A HUNDRED POUNDS TO THE PERSON WHO FINDS IT
THEY'LL RIDE UP WITH WEAR
THE MESSAGE IS FOR HER TO COME DIRECTLY TO MY OFFICE AND MAKE THE HUNDRED POUNDS REWARD PAYABLE
THIS IS NOT THE DOCTOR'S
WELL IT'S A PRIVATE MATTER
THE LADY IS ON HER WAY UP APPARENTLY
I'M GOING TO PUT IN ANOTHER HUNDRED POUNDS
IT'S NOT MOUNTED
AH WE ARE IN THE RUN UP TO A GENERAL ELECTION
IT'LL PROBABLY DRIVE ME MAD
BECAUSE I THINK
A CHOICE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO LIVE IN
NOT JUST THE PRIVILEGED FEW
WHEREAS LABOUR WILL INVEST IN THE NEXT GENERATION'S EDUCATION AND GUARANTEE THAT WORD AGAIN
AND IMPORTANT THOUGH IT IS
THERE IS A CHOICE OF TWO PATHS
THE BOTTOM LINE IS
THE BIG QUESTION
IS WHEN IT COMES TO PROPERTY
TRADITIONAL THREE BEDROOM
DAMP PLACES THAT ARE REALLY IN A STATE
IT'S READY TO ROCK AND ROLL
I'D BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT DOING ANY KIND OF RESTORATIONS ON THIS
MOVING THE BATHROOM UPSTAIRS
DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH IT
I THINK IT'S JUST A SMARTEN UP
POSSIBLY GET RID OF THE FIREPLACE
APART FROM THAT
IT'S QUITE QUITE A GOOD PARK
SO IAN SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
THE BIG QUESTION
IS POTENTIAL PROBLEMS
ONE THING FOR SURE
HE WON'T BE CARISE SELLING THE PROPERTY
ACCORDING TO THE NINETEEN ELEVEN CENSUS
THIS PROPERTY HERE WAS OCCUPIED BY A FAMILY OF JUST FOUR
USE YOUR EYES AND ASK QUESTIONS
IT'S GOT CHARM AND BAGS OF CHARACTER
IT'S IT'S A GOOD PRICE
DON NEEDS SOME WORK DOING TO IT
BUT JUST BECAUSE I WAS UNHAPPY AT WORK SO I SPOKE TO MY HUSBAND
GET THIS GARDEN SORTED OUT AND A GOOD BUY TURNS INTO A FANTASTIC PURCHASE
I'LL RUN THE SHOP
AND THAT'S NO BRAINER
YOU'VE GOT THE ADDED POTENTIAL OF THE OFFICE
CONVERT THE CELL
AND ADD EVEN MORE VALUE
IT REALLY IS A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY
AND I WAS JUST SITTING IN HIS LIVING ROOM AND
AND I LOOKED UP
IF I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
EVERY DAY YOU GO OVER YOUR SCHEDULE
THAT WHAT WAS MISSING IN THE FLAT WERE FIREPLACES
WHAT WE COULD DO IS
AND IT CAME OUT TO AROUND TEN AND A HALF
THEN WE MAY DO THAT
AND IT'S BEEN BRILLIANT
SO IF I CAN FIND ANOTHER ONE LIKE THIS
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN
IT'S THE TESCO TABLE TENS CLUB
WHATEVER WILL BE WILL BE
THAT WILL BE ALL
WE DON'T WANT EM LOSING CONTROL
THREE UNDER THE TABLE
WHEN MR GRAINGER COMES DOWN
FORTUNATELY FOR US AND GRACE BROTHERS
AFTER ALL THESE LONG YEARS
YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF A NEW HOME
AN INVESTMENT FLAT
SHE WAS INTERESTED IN A PROPERTY FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD ABOUT A YEAR AGO
PROBABLY BECAUSE IT NEEDS A NEW BOILER
SO BECAUSE OF THAT
IT'S BRILLIANT FUN
THE FLAT I'M HERE TO SEE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY MUCH TOGETHER AND IT HAD A VERY ATTRACTIVE GUIDE PRICE
WHICH WOULD BE HERE
FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE SPENDING LARGE QUANTITIES OF MONEY IN SORTING IT OUT BECAUSE
I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY LIES
RENT THIS PLACE OUT
IT'S QUITE A LARGE FLAT AND IT'S VERY
BUT WHEN WE SPOKE TO THE FREEHOLDER
AND LOVELY BIG WINDOWS
TO ACHIEVE OFFERS ANYWHERE IN THE REGION OF THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY
THAT WOULD BE GREAT
BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE AT AUCTION SO WE'RE GOING TO START ON THAT NEXT WEEK
SO IT'S ALL ALL HANDS ON DECK AGAIN
THE COMMUNITY CHURCH ON SHEPPEY
READY TO TAKE A PUNT ON AN AMAZING BUILDING
APPLY FOR CHANGE OF USE LATER
HOW ABOUT TURNING THIS INTO A BAR
A NIGHTCLUB MAYBE A CASINO
THERE'S TO BE NO SUNDAY TRADING
AND NO RELIGIOUS USE OUTSIDE THE METHODIST CHURCH WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION
COVENANTS CAN BE LIFTED
BUT ALL SUBJECT TO BOTH NEW AND ANCIENT RESTRICTIONS
IT'S BEEN ENCOURAGING
PEOPLE ARE RUNNING THEIR OWN BUSINESSES
IT'S A COMMUNITY'S DREAM
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST ANSWER
STILL MANAGED TO GET IN
SO I WAS OFF FOR THREE WEEKS
FOR THE DONKEY WORK
BECAUSE YOU GET THE GARDEN OF BITS AND PIECES
AND WE'VE REALLY DONE THAT
IT WAS RU AT AMONGSER COMMUNITY THAT THEY WAS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLEST ON THE ISLAND
THE FOOD THAT WAS HERE PEOPLE IN THE KITCHENS
IT WAS SUCH FUN
THINGS LIKE YOUR DOUBLE GLAZING
WELL THAT'S IT FOR NOW
THAT'S ABOUT TEN MILES NORTH OF MECCA
WORLD OIL HAS NEVER BEEN AT SUCH A LOW EBB
THESE ARE DARK DAYS
BUT I FEEL SURE THE END OF THE TUNNEL CANNOT BE FAR AWAY
TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK
WE'RE USING MORE COAL TO MAKE ELECTRICITY
YOU MEAN THAT CONTRARY TO MY INSTRUCTIONS ALL THESE HEATING APPLIANCES HAVE BEEN USED BEHIND MY BACK
ACTUALLY I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE
EVERY CONVICT MUST KNOW THAT MICHAEL DIED OF SNAKEBITE
HE PROVED HIMSELF MORE OF A MAN THAN MY TOMMY
I SAY THAT IN THE HOPE THAT THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOUR WILL AT LEAST BE
I WAS MARKED FOR EXPORT
I THINK I WAS NINE AT THE TIME
LAST YEAR I WAS HERE AND A FELLOW PULLED UP ALONGSIDE OF ME AT THE SAVOY HOTEL IN HIS CAR AND ASKED
I LOVE THE TEAR
TELL ME SOMETHING
I'M A GREAT ACTOR
PEOPLE KEEP PUSHING YOU ASIDE TO GET A LOOK AT JACK THE RIPPER
I DON'T MIND THE DOORBELL PLAYING POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE
YOU CAN TELL HE REALLY LOVES HIS WORK
I CAN SCARCELY BELIEVE MY EARS
DON'T BLOW YOUR TOP
I HAVE IT SECURELY ANCHORED
BECAUSE LAST TIME I WAS HERE I POSED FOR A STATUE AT MADAME TUSSAUDS WAX MUSEUM AND I WAS
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR TEN MINUTES JUST
AND I DID THAT WHILE I WAS GOING TO DANCING SCHOOL
I FOUGHT UNDER THE NAME OF REMBRANDT HOPE
AND THE TWO POLITICIANS
AND THEY LOVED THAT KIND OF STUFF
YEAH WHEN I WENT OUT TO HOLLYWOOD
I WENT DOWN TO THE DEL MAR TURF CLUB BALL
WHICH BEING OWNED PART OF
WE DID OUR ACT TOGETHER
AND IF I WENT ON HIS SHOW
SO ON PAGE SEVEN
AND THEN HE'D DOUBLE BACK ON ME
HAVE YOU EVER HAD A CROSSOR
HAVE YOU EVER HAD A ROW
I WAS THE LOUDMOUTH
I'LL GO UP AND TELL EM
HOW TO COMMIT MARRIAGE
BECAUSE THIS MOVIE IS DIFFERENT
MY COSTAR JACKIE GLEASON COULDN'T MAKE THE OPENING
YOU GOOFED IT THERE
BECAUSE THIS MOVIE IS DIFFERENT
THEY TOLD HIM AT THE AIRPORT THAT HE WAS OVERWEIGHT
PRINCE PHILIP AND THEIR FINANCIAL ADVISER
ALL THOSE REPORTS ABOUT HER MAJESTY'S MONEY PROBLEMS ARE JUST RUMORS
AND RICHARD BURTON IS FURIOUS
ALL THE STARS WERE IN LONDON
HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE LONDON CLINIC FOR A MONOCLE TRANSPLANT
THERE'S A NEW FLAG FLYING OVER THE BRITISH EMBASSY
THEY ARE SO POLITE THERE
ONE MORNING THE WATER IN MY BATHTUB GURGLED AND A PAGEBOY WALKED IN AND SAID
THE TOWELS DON'T SAY HIS AND HERS
IT WAS QUITE A THING
AND I SHOT A SEVENTY FIVE AND I BEAT HIM FOR FOUR DOLLARS
TRYING TO GET ALL THESE RESIDUALS
AND IT'S IT'S A FUNNY KIND OF A STRIKE WHEN A FELLOW CAN WALK OFF YOU KNOW A JOB AND GET INTO HIS ROLLS ROYCE AND
THE BEST GOLFING STORY
I'VE NEVER HAD A HOME ONE
IF I COULD GET A HOLE IN ONE
WOULD YOU GIVE FIVE YEARS OF YOUR SEX LIFE
SO I'D GIVE ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
WOULD YOU GIVE TEN YEARS OF YOUR SEX LIFE
THIS IS THE GREATEST DAY OF MY GOLFING CAREER
I DIDN'T GET YOUR NAME AND
DOLLAR AT BURNING TREE AGAINST SYMINGTON AND PRESCOTT BUSH
AND I PLAYED LOUSY
I PLAYED AGAINST THE PRESIDENT
I WASN'T PLAYING WITH HIM BUT
KNOW LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
YOU CAN MAKE GREAT
I MADE SIXTY PICTURES
PART OF THE TOP GUN GENERATION
QUITE BIG FAMILIES
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED NOW FOR COMING ON TWO YEARS
I'M A BIT RUSTY
WE WOULDN'T WANT TO CUT ONE DOWN FOR THE DAY
I'M FROM THE FALKLAND ISLANDS
YOU PUT BATTERIES IN THE CUFFS AND THEY AND THEY
IT WAS KIND OF AKIN TO POISON IF SOMETHING MADE YOU COLD
AH ROSKOFF'S OLD PORT
IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT THAT THE FIRST FRENCH ONION SELLER DECIDED TO TRY HIS LUCK AND CROSS THE
WE KNOW THAT TODAY YOU HAVE TO GET IT UP TO AT LEAST SEVENTY DEGREES CENTIGRADE
VICTORIANS USED TO LOVE THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SPECIAL
AND THEN IT SPILT OUT INTO A COURTYARD
YOU GROW INTO SOMEBODY ELSE
YOU HEAR OF SUDDEN CONVERSION EXPERIENCES
AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE
IT SEEMS THAT BECAUSE OF PENTECOST IT WAS A SUDDEN CHANGE OF CHARACTER
AND FOR THE MUSLIMS
YOU GO TO THE RA
ALL OVER THE WORLD
DEBATING THE LAW
PETER'S SHADOW WOULD PASS BY AND PEOPLE THOUGHT
MAKING PEOPLE WELL AGAIN AROUND THE TEMPLE
SO HE WAS A FANTASTICALLY IMPORTANT FIGURE
THIS KIND OF PERSON IS CONVERTING
AND WE WOULD TALK ABOUT CORNELIUS
BUT IT'S A HUGE MOMENT FOR PETER
WHO IS PROBABLY ALSO EATING NONCOHER FOOD
WHICH SHOWS THAT THEY'VE GOT TO BE RIGHT
THEY KNOW WHO THIS COMING KING IS GOING TO BE
PETER MAKES A MIRACULOUS ESCAPE
HE TRAVELS ACROSS THE CITY AND GOES TO A HOUSE
WHERE HIS FRIENDS ARE IN HIDING
BUT THE DISCIPLES WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS PETER AT THE DOOR
PETER'S IN PRISON
AND WHEN THEY OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW HIM
PETER MOTIONED WITH HIS HAND FOR THEM TO BE QUIET
WHERE DID HE GO
SHAPED BY VOLCANIC ACTIVITY FOR THE PAST TEN MILLION YEARS
NOT IN ISOLATED WAYS
BUT WITH BLESSING
SO THEY GET SORT OF CAUGHT UP IN THIS WHOLE SORT OF PENTECOST THING
SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WHEN THEY GO BACK TO CAPPADOCIA
IF HE THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE A RECEPTIVE AUDIENCE HERE
IF PEOPLE HAD ALREADY HEARD HIM
PERHAPS PERHAPS PERHAPS PEOPLE HAD SAID TO HIM YOU KNOW
AH WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS
HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN
THERE WAS A FAIRLY WELL SORT OF PLANNED OUT SERIES OF THE JEWISH DISPERSION
IN THE BOOK OF ACTS
AT PENTECOST WE HEAR THAT THERE ARE JEWISH PEOPLE THERE IN JERUSALEM FOR THE JEWISH FEAST
THEY'RE WORKING IT OUT
WORKING OUT WHAT GOD'S PLAN FOR THEM IS AS THEY GO ALONG
SO THEY'VE BEEN TAKING THE MESSAGE OUT
AND GENTILES HAVE BEEN COMING INTO THE MOVEMENT
SOMETIMES IN QUITE LARGE NUMBERS
THAT NOW HE CAN
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT HE VISITED AND SPENT SOME TIME IN ASIA MINOR
AND TRADITIONS ABOUT PETER AND PAUL VISITING THIS REGION STILL LIVES ON
HE GIVES A GREETING FROM SHE WHO IS IN BABYLON
BABYLON IS AH IS A WAY OF TALKING ABOUT ROME
WITH VERY STRONG LINKS BACK TO JERUSALEM
THERE IS AN EARLY TRADITION WHICH STATES THAT
UM I AM SKEPTICICAL OF THAT BECAUSE IN PAUL'S LETTER TO THE ROMANS
AND IT WAS WELL ESTABLISHED IN PETER'S TIME
THEY'VE LIVED PERFECT HUMAN LIVES THEY'VE
LIKE WE HAVE THE FIRE BRIGADE NOW
IT WAS SORT OF AN EYE FOR AN EYE
OR THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN PUNISHING HIM
IF PETER HAD BEEN ON HIS WAY TO MARTYRDOM AND SAID
I'M GOING TO DIE LIKE MY SAVIOUR
HE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN QUIETLY BEHEADED
WE CAN IMAGINE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CELEBRITY TO OTHER CHRISTIANS
WHEN THEY DID TRY TO TARGET CHRISTIANS
A VERY POPULAR ROMAN MARTYR
BUT ORIGINALLY IT WAS KNOWN AS THE BASILICA OF THE APOSTLES BECAUSE TRADITION HOLDS THAT THE RELICS
THIS BASILICA IS DEDICATED TO SAN SEBASTIAN
WE'RE IN YORKSHIRE
IT'S ALSO VERY RICH IN MARINE LIFE AND WE'RE ON THE PERFECT SPOT
SO I WENT OUT WITH KEITH CLARKSON
FIRST SIGN OF FLOWERS
FOLLOWING A LINE
WE THINK THAT THIS IS TO DO WITH THE CHANGE IN CLIMATE
AND WE WANT YOU TO JOIN IN
ALL OF YOU IN FACT
WE'VE HAD TEN OF THE WARMEST YEARS ON RECORD
IF YOU PULL ONE OUT
SO WE'VE TEAMED UP WITH THE SCIENTISTS FROM THE WOODLAND TRUST AND TOGETHER
BUT MARTIN IS DOWN IN MINSMERE
AND HE'S GOING TO BE TELLING US ALL ABOUT THE FIRST OF THE FIVE BIG SIGNS OF SPRING
THE MORE ACCURATE THE DATA WILL BE AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND IT IS VERY NIPPY TODAY
THERE ARE SIGNS OF SPRING ALL AROUND US
BUT IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS
THEY'VE HARDLY SWOLLEN AT ALL
WHAT IS IT WE WANT YOU TO ACTUALLY RECORD
IT DOES SEEM A LITTLE BIT SORT OF COLD
BUT WHERE'S WHERE'S THE BEST PLACE TO HEAD
SUCH A GORGEOUS
ELEGANT SIGHT AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE LAYING THEIR EGGS PRETTY SOON AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW
A LOT OF BIRDS HAVE ALREADY NESTED AND LAID THEIR EGGS
GO FOR YOUR VERY OWN WILD EASTER EGG HUNT
WE DID WATCH HARES BOXING AND HE INTERPRETED WHAT WAS GOING ON AND IT WAS TRULY FASCINATING
AS BEFITS SUCH A NEAT BIRD
COMPARED TO THE BODY OF THE ASET AND IMAGINE
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO COVER THEM
THEY'RE GOING TO GET CHILLED AND THOSE EGGS MAY NOT HATCH
BUT AS WE'VE SEEN
SO WE PUT UP THE THERMAL CAMERA AND WE GOT A MASSIVE SURPRISE
TRYING TO AVOID PREDATORS AND
I'M ALMOST CERTAIN
IT WOULD BE HEADING BACK OUT ACROSS THE NORTH SEA TOWARDS POLAND OR RUSSIA
BIRDS COME FROM THAT AREA IN THE WINTER
YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE SKY
I HAVEN'T COME UP HERE FOR THE SCENERY
THEY ALWAYS ARRIVE AROUND THIS TIME
AND THE BEGINNING OF APRIL
ALWAYS VERY WELCOMING THERE AS WELL
ANOTHER GREAT SIGN OF SPRING IS NOT AN ANIMAL ONE BUT A PLANT ONE THOSE FIRST WILD FLOWERS THAT
IN THE MEANTIME
SO FOR THESE FLOWERS
FOR SPRING FLOWERS
IT'S NOW ACTUALLY QUITE RARE
MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE SPRING FLOWER
JUST LIKE A CERTAIN VERY FAMOUS POET
GET OUT AND ENJOY THE WILD FLOWERS
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MEASURE HOW QUICKLY SPRING MOVES ACROSS THE UK
BECAUSE ARMED WITH THIS INFORMATION
AT SOME STAGE IN THE FUTURE
IT WAS ALWAYS A SHE
WHERE WE'RE AT NOW
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME WE SAW THAT
KIND OF GOING SAYING GOODBYE
THAT WAS A PHASE
I WAS REALLY DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT TO ALLOW HER TO WATCH THIS SHOW BECAUSE I GUESS I KNEW
THAT'S WHAT I AM
WHAT WHAT MADE IT IMPORTANT TO YOU TO DO SOMETHING STRAIGHT AWAY
I'LL HAVE BOTTOM SURGERY
HAVING TAKEN THE INTERVENTION
A SCAR ISN'T TOTALLY MATURE FOR A YEAR SO WE'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT BEFORE THAT AND THEN IF IT'S NOT
NOT THAT I CAN REMEMBER
IT WAS REALLY THAT WAS
BECAUSE HER FATHER AND I
DO YOU WANT TO STOP THAT
AND ONE IS WHAT
WHO YOU WERE QUITE FOND OF
PROBLEMS OR GET INTO ARGUMENTS OR
NOT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO BUT
SHE WAS CALLING IT LIKE A NO DEPTH VAGINA
WHAT HE CAN AND CAN'T DO WHEN HE'S WITH ME
I DIDN'T WANT THIS
WE'RE NOT AT THIS TIME
THAT'S THE EASY ROAD AND I HATE TO SAY THAT
I'M THINKING OF BEING COLD
PRACTICALLY TILL I'M
THE FACT THAT SHE HAS TO TAKE HER MEDICINES
THOSE ARE WORRIES THAT SHE HAS AS WELL
I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW
WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN AND TURNING FIFTEEN
THAT SHE WANTED TO BE SEBASTIAN AGAIN
IF THAT WAS THE CASE
WOULD NOT BE THE SAME AS SITTING IN OUR OWN BACK GARDEN WITH FRIENDS
JOIN THE PRIVACY
OF THAT VERY TREE
IT'S BEEN GIVEN THE NICKNAME SON OF ROYAL OAK
CLOSE TO LOCAL AMENITIES
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY
THE CONTEMPORARY FEEL AND THE PERIOD FEATURES THEY WANT
BUT HERE IN WONDERFUL SHROPSHIRE
HOW'S THAT GOING TO BE
YOU'RE ONLY AN HOUR OR SO AWAY FROM BIRMINGHAM AND MANCHESTER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS
AND THEY JUST OPENED A DIRECT TRAIN LINK FROM SHREWSBURY DOWN TO LONDON
STILL PEOPLE DO MOVE HERE BECAUSE OF THE LOVELY COUNTRYSIDE AND
SHROPSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL ARE THE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY TO DEVELOP A BIODIVERSITY STRATEGY
AND IT WAS AT THIS VERY SPOT IN SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE THAT CHARLES THE SECOND ESCAPED CAPTURE BY
IT'S GREAT BECAUSE IT BRINGS ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS INTO THE OPEN
I LOVE THIS PROPERTY
I'VE COME TO BOS HOUSE RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF SHROPSHIRE
IS CEMENTED OUR MINDS THAT
THAT WOULD BE IDEAL
IF YOU'D LIKE AN ENTREE INTO RURAL LIVING THEN
VERY WELL TOGETHER
SO THE OTHER GIRL THERE WITH BRAIDED HAIR
SHE SAID I THINK I SHOULD TELL YOU THAT IN GERMANY
LONDON IS A VERY SOFT WORD
STRAIGHT TO THE POINT
KING GEORGE THE SIX MADE BOGNER FUNNY
BUT COULD ANYONE RAISE A LAUGH BY SAYING LONDON
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD POINT THERE
YOU GO SHOPPING WITH HER
THAT'S QUITE EASY SHOPPING
SHE SAVES ME EVERY TIME SHE GOES SHOPPING
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THOSE
SO THE NEW FLOWER HAS GROWN
AND YOU' YOU ARE HAPPY WITH THAT HOUSE
ALL NIGHT THEY WORKED IN THE HOSPITAL
YOU ARE NOW A PERSON
YOU'RE GOING THIN
I'M HELEN AND I'M A CHEMICAL ENGINEER
SO I'LL HAVE TO GO FOR HARPSICHORD
AS FAR AS I'M AWARE
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
BUT I WOULD ANTICIPATE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE UPSTAIRS
NO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE IS REQUIRED
ON THE BORDER BETWEEN DERBYSHIRE AND LEICESTERSHIRE
I STILL WALK INTO A HOUSE LIKE THIS AND YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU' GOINGNNA FIND
YOU COULD JUST MOVE INTO THIS BUNGALOW AS IT IS
NOT THAT EXPENSIVE
FOR A GUIDE PRICE OF NINETY FIVE
THIS IS A LOVELY LITTLE BUNGALOW
IT'S A GREAT ONE
KEITH WITH SOME QUITE AMBITIOUS PLANS
NOT TOO MUCH OF AN ISSUE
IN TERMS OF THE STUFF IN THE PADDOCK
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET INSIDE THERE TODAY
IT IS INCREDIBLE
WHEN I HEAR THAT
I THINK THERE'S VALUE TO BE ADDED
I IMAGINE HOUSES THAT ARE UNMODERNISED AND IN DESPERATE NEED OF REPAIR
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT DEVELOPERS LIKE ME ARE KEEN TO GET THEIR HANDS ON
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL A LITTLE SMUG WHEN YOU SEE YOU HAVE MUCH MORE THAN DOUBLE THEIR SPACE
AND IF WE CAN'T GET PLANNING PERMISSION FOR THAT
WE MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE SOME COMPROMISES
YOU GET A CHUNK OF GARDEN WHICH IS GOOD FOR THIS PART OF TOWN
YOU MAY NEED TO SPEND SOME TIME OUT HERE WITH THE OLD GARDEN SHEARS
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'VE BEEN WITH SOMEONE SO LONG
SHE LOOKED ON THE INTERNET
WE ARE SPEAKING
I'VE GOT ABOUT TWENTY
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE REAR
MAYBE IT'S NOT IDEAL
AS A RENTAL PROPERTY
I THINK IT'S GOT GREAT POTENTIAL AND
I WAS POSSIBLY TIME WITH THE IDEA
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW
BIGGEST ISSUE
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS A HOUSE TO LIVE IN
THERE WAS FROGS IN THE CUPBOARD
THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT WAS BUT
BUT WE HAVEN'T MOVED IN THERE BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT I'VE HAD TO DO UP HERE
SO AT THE MOMENT WE'RE LIVING IN A CARAVAN
UM IT'S NOT TO THE STANDARD THAT I WOULD PUT ON THE MARKET AND WANT TO SELL IT ON THE OPEN MARKET
HOWEVER FOR A RENTAL PROPERTY
I WOULDN'T EXPECT TO SELL THIS IN TODAY'S MARKET FOR ANY MORE THAN FIFTY
IF ALL THE LEGAL PROBLEMS WERE ALL SORTED OUT AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR FROM THE OUTSET WHAT WE WERE
I WOULD AIM TO ACHIEVE BETWEEN SIXTY
REASONABLE RENTAL PRICE IN THE CURRENT MARKET
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE
AND I MEAN OVER A YEAR FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY
YOU'VE GOT SOME WONDERFUL BEACHES ALONG THE SOUTH COAST
WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTY
IT CAN GET EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE
IN ORDER TO MOVE THINGS ON
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR BUYERS
BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT
BUT WE WOULD LIKE A DINING ROOM
WE TEND TO DO ENTERTAIN FRIENDS QUITE A LOT
THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE SO
IT WAS GOOD THAT THEY'VE NOW GOT SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT
WHO STILL LIVES HERE
WELL LET'S MEET MY COUPLE
BUT TO SPICE THINGS UP A LITTLE BIT
DO YOU WANT THAT SORT OF READY AND MADE
THEY'VE GOT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND
THEY SAID RIGHT AT THE OUTSET
WE'RE OPEN MINDED
AND YOU CAN'T GET ANY MORE OPEN MINDED THAN OPTING FOR THE TYPE OF BUILDING THEY SPECIFICALLY SAID THEY
WE DON'T HAVE ANY
WE HAVEN'T HAD AN ARMY SINCE NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT
WITHIN OUR NEIGHBOURS
WE THINK OF AS AS PARTY PEOPLE GOOD
NEIGHBOURLY AND THEY HAVE MONEY
WE WANT YOUR COMPANIES TO PAY THE TAXES THAT THEY SHOULD PAY AND NOT JUST BE HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE
I MUST CALL MY FRIEND HE'S ON HOLIDAY IN CAPE FEAR
WILL YOU BE IN ON MONDAY
WHERE WE'VE LINED UP SIX PROPERTIES TO TEMPT TWO SETS OF HOUSE BUYERS WHO WANT TO MOVE TO THE SAME
PROBABLY AT AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED
WANTING TO BUY THERE
WE DON'T WANT THEM LITERALLY ON TOP OF US
AND SO I'M REALLY COMING HOME
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE I WAS BROUGHT UP
BECAUSE IT WAS TOO NOISY
WE'D LIKE TO AVOID LISTED BUILDINGS
WHICH WILL NEED RENOVATION
LET'S GET GOING
AFTER OVER TWENTY YEARS LIVING IN OXFORDSHIRE
WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED YOU WANT TO MOVE TO THIS PART OF THE WORLD
AND IN A FEW YEARS' TIME
I WOULD THINK THAT
BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF LAND THAT IT'S GOT
AND THE PLANNING PERMISSION
HAS BEEN A REALLY FUN FEW DAYS
IF I LIVED HERE
THE WAY YOU'RE TALKING
IT WAS SUCH A FIND
LOOK AT THE COMPETITORS AROUND YOU
LOOK AT THE AREA
I WAS REALLY RELIEVED
REGULAR PEOPLE COMING
ATTRACTIVE AND POPULAR
DO YOUR RESEARCH
AND WHAT A WONDERFUL TASTE OF DEVON WE'VE HAD
SO BEAR THAT IN MIND
ALL I'VE GOT IN HERE IS MY LAUNDRY
AND IF I DON'T GO SOON I SHAN'T GET A DRY
IT'S MY LORD R NIGHT
ONLY THIS MORNING
MY MOTHER'S AWAY FOR THE NIGHT AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME
REMEMBER WHAT MR CLEGG SAID
RIGHT THEM BEING ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WE SAY
WHERE'S THE CAMERA
I'VE BEEN CALLED
IT WAS A NICE TRY
YOU'D BETTER START LOOKING FOR YOUR CARDS
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT PROPERLY
YOU FEEL QUITE CONFIDENT
I CAN'T REWIND TIME
REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF
THEY ENJOYED IT
AND SHOULD I GO HOME OFF THE BACK OF THAT
THEN I'M GOING TO BE HAPPY
BUT AT LEAST WHEN YOU BUY AT AUCTION WHEN THE HAMMER FALLS
DUN DUN DUN DAH
AND THEREFORE THAT POTENTIAL PURCHASERS MAKE THEIR OWN INQUIRIES OF THE MORTGAGE LENDERS AS TO WHETHER THE
IT'S NOT A BAD ONE
FOR A FAMILY HOUSE
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO BUY THIS AND THEN RENT IT OUT
IT WOULD BE A RENT MACHINE
LET'S FIND OUT WHO FANCIED IT WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
SOME TENDER LOVING CARE
ALBEIT ONLY FOR A VERY SMALL THREE BEDROOMED HOUSE
THE PARTY WALL AGREEMENT
ONLY ONE TREE WAS FELLED DURING THE ENTIRE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION PHASE
MAY CAUSE SOME PROBLEMS AND DELAYS
BUT WITH A GUIDE PRICE OF JUST TWENTY FIVE
AND IT WAS BOUND TO CAUSE SOME INTEREST IN THE AUCTION ROOM
LET'S FIND OUT WHO MADE THAT WINNING BID
BUT RATHER CONTRARY TO THE TOWN'S FOUNDING PRINCIPLES
THIS GREEN SPACE HAS PLANNING PERMISSION TO BE BUILT ON
BUT AS YOU KNOW
HAVING INITIALLY BEEN REFUSED BECAUSE OF PARKING CONGESTION IN THE AREA
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH PLANNING AGAIN AND RISK REJECTION
UM SELF CONTAINED COMMUNITY
SURROUNDED BY GREENBELT
WHICH MAY IMPACT ON THE RESALE
SO DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS
THE EMPHASIS WAS ON TREES AND OPEN SPACES EVERYWHERE
AND I THINK HISS FOUR TO FIVE MONTH TIMESCALE WELL IT SEEMS A LITTLE AMBITIOUS
ESPECIALLY FOR HIS FIRST PROJECT IN ENGLAND
AND ALL THIS WORK FOR ONLY TWENTY FIVE
HE'S GOT TO BUILD A WHOLE HOUSE
LET'S SEE HOW HE TACKLES THESE CHALLENGES LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
THEY WILL BE LOOKING PRETTY MUCH AT WHAT THEY PAID FOR IT
AROUND THAT SORT OF SIXTY MARK
IF THEY CAN GET THEIR MONEY BACK
SO FROM A RENTAL OR SELLING POINT OF VIEW
IF WE CAN GET FIVE HUNDRED
YOU COULD LET IT OUT
POUNDS BUT WHEN IT WENT TO AUCTION JUST RECENTLY
THOUSAND PUBS CLOSED LAST YEAR
BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS ON
YOU REALLY GOT TO DO YOUR RESEARCH ON THE LOCAL AREA
WHAT IS REQUIRED AROUND HERE
IS IT REALLY WORTH TAKING IT ON
AND THEN CONSIDER IT VERY CAREFULLY
I'VE NOT REALLY THOUGHT OF IT
I THINK IT'S A GOOD PRICE I PAID FOR IT
THOSE CHALLENGES ARE INTENSIFIED
BUT WILL HIS SECRET WEAPON
COME TO THE RESCUE
YOU CAN FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW
AND TAKING THEM ON AS A BUSINESS
WELL THAT'S AN APPEALING THING BUT REALLY IT IS A CHALLENGE WHICH IS NOT FOR THE FAINTHEARTED
THE QUESTION IS
WHICH ON PAPER SEEMED VERY ENTICING
IT'S A LOT OF PROPERTY FOR FIFTY EIGHT
IT'S JUST BEEN THROUGH AN OPEN MARKET AUCTION
HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO VERY MUCH TO IT
DRAWN OUT PROCESS BUT
C IT'S MADE OF MUNDIC BLOCK
IT'S MADE OF MUNDIC BLOCK
MUNDIC BLOCK IS ACTUALLY PRETTY MUCH STONEWORK THAT'S BEEN MADE FROM THE RESIDUES OF THE MINES IN
OFTEN IT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM
SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE PROPERTY CHECKED OUT
THIS PROPERTY HAS GOT A B GRADE FORUNDIC BLOCK
WHICH MEANS IT'S
THE HOUSE ITSELF THEN
YOU CAN ONLY REINSTATE ONE PROPERTY
I WAS LOOKING TO INVEST IN IN SOME PROPERTY ANYWAY AND THEN THIS CAME UP SO IT WAS AN IDEAL
TO SORT OF GO IN WITH MUM AND DAD
AND OBVIOUSLY THEN WITH THIS PROPERTY THERE'S LOTS OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE
WHETHER WE DEVELOP IT
SPEND ANY MONEY
DO ANYTHING AT ALL
THAT IS AN EXPENSIVE WAY TO ADD TO YOUR GARDEN
YOU CAN BE IN LONDON WATERLOO IN JUST OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF AND SOUTHAMPTON IS LESS THAN TWENTY
YOU ALSO HAVE STRONG ROAD LINKS HERE
THE M THREE IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE
YEAH I THINK IT WOULD MAKE THIS HOUSE MUCH MORE SALEABLE
FOR THIS PROPERTY
SOMEONE WAS UP FOR THE JOB
I WENT AND DONE SOME FIGURES ON IT AND I THOUGHT
GOOD STRONG RENTAL MARKET IN THE MOMENT
WE'RE GETTING SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY PO A CALENDAR MONTH
TOM JONES WAS BORN AND BROUGHT UP AROUND THIS AREA
IT'S A FOURORY FIVE BEDROOMED HOUSE OF MULTIPLE OCCUPATION
YOU REALLY GET YOUR MONEY OUT OF THIS ONE
LET'S FIND OUT WHO FANCIED IT WHEN IT WENT TO THE AUCTION
THAT WOULD BE TWO
BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT RENTING THIS OUT
UNLIKE NEW YORK
I DON'T THINK THERE ARE TOO MANY STARS ON THIS PARTICULAR STREET OF THAT NAME
WHICH IS ALWAYS NICE
IT WOULD BE A MINIMUM OF NINETY THOUSAND
FIND OUT IN A MOMENT
IT'S ALSO BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN PERCENT CHEAPER
SOME INTERESTING PROPERTIES
BUT WHAT DO TODAY'S HOUSE HUNTERS WANT
ONE EVENING I COUNTED A THOUSAND
WE WERE GOING TO BUY IT BUT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A HOUSE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF A VILLAGE
WITH THREE OR FOUR BEDROOMS
AND ALTHOUGH JOHN IS FULLY ON BOARD
YOU WANTED IT TO HAVE THE WOW FACTOR
LET'S HOPE YOU FEEL THE SAME ABOUT OUTSIDE
SO WILL THIS ONE HIT THE MARK
THEY WERE TWO UP TWO DOWNS
ANYTHING UP TO ABOUT TWELVE WEEKS
SOME PROPERTIES ON THE INTERNET
QUITE A DAUNTING TASK
BUT I THINK YESTERDAY WENT REALLY WELL
IF ONLY WE COULD MOVE A PUB AND A SHOP ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE DOWN THE ROAD
THEN WE MIGHT HAVE CRACKED IT
BUT TODAY IS A NEW DAY
BANG GOES THAT SURPRISE
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK INSIDE
THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING I MEAN
THEY ARE NATURE LOVERS AND THIS IS A PRIME LOCATION
BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS
HAVE WE FOUND THEM THEIR PERFECT PROPERTY IN THE CENTRE OF A DREAM LOCATION
SOMETHING THEY'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR FOR SO LONG
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
THEY'RE GOING BACK TO LOOK AT ONE OF OUR PROPERTIES FOR A SECOND VIEWING
WE WISH THEM THE VERY BEST OF LUCK TOGETHER
IT'S THE RESULT OF IT
WE WOULDN'T HAVE SIGNED THE FIRST TIME
I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU
MASSIVE BLOUSY TRUMPETS BUT
BUT THE SAME TIME
THOUSAND YEARS ALL OVER THE WORLD
SO WELCOME TO RHS WISLEY
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT A BULBFUL OF GARLIC WITH A LITER OF WATER AND BLITZ DOWN TO THE MOST FINE
IF YOU'RE PLANTING LILY BULBS IN THE GARDEN
WE SEND BULBS OUT AT THE END OF FEBRUARY
APART FROM THIS AVALANCHE OF FLOWER HERE
I'VE HAD MY CHIES FOR AT LEAST SIX YEARS
I HAVE NOT WATERED THEM
I HAVE NOT FERTILISED THEM
AND THAT'S THIS WHEN THEY'VE STOPPED FLOWERING
ALL THAT ENERGY THAT THE LEAVES ARE MANUFACTURING
IT FULFILLS ALL THE CRITERIA LOW MAINTENANCE
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE
SO WHEN THE STEM COLLAPSES
I REALLY HAVE TO TRY
SO ABOUT TWENTY DEGREES
SO SORT OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF OF EVOLUTION THAT WE WOULD BE
THIS WILL SURVIVE AND THERE'S SOMETHING VERY
I USED TO GO INTO OUR WOODLANDS AROUND WHERE I LIVED
YOU'LL BE SWEATING FOR HOURS
PUT THEM IN A PLASTIC BAG
SO IF IT'S ONLY GOT ONE HOLE
I'M GOING TO PUT THIS IN THE CORNER OF MY GARDEN
SO I'M GOING TO START FROM THE BACK AND MOVE FORWARD
GET YOURSELF A DRILL
AND IN A CONTENT THIS SIZE
TO EMBRACE THE PLANTS THAT THRIVE IN IT AND CREATE A LITTLE BIT OF WOODLAND MAGIC IN
CAPTAIN SOLOMON PEACOCK
BUT FROM NOW ON
THEY'RE HAPPY WITH THEIR SALARIES
THEY DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO CHANGE AT ALL
MY WIFE GOT OUT OF THE BATH GAVE A CUP
I AM FOR A COAT LOOKING
I WISH A WARM COAT BECAUSE IT IS COLD
YOU ARE A TOURIST
WELL THERE'S ONLY ONE THING I LIKE
COULD BE THE WAY YOU'RE CARRYING IT OUT
I'M SURE WE'RE ABSOLUTELY ON THE RIGHT TRACK
THAT'S THE ONE WITHIN NICE
AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN THE PROBLEM HERE
IT DOESN'T FAZE ME
BROUGHT YOU BACK
REALLY GOOD FEMALE PEST CONTROLLER
MAY DAMPEN DOWN THE POPULATION FOR A LITTLE WHILE
SHE WANTS TO CONQUER THIS
SHE KNOWS THAT IT'S INAPPROPRIATE
I THINK SHE'S CLEANED UP A LOT
I THINK SHE'S MOVED STUFF AROUND
REALLY LOVE AND I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THEM AGAIN
I REALLY FELT IT
TO GET A DISH TOGETHER
I KNEW IT FROM THE OUTSET
AH LOSING TO ONE OF THESE GUYS
I DEFINITELY WOULD
BUT I THINK TO GO OUT ON A BAD DISH WOULD BE REALLY DISAPPOINTING
WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF ELEMENTS ON EACH DISH
I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR ABOUT NINE YEARS NOW
THERE'S DEFINITELY BITS AND PIECES ON THEM
LET'S SEE IF IT WORKS
SO MY MY THING WOULD BE
RASPBERRIES REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE
YOU GET STRAIGHT INTO IT AND GO AGAIN
TRY ANOTHER SWING
OTHERWISE EVERY TIME IT RAINED
SEE THIS IS HALF WOOL AND HALF EXTRUDED MANADE FIBRE
AND SOME THAT I WON'T
WHAT I MEANT WAS
GET INTO A NICE HOTEL
TAKE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE
THIS WHOLE DEPARTMENT IS IN NEED OF REDECORATION
I CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT
I USED OVERNIGHT TAN
HELP YOU THROUGH LIFE'S WEARY PROBLEMS
ONE FLIGHT OF STAIRS
THEY STARTED THE WHOLE THING
IF YOU'VE TRIED TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR DOCTOR OR BEEN TO AN A AND E RECENTLY
WHAT'S THAT MESS ALL ABOUT
LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S NOT HARD TO GUESS
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS
THE KING'S BIRTHDAY
TO SHOW THAT EVEN WHEN THEY ACT TOGETHER
WE LEAVE HIM THERE
YOU WERE A SOLDIER FAR FROM HOME
NEVER GIVING YOU A SECOND THOUGHT
I WILL APPROACH YOU AND I WILL SAY
THEY WOULD KILL YOU FIRST
YOU SAW IT WITH YOUR OWN EYES
YOU DID NOT READ IT IN A FILE
AH FRUIT BEING SOURCED FROM AROUND THE WORLD
THE SO CALLED MAD COW DISEASE
PEOPLE LIKE THAT
WOULD YOU LIKE AN APER OF CHEESE
CHILDREN OUT AT SCHOOL FOR LONGER AFTER SCHOOL CLUBS
I IMAGINE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A REAL HELP
WOULD EXPLAIN WHY IT EXPLODED AT THAT TIME
THE SALAD HAS BEEN TIPPED OUT
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED THERE COULD BE A CONNECTION BETWEEN BSE AND ITS HUMAN FORM
EVERYONE LIKES IT
BECAUSE YOU CAN BUY READY MEALS
BUT I THINK WE MIGHT BE IN DANGER OF LOSING SOMETHING
FOOD WASN'T FUN
FOR MOST PEOPLE
YOU CAN CHANGE THEIR WHOLE EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD
SO MANAGING THEM PROPERLY IS VITAL
AS TOM'S BEEN FINDING OUT
THAT WOULD STIMULATE OUR WOOD CULTURE IN WAYS WE CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE ANYWAY
IT SEEMS THAT WE'RE IMPORTING THE PROBLEM
ON THINGS LIKE SAPLINGS
BUT WE CAN SLOW IT DOWN
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOW
WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE HIGH PEAK DISTRICT OF DERBYSHIRE AND I'M GOING TO BE MEETING A TRULY
TEN MILLION RU HERE
I WORRY ABOUT THIS PLACE
I WORRY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
IT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL
I ALMOST WANT TO SAY
AH YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT LOBO AND USING HIM AS ALMOST THE FIRST PERSON IN YOUR FAMILY TO
BECAUSE HE'S ONLY TWENTY FOUR
I THINK HE'S ONLY THIRTY FOUR HE LOOKS OLDER
AND IT'S BEEN A LONG SEARCH
NATHAN LIKED MY FOOD
THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT
AND WE NEED TO FIND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT
HOW'S THE KITCHEN LOOKING
IT HAS COME OUT EXACTLY THE SAME
THERE WE HAVE BEN'S
I DON'T WE'D DRAMATIC ABOUT THIS
NOW WE'VE GOT TWO THINGS
GOT LIKE WIMBLEDON
ALL IT IS IS SHE NEEDS SOMETHING REALLY GOOD TO HAVE UP HER SLEEVE AS SHE APPLIES
ANDY WINS A RALLY
I WAS THINKING MAYBE IT'S LIKE THE PHOTO'S
WITH EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
MEAN YOU HAVE TO THINK
WOULD IT HELP US AT ALL HERE IF
I'M JUST THROWING THIS OUT THERE
WOULD IT HELP US IF WE THOUGHT ABOUT REIMAGINING IT SOMEWHERE A BIT MORE LIKE
AND WE ALL FEEL THE SAME ABOUT THAT
MY JOB IS JUST TO ASK THE QUESTION
BUT HE SAID JUST SOMETHING ABOUT SCARBOROUGH AS A PLACE AS A PRECINCT
WHEN IT COMES TO THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS ON THE DAY ITSELF
I WAS THINKING MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE FAMILY FACE OFF
OR MAYBE JUST FAMILY
TOTAL CAR CRASH
WHEREBY IN THE EVENT OF A PROBLEM IN ONE AREA
OR I SHOULD SAY UNLESS
PLEASE LET US KNOW
IT IS WIMBLEDON
I JUST THINK THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF RENEWAL
AND ONLY IF THE SITUATION ARISES
BUT HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TOWARDS SKI BECAUSE OF
CAN YOU STAND UP AND SAY THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO
THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE AS LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION
AND NOW I FEEL READY
NICE LITTLE FEEL ABOUT IT
SO I THINK THAT'S MASSIVE
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'VE GOT ANY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF
I WENT TO SEE A BEHAVIOURAL THERAPIST ABOUT IT
BECAUSE THE SEVEN TWENTY NINE FROM BRIGHTON INTO VICTORIA NEVER DOES ARRIVE ON TIME
THIS WAS THE BRITISH RAIL HEADQUARTERS
THEY WANTED TO BREAK UP THE UNIONS
THAT REALLY HASN'T HAPPENED
THEY WANTED TO REDUCE SUBSIDY
YOU WOULD HAVE SOME TRAINS WHICH WERE UNBELIEVABLY CRAMMED AND SOME TRAINS THAT WERE COMPLETELY
AH GENERALLY THE SMALLER ONES ALONG THE LINE
ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S TRACK
BUT THE REALITY IS
IT IS YEARS OF WORK TO MAKE THESE THINGS
ON THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES ROUTES
IF I COULD GET MANCHESTER IN TWENTY MINUTES
THEY'VE STILL GOT THEM
THAT IS A RELATIVELY LOW PROFIT MARGIN
YOU WOULD FIND THAT IN THE SUPERMARKET BUSINESS
ARE LARGELY RISK FREE BECAUSE
I GET THE IMPRESSION THEY TAKE PROFITS FROM AN ACTIVITY WHICH
IT'S GOT FOUR BILLION A YEAR SUBSIDY
AND THE REAL QUESTIONS
A HEARING BEFORE THE DELAY ATTRIBUTION BOARD
THERE WERE MORE THAN TEN
THE TOWN WHERE I GREW UP IN NORTHERN IRELAND
BUT HERE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
THE RAILWAY IS STILL ONE HUNDRED PERCENT STATE OWNED AND IT'S VERY EFFICIENT
WHICH HAVE A PRETTY FREQUENT SERVICE ANYWAY
PULLING OUT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION AND SAYING
WE ARE ABLE TO INVEST
THEY'VE STUMPED UP THEIR OWN MONEY TO INVEST IN OUR RAILWAY
THE GERMAN STATE
SO WE ARE NOT COMPARING LIKE WITH LIKE
I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT TO GO BACK AND SAY IT WAS ALL WORKING ALL RIGHT THEN
I'VE SEEN SOME NONSENSE
WE NEED TO DO BETTER
BUT IF IT GETS THINGS WRONG
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THAT MEANS
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT
AND SOMETIMES WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS ACTED IN A WAY THAT WOULD LEAD THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN TRUST
YOU GET ON WITH THE JOB
THE MOST CRUCIAL PART
IS ENTIRELY STATE OWNED AND STATE CONTROLLED
WE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE A COUNTRY AT EASE WITH ITSELF
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TRADE
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SKILL
AND I KNOW THAT
NONSECTARIAN PARTY
ONE BASED ON TRADE
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE
IMMIGRATION RUNNING AT SENSIBLE LEVELS
IF YOU WANT CHANGE
LET'S MAKE THIS A BETTER COUNTRY
IF YOU BELIEVE IN BRITAIN
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH HAPPENED BUT I HERE
I'M JUST WONDERING THE ETHOS OF THE PUB
WHEN IT JUST CAME OUT
WE NEED TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION
AND WHEN I SAW THAT REACTION
I THINK HE REALLY WANTED THIS JOB
SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT I TAKE THE RENTS
ALL I CAN SAY IS
PLAN IN THE SHADOWS
TO HAND OVER THE KEYS
YOU TOLD THEM HOW MUCH FOOD WE HAVE
ONE OF THEM PEELED AN APPLE WITH A KNIFE
IT'LL BE A TRAP
STICK WITH ME ON THIS ONE
AND THERE'S ALSO THE RISK OF FLOODING
WHETHER NATURAL OR MAN MADE
IT WAS HERE IN THE ROARING TWENTY S THAT KITTY
FRESH OUT OF UNIVERSITY
SHE WOULD TELL THEM AS WELL
SO BY THE END OF A SEQUENCE OF THESE SORTS OF FEATURES
BUT DON'T GET OVERAWED BY THE SIZE OF IT
THE COMMON NAME IS DAYLILY
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE
BUT I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME OF THE SEED AND PROPAGATE THEM TO CREATE SOME NEW PLANTS FOR ANOTHER
AND THEY'RE NICE AND MOIST
BUT THEY CAN GET LIGHT TO THEM AS WELL
AND THEN REALLY REMEMBER TO KEEP IT WELL WATERED
IF YOU UNDERSTAND A FEW THINGS ABOUT THEM
BLUEBERRIES NEED TO BE GROWN IN ERICACEOUS COMPOST
BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK
JUICY BERRIES IS ULTIMATELY THEY'RE DELICIOUS AND EVERYBODY WANTS THEM
AND THAT'S NETTING
SO IF YOU WANT YOUR FAIR SHARE
YOU DON'T GET ANY FRUIT
SO WE DO THE FIRST PRUNING IN JUNE
BUT YOU CAN TREAT ANY GOOSEBERRY IN THIS WAY AND
CAN WE SMELL SPRING
WHICH IS ABOUT EVERY TWO TO THREE MONTHS
AT A TIME WHEN GLASGOW WAS KNOWN AS THE SECOND CITY OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE
WHICH WAS MORE THAN THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF GLASGOW
ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT QUESTION
VERY FOND MEMORIES OF IT
AND THE HUDSON BAY COMPANY
AND THEY STARTED OFF BY MAKING
IF YOU'D CARE TO TAKE IT OFF
NOW PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE MARK
WE'LL DO YOUR INSIDE LEG
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE
DECORATING COMES UNDER MAINTENANCE AND
THE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE STEPTOR GOT THERE FIRST
IT'S A BIT HARSH
ON BEHALF OF GRACE BROTHERS
AND THERE ARE NOW TWO MILLION MORE PEOPLE IN WORK WITH THE SECURITY OF A PAY PACKET
WE'VE HALVED THE DEFICIT AS A SHARE OF OUR ECONOMY
WHILE CUTTING INCOME TAX FOR OVER TWENTY SIX MILLION PEOPLE
THANKS TO THE HARD WORK OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE
WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO A BRIGHTER
SO VOTE FOR THE CONSERVATIVES ON THURSDAY AND YOU WILL HAVE THE SECURITY OF A PLAN THAT IS WORKING
YOU'LL HAVE STABLE GOVERNMENT AND THE STRONG ECONOMY ON WHICH OUR SCHOOLS
OUR NHS AND YOUR FAMILY'S FUTURE DEPEND
BUT VOTE FOR ANY OTHER PARTY
PROPPED UP BY THE SNP
WOULD WRECK THE RECOVERY WITH MORE DEBT
WHEN LABOUR WERE LAST IN OFFICE
LABOUR'S LEGACY WAS A DEFICIT ALMOST AS LARGE AS THAT OF GREECE
SO OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS
THAT IS WHAT WE'VE HAD TO MEND
THAT IS WHAT OUR LONG TERM ECONOMIC PLAN HAS BEEN ALL ABOUT
THOUSAND LOAVES OF BREAD
OR YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET THE REALLY HARD BIT
RUN IT UNDER THE TAP AND PUT IT IN THE OVEN
AND IT MAKES IT COMPLETELY PALATABLE AGAIN
BUT ACTUALLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF EFFORT
IT WILL SAVE MONEY IF WE CAN MAKE THE MOST OF THOSE BREAD ENDS
MAKE A SANDWICH
I KEEP MY BREAD IN THE FRIDGE
MY MUM KEPT BREAD IN THE FRIDGE
WHETHER IT BE HOW MUCH WE BUY OR REVIVING IT WITH WATER
IT ALLOWS YOU TO GET MORE WATER IN
YOU KNOW THAT FORECAST COULD GO UP TO FIVE MILLION
SHE MUST BE KEPT SEPARATE
AND WE GO THROUGH MILK IN HUGE QUANTITIES
MEANING STRAIGHT FROM THE COW
SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT HUNDRED
AND WE WILL MAKE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SEVEN
BUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
IN THIS HALL WOULD HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
ONCE THAT'S DONE
I'VE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT WHERE IT COMES FROM
I WANT JOE INTERROGATING TOM MALLORY
IN JUST A MOMENT
THIS COAST WAS DEEMED TO BE THE END OF THE WORLD
LET'S MEET THEM AND FIND OUT
I'M IN THE ALGARVE ON THE SOUTH COAST OF PORTUGAL
BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY PAY
WE WOULD HAVE PLAIN
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS NOW
WE'VE SHOWN TONY AND HILARY SOME GREAT HOMES HERE ON THE ALGARVE AND RECEIVED SOME PRETTY
BUT WILL IT BE A STEP TOO FAR
AND MAKING A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY
IT ALSO REPRESENTS A BRAND NEW WAY OF LIFE
I THINK HE'S ONLY THIRTY FOUR HE LOOKS OLDER
AND IT'S BEEN A LONG SEARCH
OH THAT WILL SELL SEED AROUND
SO ANYONE CAN CREATE IT
FOR TIGHT CONSTRUCTION AND
REALLY GOOD HORTICULTURAL KNOWLEDGE
IN ORDER TO GET THAT WHOLE PACKAGE RIGHT
IT'S ALSO ABOUT HORTICULTURE
SO THEY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT
I'M IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT
I THINK I'M READY TO MEET NEW CHALLENGES AND
BELIEVE IT OR NOT
AND IF I'M SUCCESSFUL AND WIN
AS YOU WALK TOWARDS
IT REALLY STANDS OUT
YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE
I THINK I'VE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH IT ALREADY
THERE IS A BIT OF DEAD
BECAUSE IT JUST MAKES ME SMILE
EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT IT
A COTTAGE GARDEN IS OVERFLOWING
I REALLY WANT HER TO FINISH
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE SAID IN HIS BRIEF IS IMPORTANT
YOU'RE GOING HOME
IT'S IT'S REALLY HARD
HOW DO YOU THINK HE'S INTERPRETED THE STORY BECAUSE I THINK HE'S DONE A WONDERFUL JOB
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS GARDEN IS SHE HAS SET HER BRIEF
SHE'S GONE AT IT
BUT FOR ONE DESIGNER
THERE ARE NOW FIVE DESIGNERS IN THE RUNNING
IF YEAH IF THIS IS A GARDEN ABOUT ABOUT LOVE AND ROMANCE
IT MEANS AN AWFUL LOT
IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT
I MUST HAVE GOT THE DIMENSIONS WRONG SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE
I WAS PLACING IT HERE
AND THE THOUGHT OF BEING ABLE TO GET THERE AND TO PUT ON A GARDEN IS
AND THE MOOD CHANGES OF EVERYBODY INTO
NOW THIS IS NOW SERIOUS
EVEN THOUGH I'M LOVING THIS
HAVE YOU GOT ENOUGH PLANTS
I'M A LOT HAPPIER
AND THE PERSON NOT GOING TO CHELSEA IS
I SUPPOSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
ON THE PLUS SIDE
AND I KNEW THAT
YOU WALK IN HERE
THIS IS THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH HAVING A VERY
VERY SIMPLE PATTERN
VERY SIMPLE FORMALITY
I WANTED IT TO BE MORE CONTEMPORARY
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S IN MY FAVOUR
AMONGST ALL OF US
NOBODY WANTS TO GO HOME
AND I WAS THINKING I WAS SWAYING MORE ON THAT SIDE THAN GETTING COLD
YOU NEED SOMEWHERE TO ATTACH THESE THINGS TO
IT'S INCREDIBLY HEAVY
IT'S VERY DENSE
THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT
I STOOPED TO CONQUER AN INSIDE LEG
HE WAS ON HIS KNEES
AH SO WE'VE GONE METRIC
BEING OF AN AFFECTIONATE NATURE
I HAVE MANY FRIENDS OF ALL SHAPES
EVEN THIS MORNING
AS IT'S HER HALF CENTURY
WE OUGHT TO MAKE IT REALLY GOOD
IT ISN'T THE STORY OF MY LIFE
SO SHE CALLS ME SHIRLEY
MISS BRAHMS AND MYSELF
HERE IS YOUR DESCANT
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU
TO GET ACTUALLY INTO CHELSEA
JUST THAT OPPORTUNITY ALONE
DOES THAT CONCERN YOU
ITS THE FINAL
AND WE COULD LEARN A LOT FROM FERNS FROM THAT
I'VE LISTENED TO YOUR COMMENTS AND I THOUGHT
IT'S A ONCE IN A LIFETIME CHANCE
BUT I WANT TO SHOW THEM HOW PASSIONATE I AM ABOUT PLANTS AND
THERE CAN BE NO COMPROMISES
I WANT TO BE RENDERED SPEECHLESS BY THESE GARDENS
I DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET TO BUY THE MATERIALS
SO TO EITHER BUY THEM OR BUILD THEM
AND WITH THE MONEY
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUY NINETY OTHER PLANTS
I'VE GOT TO DO A LOT MORE
AND I KNOW THAT'S A RISK
THIS IS HOW MUCH I WANT JEALOUSEA
YOU SHOULD BE PLANTING TODAY
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY FINE IN AN EDUCATIONAL SPACE
SO HE IS KIND OF CONCENTRATING ON THAT DETAIL
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE UP AND DOWN
SHADOWS ROUND THE CLOCK
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS
THAT CHANGES MATTERS
BUT YOUR BODY LANGUAGE
TELL YOU EVERYTHING
WHY DO I NEED TO DRIVE
EVERYONE LOVES LISTS AND SO PEOPLE
POST FUNNY LISTS AND
WE STICK TO THOSE THREE CHORDS
IT'S THE PERFECT COMBINATION
AND THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE TV SHOWS
YEAH WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT
HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES
FOR REASONS I'D RATHER NOT GO INTO
IF ONE WERE DROWNING
THEY'RE CHANGING THE LOCKS NOW
AND I SHALL SEE TO IT THAT YOUR NAME APPEARS IN EVERY NEWSPAPER
THEY'RE VERY DEEP
WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER THE CAKE ON MR GRANGER'S HEAD
WHEN I WAS IN THE NAVY
WE ARE MEN OF INTEGRITY
I'M SURE YOU CAN DOUBT YOUR HUSBAND NO LONGER
THE MOMENT YOUR WHEELS LEFT THE GROUND
AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING TO ME FAIR PLAY
YOU WILL DO THAT
I DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR A HAT
WE ARE GOING TO TRAIN YOU TO BE GUNNERS ON MERCHANT SHIPS
WHAT ABOUT THREE YEAR PREGNANT
YOU WILL GET USED TO
AND ONE HOTELIER SAID
MOVED OUT FROM HIM
WHERE DO YOU START IN ALL THIS LOT
I GOT TO TRY AND QUEER YOUR PITCH
BUT THEN I SAID JIM
ALL HELL WAS BREAKING LOOSE
WHAT TIME DO YOU OPEN
SARDINES ARE OFF
BUT I WILL BRAND NO
AND SHE'S HOURS OF PITCHING
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT SHIP THERE
AND I WAS STOOD ON
TO COOL THE GUN BARRELS OFF TO KEEP FIRING
IF I FORGET YOU
JUST GIVE ME THIS DAY
WHICH IS THE WORST TIME OF THE DAY
WE'RE NOT FAR AGO NOW
THE MEN THAT WE'RE FIGHTING WITH
WE WOULD LAUGH AND GIGGLE
AND SAVING THIS COUNTRY
AND TO BE A FIGHTER PILOT
WHEN YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
THEN THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE WILL BE COMPETITIVE
BECAUSE EVERYBODY LOVES GROWING SWEET PEAS
THEY'VE GROWN IT
THEY'VE PICKED IT BUT
WEIGH IT CAREFULLY
OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN MINUTES
TAKE OVER BBC ONE TO HAVE YOUR SAY ON WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ON TV IN THE PAST WEEK
TO FIND THE BEST GARDENER
IT MUST BE SAID
INTO THE SECRET OF JUST EXACTLY WHO HAD WON
AND ALL OUR FARMING HEROES
THE BBC CERTAINLY LOVES A GOOD COMPETITION
AND TUESDAY EVENING'S HOLBY CITY
WHERE ONE PATIENT UNDERWENT A VERY SERIOUS OPERATION WHICH INVOLVED REMOVING A SMALL PART OF HIS
SEAN MURRAY EMERGED AS THE OVERALL WINNER
SO IS THIS A CASE OF DRAMATIC LICENCE GONE TOO FAR
JUST AS WELL AS EVER
SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE
NEW AND ORIGINAL KIND OF COMEDY SHOW
HERE IS SOME OF YOUR CHOICE PROGRAMME FOR THIS WEEK
UNTIL NEXT SUNDAY
THAT IS JUST ABOUT IT FOR THIS WEEK
WE WILL HELPED EACH OTHER
WHEN WE DID OUR FINAL INSPECTION ON THIS AIRCRAFT
AND THAT SHOWS YOU WHAT LEVEL OF DETAIL THEY LIVE THEIR LIVES BY AND THEREFORE WE HAVE TO REPLICATE
ONE FUEL UNIT IS AS MUCH AS YOUR HOUSE
I'M ACTUALLY SCARED
IF THAT EVER HAPPENED
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE DOING IT
EARLIER THIS YEAR
WE COULD PROBABLY STRETCH TO FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE
BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION
DOES THE COUPLE'S PERFECT HOME EXIST ON THEIR BUDGET HERE IN THE SOUTH DOWNS
JUST NOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE STATION OR THEY WERE TOO FAR OUT IN THE STICKS
ATTRACTING NEW VISITORS
BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
FUNDING IS NOW AVAILABLE TO LOCAL ENTREPRENEURS WANTING TO MAKE THEIR BUSINESSES MORE SUSTAINABLE
SO WITH THAT IN MIND
LET'S HOPE THE ONES WE'VE LINED UP FOR THIS WEEK'S COUPLE FIT THEIR BILL
DRAMATIC LANDSCAPES AND AREAS OF GENTLE
BUT I FEEL THAT
A BIT OF SAILING
IT'S ONLY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES DOOR TO DOOR
GEORGIE CERTAINLY HAD HER RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE COTTAGE
BUT WILL SEEM VERY TAKEN WITH IT
AND I THINK IT REALLY HAS PUT THINGS IN A SPIN IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY
HE HAD A LARGE NUMBER AND HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY RICH MAN THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF THE MIDDLE
WILL CERTAINLY KNOWS THIS AREA
AND VERY CLOSE TO HIS HEART BY THE SOUNDS OF IT BUT
I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT THE PROPERTY BUT
BUT AT THAT PRICE
AND HE GAVE THE PULPIT
SO ARE IN A POSITION OF STRENGTH IN THE CURRENT MARKET
LOOKING AT THE COTTAGE
IT'S TIME FOR THE MYSTERY HOUSE AND I KNOW THAT WILL AND GEORGIE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE ON A BIT OF A
BECAUSE WHEN WE BEGAN THIS HOUSE HUNT
I WAS REALLY CONCERNED THAT WILL AND GEORGE'S EXPECTATIONS WERE JUST TOO HIGH
FANCY GRACE BROTHERS BEING ABLE TO DO THEM AT THAT PRICE
A FULL RANGE OF SIZES IN ALL THOSE LOVELY COLOURS THEY WASHABLE
WE MUST ALL BUY SOMETHING FROM HIM SO HE CAN AFFORD A PROPER LUNCH
JAMMED UP AGAINST A RADIATOR IN AN EMPTY FLAT
BUT IF YOU'RE NICE TO ME
SHE NEEDS HIM AT A TIME LIKE THIS
AND THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SHE LEFT FRANCE AND ACTUALLY MOVED TO THE UK
WHICH WE CAN TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT
THE NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES
SO PEOPLE WOULD GO TO THE EXHIBITIONS BECAUSE THEY COULD SEE PEOPLE THAT THEY WERE READING ABOUT BUT
THIS WOULD GO ON TOP OF IT WITH THE CANDLE
ITS QUITE A NICE ONE
AND PERHAPS NEVER WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE IN LIFE BUT
AND CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW FREAKY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
ECLECTIC SELECTION OF ITEMS
I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS
THAT'S WHAT MAKES COURSE THE ANTARCTIC SO INVITING
AND IF YOU WANT TO TRY AND FIRE THE IMAGINATIONS OF SPONSORS
THERE'S SOMETHING QUITE ARRESTING ABOUT HOLDING UP A PIECE OF PAPER AND SAY
AND PLANT THEM THERE
SOME NO BIGGER THAN PEBBLES
MYTH AND LEGEND
THIS FOREST HAS REMAINED PRETTY MUCH UNTOUCHED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
THERE'S PLENTY MORE FOR YOU TO SEE
VERY CLOSE TO THE LOCAL AMENITIES AND TRANSPORTS
VERY VERY MUCH SOUGHT AFTER
AND IT'S NOT CHEAP
SO MAYBE SELF CATERING COTTAGES
THOUSAND OF THEM MOVING HERE EVERY YEAR
THE MAIN REASONS CITED FOR THAT MOVE ARE IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE
SHORT COMMUTER DISTANCES AND THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF YOUR FIRST CHOICE SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE
AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE
THE PRICES ARE HIGH
AND THE AVERAGE DETACHED HOUSE COMES IN AT SIX PERCENT MORE THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE
YOUR MONEY CAN GO THAT LITTLE BIT FURTHER
IF YOU MOVE TO SOUTH SOMERSET
HOME TO WILD BEASTS LIKE THE BROWN BEAR AND THE WOLF
BUT NOW THEY ARE BOTH EXTINCT
CHANGE OF LIFESTYLE
AND I'M TOLD THERE ARE STILL ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED ROAMING THROUGH THIS LAND
IF IT'S HOLIDAY LETS
HAVE YOU DONE THE MATHS ALREADY
THAT'S LAPSED NOW
OF WHICH THEY DO TODAY
PARTICULARLY THE MALES
NOT ONLY ARE THEY MOVING COUNTY
THEY WANT TO TAKE ON A BUSINESS WITH BABY FIVE OR SIX HOLIDAY LETS WHILE BRINGING UP THEIR LITTLE DAUGHTER AND JONATHAN
IT IS MYSTERY HOUSE TIME
MAYBE FIVE SIX SEVEN HOLIDAY LETS
BUT SUCH AN AMBITIOUS PROJECT
UM BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT A YOUNG BABY TO THINK ABOUT AS WELL AS RUNNING A BUSINESS
AS WELL AS JONATHAN WORKING IN LONDON
WELL IT'S BEEN AN EXCITING JOURNEY
TO REALLY TEST YOU
WE TOOK YOU TO THE MYSTERY HOUSE
WHEN IT COMES TO ACTION
I'M AFRAID I MUST RESIGN
IT'S GONE DOWN IN THE MINUTES
ALL YOU DO IS BOUNCE THEM
CUDDLE THEM OR TURN THEM ON
I APPEAL TO YOU
IF YOU WANT TO GET OFF THE GROUND
THERE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE ALTAR
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
INDEED YOU'VE ALL DONE VERY WELL
I TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT RESIGNING AGAIN
THEY WERE SEALED UP
SO IN A SEALED ENVELOPE
WHICH THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO OPEN
THE ORDER WENT OUT
YOU HAD FRIENDSHIP FRIENDSHIPS STRUCK UP JUST IN A YOU KNOW DAY OR TWO BETWEEN
KEEN TO ESCAPE THE CITY
AND WITH MANY SECOND HOME OWNERS
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU GET FOR YOUR MONEY
YOU ALSO WANT A NEW LIFESTYLE AND POTENTIALLY SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN RUN A BUSINESS FROM
BUT GOING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE
BUT THE QUESTION IS
ALWAYS IS IT GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO FIND THEM EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
LAND DOESN'T COME CHEAP
AND GARAGE STROKE WORKSHOP IS IS AN AREA THAT WE WOULD THINK OKAY
OR CHUCK IN ANOTHER FIFTEEN GRAND AND YOU GET THE HOUSE
ITS A VERY VERY GOOD PRICE FOR A VERY SPECIAL HOUSE WITH A VERY SPECIAL VIEW
THIS ONE REALLY WAS QUITE SPECIAL
ONE OF THEM WILL BE THEIR IDEAL ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRY
DO YOU WONDER THAT
IF THE RECORD IS TO BE BELIEVED
FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE
ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE MR LU
WELL DON'T SAY ANYTHING NOW
THAT'S JUST OVER THREE POUNDS COMMISSION
IS NOT MY WIFE'S FRIEND
IT'S FOR MY FRIEND
WOULD YOU MIND PUTTING IT ON
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT MR GRACE
A PRAM WAS BEING PUSHED ALONG A NOT SO VERY DIFFERENT STREET
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT
BY A COINCIDENCE
WE HAVE DISCOVERED
I JUST MISSED MY BUS
BY A COINCIDENCE ALMOST BEYOND BELIEF
AND I WAS STANDING THERE
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME
FORFEITING MY PLACE IN THEQUEUE
WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE FOR A JOB
FIVE DAYS LATER
YOU WERE EMPLOYED BY GRACE BROTHERS
AND ONLY MR GRACE KNOWS THE REASON FOR THAT CHANGE OF MIND
RIGHT FIRST TIME
ONCE YOU CAME UNDER MR GRACE'S HAND
YOU NEVER LOOKED BACK IN FACT
NONE OF US EVER LOOKED BACK
THEY WOULD HAVE OTHER JOBS
FROM THE OUTSIDE
THEY COULD OFFER QUITE A LARGE REWARD FIFTY
WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT TWO AND
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
POUNDS THAT HAS GOT TO BE A HELP
UNLESS SOMETHING REALLY GREAT HAPPENS TO ME
OR A PAPAL PARDON
WHERE THOMAS AND I ARE DEFINITELY SAME WAVEWIN
AND THE PITY WITH IT IS
BUT TODAY'S COUNTY INSPIRED ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST FAMOUS ROMANTIC PAINTERS
HE PAINTED THIS VERY SCENE
PAINTING WONDERFUL SCENES LIKE THIS
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK RURAL ESCAPE
BUT YOU'D BE AMAZED JUST HOW MUCH RUSTIC CHARM THIS COUNTY HAS TO OFFER
THAT'S EIGHTEEN PERCENT ABOVE NATIONAL AVERAGE
AGENTS SAY THAT FOR EVERY MINUTE OF COMMUTE TIME
PLUS IT'S MANAGEABLE TO GET TO MY WORKPLACE
MY FIRM RELOCATED ME A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
MAYBE WITH BEAMS
PAST THE KISS ME QUICK BOOTHS
IN ORDER TO FIND THEIR DREAM COUNTRY PROPERTY
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE
IN YOUR CASE I SHOULD SAY
PROBABLY FOUR HUNDRED ISH
I THINK THAT MALCOLM AND ANNE WOULD HAVE BLOWN THE BUDGET STRAIGHT AWAY
IT'S JUST THE EIGHTY S ADD ON THEY'RE NOT REALLY KEEN ON
WELL BEFORE THEY COME OUT
AND I'M NOT SURE HE WANTS TO BE TOO REMOTE
I THINK I THINK THAT'S THE CASE
I WOULD SAY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN
SO BUT THAT'S NOT INSURMOUNTABLE
HAVE YOU SEEN A LIST
MUST BE UNDER THIRTY
MUST BE ABLE TO GET ON WELL WITH ARAB ROYALTY
THEY'VE ALREADY VOTED
ANDREW MCNAIRN FROM ABERDEEN
HE HAS RATHER A LOT OF HAIR
THE STORE'S JUST CLOSING
FOLLOWED BY MY RESIGNATION
I WON'T BE FAMILIAR WITH YOU ANY MORE
WHEN WE GET INTO THE OTHER ROOM IN
I WON'T EVEN ADDRESS YOU AT ALL
THAT'S VERY KIND
WENT TO A PAWN SHOP
SO A FARSIDE POSITION
AS THE NEW PLAYGROUND FOR CELEBRITIES SUCH AS ELIZABETH HURLEY
KATE MOSS AND KATE WINSLET
TODAY'S BUYERS MAY WELL BE HOUSE HUNTING HERE AT THE RIGHT TIME
BUT WILL THEIR BUDGET MATCH THEIR EXPECTATIONS
WITH HOUSE PRICES DROPPING A WHOPPING NINETEEN PERCENT SINCE THEY PEAKED IN THE SUMMER OF
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE QUITE DIFFICULT TO PLEASE
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY'RE AFTER IS A DETACHED HOUSE WITH BAGS OF CHARACTER AND THREE BEDROOMS
WE'VE GOT THE MYSTERY PROPERTY
AIRY RECEPTION ROOMS WITH HIGH CEILINGS AND DEFINITELY NO BEAMS
AND IDEALLY AN OUTBUILDING WHICH THEY CAN CONVERT INTO AN OFFICE
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED
AS I THINK THAT WOULD BE
DOESN'T QUITE WORK
LONG LOUNGE THIS WAY
I FEEL I'VE GOTTEN PRETTY CLOSE BUT SO FAR NONE OF THE PROPERTIES I'VE SHOWED KAREN AND GARY HAVE
JUST RECONFIGURED TO BE
IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING JOURNEY AND A REAL EYE OPENER WITH A FEW SURPRISES ALONG THE
TO FIND EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE AFTER I THINK THEY MAY HAVE TO UP THEIR BUDGET BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME
AND DON'T LET'S BOTHER DRESSING UP
SO AFTER WE'D LOOKED THEM OVER FOR ABOUT AN HOUR
IF ANYBODY DOES ASK ME TO DANCE
WE TOOK IT IN TURNS
UM WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT
DON'T WORRY IF THE NIGHTSHIRT IS TOO LONG
SOME PEOPLE ARE BORN WITH IT AND
BUT WILL THEY BE STRONG ENOUGH
LIFE IS LIKE A GAME AT CHESS
EXCEPT FOR MR GRAINGER
I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST HIM
SO WE COULD DO WHAT THEY DO WITH FAITHFUL OLD HORSES WHO COULD NO LONGER PULL THEIR HEAVY LOAD
PRESSING THE DOWN BUTTON
ALEXANDER THE GREAT WAS ONLY MY AGE WHEN HE DIED
I ANSWERED NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH
HE WAS THOROUGHLY OBSTROPULOUS TO ME
HOW COULD HE DO A THING LIKE THAT BEHIND OUR BACKS
OUR COLLEAGUE HAS JUST UTTERED THE MOST DIFFICULT PHRASE IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE I'M SORRY
TWENTY THREE POINTS AND OVER
THIS IS A CRISIS
EIGHT BY TWELVE
ANY FOUR FROM NINE
BECAUSE THE FIRST PRIZE THIS WEEK IS FOUR HUNDRED
HAS GOT SO MUCH PRIDE
I JUST WANTED TO CHAT REALLY
WHICH IS BOTH A CITY AND A REGION ON THE SPANISH MEDITERRANEAN COAST
SPAIN WAS LEFT WITHOUT A KING OR AN HEIR AND THE FRENCH
NOT WANTING TO WASTE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THEIR EMPIRE
CROSSED THE BORDER
THE ENGLISH DIDN'T LIKE THIS ONE JOT
SO THEY JOINED FORCES WITH THE AUSTRIANS AND BY SEVENTEEN OH SIX
IT WAS TO BE SHORT LIVED
BECAUSE SIXTEEN MONTHS LATER
WE'VE HAD SEVERAL HOLIDAYS THERE SORT OF SEPARATELY OVER OVER THE YEARS
FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO COME AND VISIT
BUT IF WE DO FIND A NICE PROPERTY WITH A COTTAGE
POSSIBLY A BUSINESS COUPLES RETREAT
I THINK YOUVE GOT SO MANY IDEAS
SO WHATEVER THE VALUE ON THE PIECE OF PAPER
FIRST IMPRESSION VERY NICE BUILD
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I GREW UP IN SOUTH AFRICA AND I LIVED ALL MY LIFE LIKE THAT
I THINK IT'S A BEAUTIFUL HOME
I THINK IT'S IT'S GLORIOUS
I COULD SEE MYSELF LIVING HERE WITH PAULA
ONE BIG PRACTICALITY THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT
AND THAT'S PRICE
THERE IS A WHOLE LOT OF HOUSE THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
AND IM VERY SURE KEN AS WELL
THE GROUNDS ARE SO EXTENSIVE
PROBABLY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PRIVACY MORE THAN ANYTHING
IT'S GOT A HUGE POOL
AND SO YOU DON'T GET
YOU DON'T GET AUTUMN
YOU DON'T GET SPRING
YOU LOVE YOUR OUTSIDE SPACE AND YOUR MIND
YOU GET YOUR VERY OWN BULLRING
I'M NOT SURE HOW KEN FEELS
THEY JUST HAD THIS INKLING OF AN IDEA THAT THIS IS MAYBE WHERE THEY' WOULD LIKE TO LIVE
THEY ARE PRACTICALLY ON THE VERGE OF MOVING HERE
WITH THEIR CAN DO
BUT TO IN MY OWN MURDER MYSTERY
I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHO HAS BEEN MURDERED
WHO THE SUSPECTS ARE
THE BUSH COCKS IN THE GARDEN
I'D LOVE TO TRAVEL
PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY
AND THEN I GAVE HALF OF THE BED TO YOU
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
JUST ME AND MY BUTLER
I DIDN'T FIND THE WAY OUT AND IT'S OVER
YOU GOT ME SICK
AND IGNORE ALL THAT STUFF I SAID BEFORE
IF ESTEBAN NEVER GOT OUT
THEY HAVE THE LARGEST BRAIN OF ANY FISH AND FOR A LONG TIME
AND PEOPLE WEREN'T REALLY SURE WHY
YOU NEVER GROW OUT OF IT
THIS IS A RISKY TIME
YOU SHOULD RATHER AVOID THIS TIME
THEY GET ON BOARD AN AIRLANE AND WE TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN'T SMOKE
THEY CAN'T USE THE MOBILE PHONES
THEY NEED TO PUT THE SEAT UPRIGHT
FIRST AND BUSINESS CLASS
TRYING TO GET THEM TO COME WITH YOU
THEY GUIDE A COMPANY WITH TWENTY
AND THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO DIVERT INTO ORLANDO OR MIAMI WHICH
JUST REASSURE THEM
UM SHARE INFORMATION WITH THEM
WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT
AND WE START FILMING THE NEXT SERIES IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS
I'M REALLY EXCITED
I'M NOW GETTING PINK WAFERS AND CHAMPAGNE INVOLVED
SO IT USED TO GROW SO WELL
IT'S BEEN GREAT
BUT COOKING WITH HIM
HE'S A FOOD LOVER
I EMBARKED ON THIS JOURNEY TO KNOW MORE ABOUT ARGENTINIAN BEEF
TO GO TO THE PAMPAS
TO SEE THE GRASS
IF EVERYBODY EATS THREE OR FOURPAN
SO WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW IS THIS MASSIVE STEAK
AND WE CALL IT A TOMAHAWK
THAT'S WHAT I'VE JUST WORKED OUT
THANK YOU SO MUCH
KNOW WHERE HE GREW UP
AND THEY SAID EVERYBODY MIXES TOGETHER
I LIKE MY CITY COMFORTS
JUST HOPE I GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
THE MALAYS HAVE BLOOD
GET TOO FRIENDLY
THAT SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE BIT RESTRICTIVE
BUT YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT
I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT WHEN I COME TO MALAYSIA
EVERYBODY'S CLAIMING IT'S
IS THAT NOT SO VERY FAR FROM THIS VERY SPOT
BEFORE THEY STARTED IN THIS PLACE
EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD ATE FLATBREAD
BUT IT'S NOT CRUNCHY
AND YOU'VE ARRIVED EXACTLY THE RIGHT WAY
AND COAL FROM SOUTH WALES
TO HELP US THROUGH THE YEAR
THE DROPPINGS CAN CARRY WORMS
START EATING THE FOOD AWAY
CONTROLLING IT MYSELF
AND THEN YOU TAKE OFF
WAITING FOR PEOPLE
SOUNDS LIKE THE CLICHE
SOMEWHERE IN EUROPE
THEY'RE ALL FINE
TWO HUNDRED TOILETS ACROSS ALL OUR AIRCRAFT AND ON AN AVERAGE DAY
IT'S JUST THE SORT OF THE END OF THE BEGINNING
I'M GOING TO BE STAYING HERE ON JERSEY AND DISCOVERING THE LEGACY LEFT BY WORLD RENOWNED NATURALIST
THEIR BEDDING WAS THEN DRIED
HIS LEGACY IS STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE
IT'S FEEDING TIME
THERES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WEEDS
WE HAVE POPPIES
BUT BLACK GRASS IS CERTAINLY THE WORST CASE
AND THEY BUILD UP
GUERNSEY WAS LIBERATED FROM NAZI OCCUPATION
THEN MR MAI TOLD ME A GREENHOUSE ROBBER
WE ALL CELEBRATE AND ENJOY TOGETHER
IF SOMETHING BECAME RESISTANT TO THE CHEMICAL
RATHER LIKE WITH THE TALK IN THE PRESS ABOUT ANTIBIOTICS RECENTLY YOU KNOW
YOU KNOW IF YOU RELY HEAVILY AND SOLELY ON ONE ELEMENT
SHE'S VERY AFFECTIONATE
WHEN HIS SIBLINGS GET WEANED FROM THE MOTHER
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S THAT DESIRABLE
THAT PEOPLE REALLY DID FEEL VERY
THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION
AND I'LL BE TESTING MY TASTE BUDS WITH THE FLAVOURS OF THE SEA
SO WHEN WE INITIATE THE EXPLOSIVES AND WE COME BACK UP
THERE YOU KNEW THE BLOCK MOVED BECAUSE
I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH LEAVING
SO WHAT'S THE LATEST I HAVE TO BE OUT FOR AND WHEN CAN I BE BACK IN
SO YOU'LL HAVE SO MUCH MORE LIGHT IN THE STATION
SO WE'RE NOT PART OF THE CONSTRUCTION SO MUCH BUT
WHAT I'M GOOD AT AND WHAT I ENJOY
A LOT OF PROPERTY AND GOOD POTENTIAL FOR A BUY TO LET
LET'S HOPE WHOEVER BOUGHT IT CHECKED IT OUT BEFORE THEY PAID THEIR MONEY AT AUCTION
IF YOU'VE DONE YOUR RESEARCH AND YOU'VE WORKED OUT YOUR BUDGET
BUT SOUTH IS EXACTLY WHERE I AM
UM IN THE SOUTHERN CITY OF SOUTHAMPTON
BUT IF IT WENT TO ABOUT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND
THIS IS THE FIRST FLOOR FLAT
FOR A TWO BEDROOM
FOR FOR ONE BEDROOM FLATS IN THIS LOCAL AREA YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT AROUND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS PER CALENDAR MONTH
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK WE COULD ACHIEVE IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE
MAYA IS JUST SO LAID BACK
I REALLY HOPE SO
CERTAINLY IF I WAS TO BUY THE PROPERTY
I THINK CERTAINLY IT'S BEEN A GOOD INVESTMENT
WHERE CAN YOU GET A THREE BEDROOME DETACHED HOUSE FOR A GUIDE PRICE OF FORTY FIVE
TO MAINTAIN THE MODESTY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM
A REASONABLE SIZE
IF YOU THINK ABOUT RENTING THIS PLACE OUT
WE HAVE GOOD ACCESS TO JUNCTIONS TWENTY EIGHT AND TWENTY NINE OF THE M ONE
IT DOES HAVE ITS OWN TRAIN STATION NOW AS WELL AND I THINK IT IS VERY WELL POSITIONED IN THE CENTRE OF THE
STANDING BI OVER BY THE BAR AT FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND
MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT STEVE LISTENS TO THE ADVICE AND DOESN'T BUILD THAT EXTENSION WHICH WOULD
I WONDER WHAT THEY'VE BEEN UP TO
LET'S GO BACK AND FIND OUT
WHICH IS STILL NOT TOO BAD
WHICH IS A SMALL FLAT
AND WITHOUT A KITCHEN AS WELL
IT'S QUITE GOOD
SO WE HAD TO TRACE TRY AND TRACE IT BACK AND DIG A HOLE IN THE GARDEN AND WE FOUND IT
BECAUSE WE'RE DOING A LOT OF THE WORK OURSELVES
I'VE BEEN HERE SIXTEEN YEARS
I'M AFRAID I MUST HAVE A DECISION
MY BRAIN PICKS UP THE ELECTRICAL VIBRATIONS
AS SENIOR ASSISTANT
IS HE READY FOR IT
FORGIVE ME IF I DON'T MAKE A SPEECH
WE DIDN'T PUT JUNIOR IN THE ADVERTISEMENT
WOULD YOU ALLOW ME
SHE GETS FAR TOO FAMILIAR
MY MOTHER BURST INTO TEARS ON THE DOORSTEP THIS MORNING
SPLIT THE COMMISSION THREE WAYS
BESIDE I DON'T THINK I'M TEMPERAMENTALLY SUITED
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY SELLING IT FOR SIX
WHEN SHE ASKS YOU WHAT'S THE BEST YOU CAN DO ON SOMETHING
SO IT'LL IT'LL BE FINE
I THINK HE'S BEEN QUITE SAFE
THERE'S NO PLOUGHS
THERE'S NO AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS
I JUST WANT YOU TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU MARRIED ME
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH RONNIE
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH
RONNIE GOES DOWN
I CAN FLOG A SIXTY PERSON MO CRUISE IN UNDER TWENTY MINUTES
WEEKS WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT HIM
SHE IS IN THEIR LIVES
BETWEEN THE ORDINARY AND THE MIRACULOUS
BUT A REMINDER OF A PRESSING REALITY
WHAT MATTERED WAS THE HOUR OF YOUR DEATH
WHEN YOU TOO MIGHT BECOME LIKE ONE OF THE THREE DEAD
WANDERING THE EARTH
WITH TORMENTS DESIGNED FOR PARTICULAR SINS
THE REAL WORLD WAS NOT THIS ONE
BUT WHATEVER THE ANSWER
TO THAT THERE WAS NOTHING BIZARRE ABOUT DIVINE INTERVENTION
PROBABLY BOTH AT DIFFERENT TIMES
THE MIDDLE AGES WERE NOT THE MIDDLE AGES
VISITS FROM THE WALKING DEAD
RELIGION IS A MATTER OF CHOICE
THE CHURCH WAS NOT AN ASSOCIATION OF LIKE MINDED INDIVIDUALS GETTING TOGETHER BY CHOICE
EVERY PARISH CHURCH WAS BUILT WITH A CEMETERY
EVERY PARISH CHURCH IS FULL OF THEM
THEIR AWESOME POWER WAS ESPECIALLY PRESENT IN THEIR PHYSICAL REMAINS
THE ROADS OF MEDIEVAL BRITAIN WERE BUSY WITH PILGRIMS
MEN AND WOMEN PREPARED TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES
USUALLY ON FOOT
AS WELL AS INNUMERABLE PIECES OF BONE
THE SHRINE OF SAINT THOMAS OF CANTERBURY
YOU WENT ON PILGRIMAGE TO PRAY FOR A CURE
ABROAD AND AT HOME
SUPPOSEDLY THE SITE OF JESUS'S RESURRECTION
AND FREE IT FROM MUSLIM RULE
THE LOCAL APPRENTICES
A HERMIT WHO SAID
HE WAS FOR TEN YEARS RECTOR OF THIS CHURCH
THE WEALTH AND POWER OF THE BISHOPS
ANOTHER ASSAULT WAS LAUNCHED AIMED AT THE HEART OF THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH
AND THIS TIME WHAT FOLLOWED WAS A FULL SCALE WAR OF IDEAS
THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH WAS ABOUT TO FACE ITS OWN DAY OF
A GROUP OF REBELLIOUS BARONS
IT MEANS HIS KNIGHTS
DIRECTING THEIR THEIR ACTIVITIES
THEY ARE THERE TOO
LETTERS TO THE POPE
AND THIS IS BECAUSE
MAKES HIS WAY TO
AS FAR AS I KNOW
IT'S A MOMENT OF OF REAL CRISIS FOR THE ENGLISH POLITY
THEY'RE NOT ABOUT GETTING RID OF PEOPLE'S GOODS
WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO MEET YOUR MAKER
BUT THEN THIS IS THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING
BUT WHAT A RESPONSIBILITY
AND THEY WERE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO HELP
GIRLS PLAYING FOOTBALL AND AND SHOWING THEIR LEGS
TO SEE THAT
POTENTIAL CROWD OF SIXTY SEVEN
SO THE CHALLENGE WAS ACCEPTED BY THE TEAM
WHICH IS A SERIOUSLY
THEY DECIDED TO MAKE THEIR FIRST SALEABLE RECEIVERS
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE
SO THERE WAS SOME FRICTION
A COMPROMISE WAS REACHED AND THEY PUT WITH THE TWENTY TWO TWO YEAR OLD
NOW THIS IS A BELTER
THANK YOU SO MUCH
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN AN OFFICER
NOT AS IN GOODBYE
I WANT TO BE CONSIDERED FOR ADVANCEMENT
HE PUT ME DOWN ON THE LIST
SO IF ANYTHING COMES UP IN THE EXECUTIVE LINE
THAT MISS BRAHMS DOES NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE FOR SUCH A RESPONSIBLE JOB
AND I SEE THAT AS HEAD OF DEPARTMENT
I SUGGEST THAT YOU ADVERTISE THE VACANCY FOR MY POST
I KNOW THE VERY PERSON
HE WAS A LUMBERJACK
MADE TO MEASURE
NOW I'VE GOT YOUR JOB
YES YOU HAVE MY AUTHORITY TO PROCEED
I SUGGEST YOU GET ON WITH IT
SORRY I WAS A BIT SHORT WITH YOU AT THE DINNER TABLE
THIS IS YOUR LUXURY
FIRST QUALITY TURKISH
BECAUSE TWO WEEKS AS MANAGEMENT
IF MISS BRAHMS'S FIGURES DROPPED
CHARLIE HAD SUCH GOOD SUCCESS YESTERDAY
BUT IT IS IT IS LOVELY
SHE'S LEARNING FAST
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE LOST THE PLOT
I THINK YOU MIGHT DO IT
I SUPPOSE EVERYONE NEEDS ONE
AND FREE TO BE SALVAGED
WE'VE REALLY GOT TO HAVE A
I'VE GOT PLENTY OF FOOD STORE
WHEN IT GETS COLDER
AND THERE'S NOT AS MUCH FOOD AROUND
THE PREPARATORY WORK IS ALL IMPORTANT
BECAUSE ONCE YOU'VE GOT IT IN THE GROUND
IF YOU HAVEN'T PREPARED RIGHT
AND ALTHOUGH WE NOTICE THAT IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE MORE TECHNICAL BITS
POSSIBLY QUITE THIN CARROT
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE CARROTS
THERE'S OTHER OPTIONS OUT THERE
WE JUST MADE A FEW MISTAKES AND
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS SOMETHING THAT'S ATTRACTIVE
THAT TEMPTS YOU TO EAT IT
I DON'T WANT THE CHUTNEY TO BE TOO SHARP
AND TO LEARN THE AMAZING AMOUNTS THAT WE'VE LEARNED
THINK AGAIN BECAUSE
AS WRONG AS IT MAY BE
IF YOU HAVE A GOOD MANUAL TOOTHBRUSH AND FLUORIDE TOOTHPASTE AND YOU BRUSH FOR TWO MINUTES
THAT'S WHAT'S NEEDED
MY EVERYDAY LIFE
AND THINGS LIKE THAT
WHEN I'M TALKING TO A MAN
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING
WHEN YOU CHEW IT UP
THERE'S MAINTENANCE INVOLVED
A MINUTES COUNT HERE
THE QUICKER YOU GET IT BACK IN YOUR MOUTH
BECAUSE WE CAN USE SIXTY TIMES MORE CONCENTRATION THAN A NORMAL OVER THE COUNTER PRODUCTS
BECAUSE YOU ALMOST CONVINCE YOURSELF
THIS ISN'T A MASSIVE
BRED PURELY FOR FASHION
BUT THEY'VE GOT A SURPRISINGLY LONG AND INTRIGUING HISTORY
THE MISS AMERICAN PEOPLE
AND BE ABLE TO TURN IN A SPACE SO IF THEY WENT DOWN A FOX'S BURROW THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO TURN ON
IT'S ALL THE WOLF
THEY'RE VERY GOOD EXCAVATORS
SO IT'S ALMOST A BIT LIKE PALM READING
AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE THESE DOGS WERE BRED TO LIVE AND EXIST
WHETHER THAT'S DIGGING HOLES IN YOUR GARDEN OR EVEN IN OXFORDSHIRE SWIMMING POOLS
IT'S AN EFFICIENT PROCESS
EXCEPT FOR ONE BREED
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH THIS DOG SHAKES IT'S NEVER GOING TO GET DRY
AND THEY ARE WONDERFUL
THEIR OFFSPRING HE CROSSED WITH A RED SETTER AND AGAIN BACK TO THE TWEED WATER SPANIEL
VERY SMALL DOGS YOU COULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT MAYBE THEY WERE BED DOGS
THEY WERE KEEPING THE BEDS WARM BUT
THE BREEDING OF DOGS
THOUSAND OR MORE YEARS
YOU KEPT THAT DOG
AS SOON AS THAT JOB DISAPPEARED
SO WHEN WE TESTED BERTIE
YOU WOULDN'T REALLY EVEN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DOG AND A WOLF
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN GENES THAT WE HAVE SELECTED
FOR SIZE FOR EXAMPLE
SO THE ENTIRE THING OVER FIFTEEN
I'M NOT WORKING CLASS
I PUT ON MY BEST SMILE
WHEN I WAS A BOY
THAT WAS THE BRITISH EMPIRE
HE'S THE ONE THAT RUNS ABOUT IN SHORTS
HE WAS VERY UPSET
I DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN
THAT WOMAN WAS VERY OBSTTROPOLIS WITH MR GOLDBERG AND CAPTAIN PEACOCK
INDEED AND MY DEPARTMENT FEEL THE WHOLE CANTEEN STAFF IS INCOMPETENT
COOKING REQUIRES VERY LITTLE INTELLIGENCE
WE HAD TO THROW AWAY THE TIN
TO MY OWN TASTE
BUT YOU'LL NEVER SEE A DIRTY PLATE
IN MY KITCHEN AND IF THERE ARE ANY LEFTOVERS
ON THE OTHER HAND
ME AND MRS AXELBY DIDN'T FANCY GOING ABROAD THIS YEAR I MEAN
THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON ALL THE TIME
ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT
WHEN IT'S GOING TO RAIN
LIGHT ON A TOWEL TO DRY IN SOME SUNLIGHT
THIS MACHINE WILL SCANE YOU
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME
I'M NOT JUST TOUTING FOR BUSINESS
IT'S TWO HUNDRED POUNDS A WEEK
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING
I DON'T LIKE THOSE
ON APPROACHING THE CUSTOMER
TELL HUMPHRIES FIVE
IS SOMEBODY WHO UNFORTUNATELY HAS RENAL CANCER OR KIDNEY CANCER
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SHEDDING DIFFERENT ORGANIC COMPONENTS INTO THEIR URINE
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S PICKING UP
BUT IF WE CAN TRAIN DOGS TO DO THIS
AS OUR NEEDS HAVE EVOLVED
THEY HAD TO BE STEADY
YOU WALK UP STRAIGHT INTO IT
AND THAT IS A WOUND UP ABILITY TO BOUNCE AROUND AND HAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY
THAT IN TURN MEANS THAT THEY'RE WONDERFUL AS FAMILY DOGS
ALTHOUGH MANY OF US DON'T REALLY HUNT ANY MORE
THOSE RETRIEVING ABILITIES HAVEN'T GONE TO WASTE BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT RETRIEVERS ARE WONDERFUL
SHE'S ACTUALLY KATE'S DOG
SO UM FIRST AND FOREMOST
SHE WILL ALWAYS POSITION HERSELF
THEY WOULD LITERALLY TAKE A BULLET FOR YOU
AS IT TURNS OUT
AND THE SPEED OF THE GREYHOUND
AND HERE'S A CLIP OF AN ABSOLUTE CLASSIC EXAMPLE
AND THAT MAY SOUND BONKERS BUT IT'S TRUE
IT'S ALSO KIND OF INTELLIGENCE
NOT ONLY DISCRIMINATE SIMPLE COLOURS OR
I THINK THE THE RANGE STEMS FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL REWARD OF WANTING TO PLEASE PEOPLE
YOU CAN TRAIN VIRTUALLY ALL MAMMALS USING EXACTLY THE SAME TECHNIQUES
WE ATTEMPTED TO TEACH OUR PREVIOUSLY ILLITERATE DOGGIE STUDENTS TO RECOGNISE A RANGE OF WRITTEN
TESTED AND CHALLENGED OUR DOGS
AND WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED IS THAT DOGS ARE ASTONISHINGLY ADAPTABLE AND QUICK WITTED
TOGETHER WITH THEIR DESIRE TO BOND WITH US
AND ACCORDING TO THE KENNEL CLUB'S LATEST DATA
AND THEY CAN'T DO IT
SO I SUGGEST TO MY SUPERVISOR TO TEST IT ACROSS SPECIES
THAT WAS THE FIRST STUDY WHERE WE CHECKED WHETHER AN ANIMAL WOULD YAWN CONTAGIOUSLY WHEN
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ABOUT
AND MAYBE EVEN GRIEF
EVERY TIME HE WAS CHASED AWAY
WE COME BACK AGAIN
BUT THE PROVOST OF THE TOWN
THERE WAS ONE IN LIVERPOOL
VERY DEEP GROWL
AND SEE IF THEY CAN PICK THEM UP
AND HIS THEORY IS THAT DOG OWNER OR NOT
YOU COULD CERTAINLY IDENTIFY THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BARKS PLAYFUL
IT'S RATHER LIKE CHOOSING A ROMANTIC PARTNER
CAME OUT AS THE MOST EXTROVERT
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL HIM THAT I'VE GOT TWO VERY SCRUFFY MONGRELS
I'D BE VERY PLEASED
STILL OFFICIALLY A PUPPY
VERY SWEET NATURE
WE'VE GOT A TEST TO SEE HOW MUCH VARIATION THERE IS WITHIN A BREED
THEY'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAME
SOME WENT FOR ROAST CHICKEN OR FOOD
FROM LONDON SOUTH BANK UNIVERSITY
YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK
AND EVEN IF YOU DO HAVE ONE
AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY STARTLING
IT'S A TWO WAY STREET
WHEN WE MEASURE THE SAME HORMONE
WHEN WE INTERACT WITH THEM
IN THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURY
MADAM HAS ANNOA WHAT IS PURPLE WITH WHITE STRIPES
AND WHAT IS MORE
ONE JUST GETS BORED WITH STAYING IN THE SAME HOUSE
ACCORDING TO HER
AND TO COMPLICATE MATTERS FURTHER
SHE SAID IF IT WAS ALL RIGHT FOR HIM
THE LAST TIME WE MET
YOU DID SAY I WAS TO COME AND STAY
THE CLIP IS THE AERIAL
AND HAVING GOT THROUGH THAT
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL
AND THEN TO KEEP A LONG
AS FAR AS I KNOW
DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE TREATED WITH ANYTHING BUT RESPECT
WHO'S SHORTER THAN MY FRIEND
I'M LOOKING FOR BALANCE
ACTUAL AND VISUAL
THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE HEAVY
BROUGHT IT DOWN ONTO THIS STEM
IT'S LIMP HERE AT THE NECK
WE HAVE EMPATHY WITH THEM
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THE JUDGES
IF IT WAS BETWEEN JO AND AVRIL AND SHIRLEY AND VICTORIA
BUT IF YOU CAN'T THEN AFTERWARDS
DRINK WATER CHEW SUGAR FREEE GUM OR EVEN EAT A PIECE OF CHEESE
WITHOUT BEING RECOGNISED FOR MANY
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO GO HOME AND THERE'S NO RECOVERY PERIOD
WHAT ARE THE MAIN ISSUES WITH BRITAIN'S TEETH TODAY
BUT IT ALSO HAS SUGAR IN IT
YOU CAN STILL EAT THE CHIPS
YOU CAN ACTUALLY STOP TO BRUSH THE ENAMEL OFF
BECAUSE IT'S SOFTENED
I MEAN IT DOES TAKE
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CATCHING UP WITH HER AND FINDING OUT IF ANYTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE SHE HAD
WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE HER
THIS GUY IS ALREADY POINTED THAT DIRECTION AND AS SHE COMES UP
YOU SLOW DOWN FASTER
IF IT'S HOT AND LOW DENSITY
DOES NOT HAVE ANY ATMOSPHERE AND IT MAKES THE PROCESS OF GETTING DOWN TO THE SURFACE KIND OF SIMPLE
EVEN IF WE WANTED TO TALK TO CURIOSITY
TWO IT'S CALLED MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER AND MARS ODYSSEY
SO THESE ARE TWO ORBITERS THAT WE HAVE AROUND MARS ALREADY
I'M DOING WHAT THEY DID BEFORE AND IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING COMPLETELY NOVEL
SOMETIMES WE THINK IT'S CRAZY
SIX HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO
TAKE THE POWDER AND PUT IT INTO THE CHEMISTRY LABORATORY WHICH IS INSIDE THE ROVER
AND AND THAT I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT
IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT A GEOLOGIST WOULD DO ON EARTH
WE'VE GOT INSTRUMENTS THAT CAN PING THINGS DOWN IN THE SUBSURFACE AND TELL US IF THERE'S WATER DOWN
CAN WE DETECT THEM WITH SAM
AND IF THERE ARE
A HEALTHY RIVER
NAZI GERMANY WAS IN RUINS
AS FOR THE NATION
AND IT'S ABOUT THE BRITISH PEOPLE
THERE WERE GRAMOPHONE RECORDS AND
EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES
AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT
BUT IT WAS ALSO A REMARKABLE DAY FOR THE BBC
FOR THE FIRST TIME
WHO WERE DETERMINED TO PRESERVE THEIR MONOPOLY
AND EVEN THE BULLETINS THAT WERE BROADCAST WERE CULLED ALMOST ENTIRELY FROM THE WIRE SERVICES LIKE
SOON AFTER THE NAZIS CAME TO POWER IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE
HE SAID THAT THE NEW MEDIUM WAS
WHO SHOULD DECIDE
HOW MUCH SHOULD BE TOLD
WHICH HELD THE WHIP HAND
TWO COLLEAGUES AND
A FORMAL LETTER FROM THE WAR OFFICE
FOR THE BBC AND ITS CORRESPONDENT
HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO MAKE PHONE CALLS
NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE TOWN
HE WAS STIFLED BY THE CENSORS
SO HE SUGGESTED TO AN ARTILLERY BATTERY
AND THEY ROSE UP AS ONE TO DEMAND THAT REPORTS FROM THE FRONT BY THE BBC SHOULD ONLY BE
WHAT WAS OF FAR GREATER IMPORTANCE
THE PRESTIGE OF THE NATION AS A WHOLE
THE PRESS BACKED OFF
IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR
AND FOR A VERY GOOD REASON
THERE WERE CASUALTIES BUT
THE GERMANS ARE BROADCASTING IT
WE MUST AS WELL
IT PUT ITS OWN MEN INTO KEY POSITIONS WITHIN THE CORPORATION
HE SHOWED NO SIGN OF PRESSURE
AS A LEADING FASCIST
THEY GOT TO FRANCE AND WERE SOON ON THEIR WAY TO THE SAFETY OF GERMANY
THAT'S A PECULIAR PLACE TO BE GOING AT A TIME LIKE THIS
IT SEEMED TO SAY
AND THIS POSED SOMETHING OF A DILEMMA FOR THE BBC
HE WAS ARGUING FOR A FAIRER AND MORE EQUAL SOCIETY THAT HE THOUGHT WOULD BETTER UNITE THE
THE CHORUS WAS JOINED BY THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION
TO THE BBC'S DISMAY
ORDERED THAT HIS POSTSCRIPTS BE TAKEN OFF AIR
WHICH PROMPTED PRIESTLEY TO SAY THAT THE BBC WAS CONTROLLED BY THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION
WHICH IN TURN WAS CONTROLLED BY THE WAR CABINET
GARDNER FOUND HIMSELF HERE
ON THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER
BUT THE RAF WAS ON THE SCENE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
AND ONE GENERAL
IN THE HEIGHT OF THE BLITZ
WAITING TO PRESENT A NEW PROGRAMME
LONDON AFTER DARK
AS HE STARTED THE BROADCAST
FOR THE FIRST TIME
THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO HEAR SOMETHING OF THE REALITY OF WAR
THE DIRECTOR GENERAL
FOR SIX NIGHTS IN A ROW
HIS PLOY WORKED
ON THE SEVENTH NIGHT
RETORTING THAT HE WOULD NOT BE BROWBEATEN INTO A RETREAT TO THE SAFE REGIONS
HAD IT BEEN NUMBER TEN THAT WAS COMPLAINING
AND HE TENDED TO REGARD THE RUSSIAN NATION AS PEOPLED BY BARBARIANS
AH THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE BETWEEN STALIN AND HITLER WAS OVER
THEY WERE AT WAR WITH EACH OTHER
RATHER THAN ON THE REGIME WHICH RULED OVER THEM
URGING THE WORKERS TO RISE UP AGAINST THEIR CAPITALIST MASTERS
SENSING THAT THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT ALTOGETHER APPRECIATE THIS SUBVERSION ON THE AIRWAVES
THE FOUNDER OF THE PROMS
THEY WERE GIVING THE FIRST PERFORMANCE IN BRITAIN OF A NEW WORK BY THE RUSSIAN COMPOSER DMITRI
THE SCORE HAD BEEN FLOWN ACROSS IN THE DIPLOMATIC BAG
EVEN FORTY YEARS ON
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE BROADCASTER TO ESTABLISH A REPUTATION FOR TELLING THE TRUTH IN A
AMONG OTHER THINGS
WAS SUPPOSED TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE ENEMY
BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A BLATANT EXAMPLE OF UNWARRANTED AND SELFDESTRUCTIVE CENSORSHIP
DIEPPE SERVED TO MARK A TURNING POINT THAT WOULD TRANSFORM THE BBC'S COVERAGE OF THE WAR
THE LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S LOST THEIR MOVEMENT
COSY AND ENERGY EFFICIENT HOUSE
BECAUSE WE DON'T DO NINETY PERCENT
ANYTHING WOULD BE GREAT
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE HOLDS IT TOGETHER SOME DAYS
AH FULLY INTEND TO
WITH HER AND WITH JASON
MAKING MEMORIES FOR JASON
UM HE'S GOT SOMETHING TO LOOK AT
SHE LIKES
OR LOOKING FOR LOVE
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THE NEWS
NOT SPENDING TIME TELLING THE PEOPLE WE LOVE HOW WE FEEL ABOUT THEM
AND THAT IS IDEAL FOR GROWING ONIONS
ALL THE BETTER TO BEAT YOU WITH
WE'VE DONE OURSELVES PROUD
ON VALENTINE'S DAY
VIOLET CAME ALONG
ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE
WE WEREN'T SURE WHETHER THEY WERE GOING TO SURVIVE AS A COUPLE BECAUSE THE STRESS ON THEM HAS BEEN
I NEED TO MOTIVATE HIM TO TO PUT THE EFFORT IN
THERE'S THREE WEEKS
WE HAVEN'T GOT THE SUN OR THE SEA OR THE SAND
YOU'D THINK TO YOURSELF
AND THE FULL PRICE
IT'S JUST GOING TO BE
BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO WELL
IT'S NOT AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE
HE SAID DESPONDENTLY
NOW HE WENT ON THE OFFENSIVE
THOUSAND MEN INTO PORTUGAL
AND THE NEXT YEAR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
THERE THEY MET THEIR NEMESIS
NAPOLEON LATER SAID OF THAT WAR
AT THE VERY APEX OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS THERE CAN'T BE SUCH A THING AS GENUINE FRIENDSHIP
ESPECIALLY AMONGST RIVALS
HE WAS WELL PREPARED DIAMONDS HAD BEEN SOWN INTO THE LINING OF HIS CARRIAGE IN CASE OF HURRIED
AND THAT HIS TROOPS THEREFORE WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE THE FOOD NECESSARY AFTER THOSE THREE WEEKS
SOMETHING THAT WAS TO BECOME A TRAIT IN THE FUTURE
HAVING MISJUDGED THE RUSSIANS MILITARILY AT BORODINO
THOUSAND RUSSIANS WERE CONVERGING ON HIS ARMY OF FIFTY FIVE
HE HAD A RIVER TO HIS BACK
IF NAPOLEON SUCCEEDS IN GETTING US OUT OF THIS TODAY
BUT WOULD IT GIVE NAPOLEON ENOUGH TIME AND SPACE TO CREATE AN OPENING
FOUR HUNDRED DUTCH SAPPERS
WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF THE RETREAT FROM MOSCOW
TO ALL APPEARANCES
IT WAS BUSINESS AS USUAL
THE SHEER SCALE OF THE LOSSES IN RUSSIA WOULD HAVE FELLED MOST MILITARY LEADERS
WITHIN TWO MONTHS
THE CAVALRY HAD BEEN DECIMATED BY THE RETREAT FROM MOSCOW
COMING HERE REPRESENTED TOTAL VICTORY FOR THE RUSSIANS
ON THE TWENTIETH OF MARCH
DE NAPOLEON ARRIVED AT THE TUILEY AND WAS CARRIED UP THE STAIRS IN TRIUMPH
THE TRICOLOR FLEW OVER THE PALACE ONCE AGAIN AND SLOGANS STARTED APPEARING ON THE WALLS OF THE
DOWN WITH THE PRIESTS
IT WAS ALSO CLEAR THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DECISIVE BATTLE
WE SHALL EMERGE VICTORIOUS
CONCENTRATE TO FIGHT
NAPOLEON SENT MARSHAL GROCI OFF IN THAT DIRECTION WITH THIRTY
THOUSAND MEN AND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX GUNS
AND HE WAS GOING TO TRY TO BREAK THROUGH WELLINGTON'S LINE
AND WELLINGTON HAD SIXTY EIGHT
THIS WAS GOING TO BE A CLASSIC
THE IMPERIAL GUARD
ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS FARMHOUSE
BUT IT WAS A MUCH DEPLETED FORCE BECAUSE HE'D HAD TO SEND SO MANY MEN TO FIGHT OFF THE PRUSSIANS ON
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER
NAPOLEON HAD TRIED TO OUTFLANK AND ENVELOP HIS ENEMY
WRITTEN ABOUT IT
WHAT'S MUCH MORE INTERESTING IS WHY DIDN'T HE COMMIT SUICIDE
HE'D SPOKEN ABOUT SUICIDE
RATHER THAN THE CONTENT OF HIS CHARACTER
WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL'S WORTH WAS JUDGED ON HIS PARENTS' SOCIAL STATUS
IS INCREDIBLY UPSET THAT THEY'VE CUT DOWN THE TREES
WHO WORKS IN THE FORESTRY AROUND HERE
GIVE THEM TO THE LATHE MAN
THAT SAYS SO MUCH ABOUT THE GERMANS
YOU CAN SAY THEY'RE VERY
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD THINK OF A LOT OF GERMAN FOOD AS QUITE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
DO SOME NEW THINGS
AND YOU'VE GOT THE WARM
AND THEY STILL LIKE TO HAVE A DRINK AND EAT FOOD
SMITHY WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
TO CREATE THIS DISTILLERY AND THE AND THE WEALTH
WHO HAD NO CHILDREN
SO HE LEFT ALL HIS CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE TO HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND
THEY WANT LIGHT MEDITERRANEAN FOOD
I EAT WITH FINGERS
TOGETHER WITH MY SISTER
SPEAKING TO PEOPLE
AND NOT JUST SWEET
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES ON IN THAT GROWING PERIOD
IT'S GOING TO LOOK STANDARD
TOMORROW IS A BIG DAY
WE'VE GOT A CHALLENGE COMING UP WE ENJOY COMPETING IN
THIS IS THEIR CHANCE TO SHOW ME THE BREADTH OF THEIR SKILLS
THAT THEY'VE TAKEN ON BOARD EVERYTHING AND REALLY IMPRESS US
THE PRESENTATION IS VERY IMPORTANT TODAY
WE'VE GOT SO MANY HAPPY MEMORIES
DEFINES A WORKING LANDSCAPE
IT ALLOWS THE STOCK TO DRINK FROM NEARLY EVERY FIELD
AND I WAS THE ONLY NEW MEMBER THAT YEAR
IT WAS JUST ON THE VERGE OF SHUTTING DOWN
INSTEAD THEY'VE GOT PEOPLE ON BOARD
WILL COME UP IN THE WINGS
IT'S UP TO YOU EXACTLY HOW YOU INTERPRET THAT
BUT WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR ARE BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHS WHICH SHA THE HUGE SPECTRUM OF COLOURS
ONE FOR EACH MONTH
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN THE UK
WE NEED HARD COPIES
NOT EMAILED OR COMPUTER FILES
BUT WE CAN'T RETURN ANY OF THE ENTRIES
A STRANGE HALF LIGHT WHERE TWILIGHT AND DAWN MERGE
IT'S TURNING WHAT WAS A KIND OF WASTE PRODUCT INTO A SOURCE OF ENERGY
THIS ONE IS OUR MIDDLE WIRE
OVER EIGHT KILOMETERS OF WIRE
AND YOU SEE SO MUCH IN ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS
WHAT A WICKED WAY TO SEE THE LANDSCAPE AND TAKE IT ALL IN
SO PLEASE EMAIL US DETAILS OF YOUR SECRET BRITAIN
SO I HAD THE IDEA
AND SO THE CHORUS IS ALL ABOUT SINGING TO THE TIN FROM THE HUMAN PERSPECTIVE
THE CHURCH BELLS OF DARTMOOR THAT SING WITH MY VOICE
SO I LOVE TO THINK THAT ALL OVER DARTMOOR YOU CAN STILL HEAR THE RINGING OF THE TIN
AND IF YOU'RE UP FOR TAKING THE PLUNGE
SO SHOULD YOU BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND
I THINK THE WEATHER WILL HAVE IMPROVED A LONG TIME BEFORE THIS PLACE IS FINALLY SORTED
COMPLETING IN MOROCCO
IT DOES NEED A LOT OF WORK AND SOME INTERNAL RE JIGGING AS WELL
SO LET'S SEE WHO FANCIED THE CHALLENGE WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
THE PLOT ALONE IS A DESIRABLE COMMODITY
EVEN THOUGH IT FRONTS ON TO A BUSY MAIN ROAD
SHE WAS SO EXCITED
I WOULD RECOMMEND A FIGURE OF JUST UNDER THE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND
EXOUT TO BE PRECISE
SO WHAT WE'VE SAVED ON LABOUR
WHEN IT IS BUILT
THEY'VE MODERNISED IT
THEY'VE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB
THE CURRENT PROPERTY WOULD BE WORTH IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
SHOULD ANOTHER PROPERTY BE BUILT
SO I'M ON MY OWN
MUCH LIKE SHE WAS
JUST STICK FORWARD
DIVING FOR THE GROUND BECAUSE SHE WAS YOU KNOW AN AEROBATIC PILOT
SO I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY NATURAL JUST TO JAM THE STICK FORWARD
DID I REALLY GO THROUGH ALL THE CHECKS
WHICH I THINK IS AN ALSO AMAZING THING
I AM ACTUALLY TIRED
I'M NOT DOING IT
ALL EXCITEMENT COMPLETELY GONE
SO IS THERE ANYTHING TO GET AN ALTERNATIVE DRESS FROM ANOTHER BRIDAL SHOP
I'M NOT VERY I
WITH PRICES LOWER THAN THEY HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS
ON TODAY'S MARKET
MAYBE SORT OUT OFF STREET PARKING AND REJIG THE LAYOUT
SOLID FLOORS CAN GIVE YOU A PROBLEM
YOU DO WITH THIS YOU KEEP IT AS A ROOM LIKE THIS
IF I WAS GO TO RENT THE PLACE OUT
SO HOW WILL OUR POKER PLAYING CHUMS GET ON WITH THEIR FIRST COMMERCIAL VENTURE TOGETHER
WILL IT BE STRAIGHT FORWARD
WILL THEY END UP WITH A FULL HOUSE FULL OF PEOPLE HELPING THEM
YOU KNOW I GREW UP IN AN EDWARDIAN HOUSE JUST LIKE THIS
ONE THING YOU SHOULD KNOW IS THAT ONLY LAST YEAR
YOU'VE GOT THIS
WELL IT'S A THREE BEDROOM EDWARDIAN MID TERRACE PROPERTY WITH TWO RECEPTION ROOMS
THOUSAND GUIDE PRICE
SOME GREAT ORIGINAL FEATURES THERE LOTS OF WOODCHIP
AT THE END OF WHICH
WILL EMMA AND JIMMY SEE EYE TO EYE
SO WE'LL WE'LL BE SLIGHTLY OVER BUDGET
EVERYTHING'S GONE ON
THE IMPRESSION OF WHAT'S BEEN ACHIEVED IS VERY POSITIVE
MAYBE THERE'S SOME LIGHT AT THE END OF THE SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT TUNNEL FOR THIS PROPERTY
THINK THE OPTIONS FOR THIS PLACE ARE LIMITED
WHAT IS NEEDED IN THIS TOWN
WE THEN LOOK AT THAT LATER
THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL VENTURE
LATER IN THE SHOW
THOUSAND POUNDS ON THE RESALE
THAT INCLUDING THE STORE
I THINK WE JUST MAKE THIS SHOP A SUCCESS
QUITE A FEW GARDENS
SUCH A SMALL SPACE THERE
SO MANY IDEAS THAT WE CAN APPLY ON MUCH BIGGER SCALE
WHENEVER I'VE DONE THIS SORT OF THING
TAKE OUT ITS TENDRILS SO IT DEVOTES ALL ITS ENERGY TO PRODUCING THESE LONG
THEY ARE MOSTLY FROM SOUTH AFRICA
GARDENERS MORE AND MORE WANT TO GROW THESE UNUSUAL COLOURS
WE PLANT A SINGLE CROP IN A SINGLE SPACE
AND THIS IS A SERIES OF DIFFERENT CROPS GROWN TOGETHER ON THE SAME LAND
THE CONCEPTUAL GARDEN CATEGORY HAS BEEN HERE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX
AND THEY ARE ALL ABOUT PROVOKING THOUGHT
WE CAUGHT UP WITH THEM ON A BEACH IN EAST SUSSEX AS THEY MADE
THEY SHOULD INSPIRE US TO LIVE BETTER
AND I MIGHT HAVE A GO AT USING THAT BURGAMOT MARINADE ON A BARBECUE THIS WEEKEND
WE CERTAINLY GOT THE WEATHER FOR IT BUT REMEMBER
THEY MAY NOT BE VERY WELL KNOWN TODAY
BUT WHAT THEY STARTED HERE WENT ON TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE EARLY TRADE
ADD A LITTLE BREAKFAST BAR AREA AROUND THE FRONT
SO WHO WAS WANTING TO TAKE ON TROUBLE AT MILL WHEN THIS PROPERTY WENT UP FOR AUCTION
OF WHAT WE CAN DO INSIDE
BRICKS AND MORTAR
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT DAMP AND WHO IS RESPONSIBLE
THEN SHE CAN KICK BACK AND ENJOY THAT VIEW
ONCE SHE'S DECIDED WHAT COUNTY SHE LIVES IN
THIRD AND FINAL TIME AT FIFTY SEVEN
BUT COMING UP THE STAIRS INTO THIS ROOM
WE BOTH GOT BUTTERFLIES
IT'S GOT TONNES OF HISTORY
WE CAME AND SAW IT IN THE MORNING
WHAT IS NOT TO LIKE ABOUT THIS DUPLEX
AND ISN'T THERE A BIT OF A FUNNY STORY ABOUT ONE OF THE FLATS HERE THAT USED TO BE A PUB
AND THERE IS THAT DAMP TO THINK ABOUT
AND THE PROPERTY I'M HERE TO SEE SOUNDS APPEALING
BUT THAT GIVES THE PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER THE IDEAL OPPORTUNITY TO CARRY OUT
BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO CREATE AT LEAST A BIT OF USABLE KITCHEN SPACE
I DON'T THINK THIS WORKS
SO HERE IN THE BACK BEDROOM
DOING IT WITH A LOFT CONVERSION
AND WITH THE RENTAL MARKET
I THINK IT'S WORTH IT
IT'S A GOOD HOUSE IN A NICE LOCATION
ALL RESTING PROBABLY
I HAVE DONE IN SOME PROPERTIES LONG IN THE PAST
DAD DOING A GREAT JOB OF SETTING THE WHOLE FAMILY UP IN THE PROPERTY DEVELOPING WORLD
AND HOPEFULLY FORUM'S FIRST PROJECT WILL BE A SUCCESS
I'M SURE JIGGER WILL HELP MAKE THAT A REALITY
I'M JUST HELPING OUT SO
WHEN THE DAY AFTER THE AUCTION
UMM HAVING A BABY
WHEN IT WAS RAINING IN
AND THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH TRICKLE VENTS
IF WE WERE TO RENT THE PROPERTY
A HOUSE FOR THAT UM THAT KIND OF MONEY
IF WE WERE TO SELL THE PROPERTY
I WOULD VALUE THE PROPERTY AT ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND
IT BECOMES A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT
LET'S SEE WHO' SEEN THAT WHEN IT WENT TO AUCTION
I SAW ABOUT TWO OR THREE THAT WE WERE QUITE SERIOUS ABOUT
YOU MUST HAVE ACTUALLY
IT CAN BE DAUNTING
GROUND FLOOR FLAT WITH A GUIDE PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE UNTIL SHE CAN CALL IT HOME
APART FROM THAT
EASIER FOR MAINTENANCE
THE BUILDING OF THE EXTENSION TO THE REAR IS ALSO VERY GOOD TO THE PROPERTY
I LIKE VERY MUCH THE EXTENSION AT THE BACK WHERE THE KITCHEN TU IS
AND THEN ON THE INSIDE
I WOULD BE LOOKING TO PUT THIS PROPERTY ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE
NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS ASKING PRICE
VIEW YOUR PROPERTY
SO DID TODAY'S BUYERS DO THEIR HOMEWORK
BECAUSE THIS HOUSE HAS GOT THREE BEDROOMS AND IT HAD A GUIDE PRICE OF SIXTY
IF IT IS STILL AS A THREE BEDROOM
YOU WANT TO GO TO A CERTAIN LEVEL
AND IT WILL STILL SUIT THE NEEDS AND THE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT FAMILY
SO IN THAT SENSE
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS HOUSE BACK TO THE BARE BRICK
THAT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL BUDGET
EVERYTHING NEEDS DOING
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT SCARED OFF BY THE STATE OF THE PLACE AND YOU PAY NEAR THE GUIDE PRICE
THERE COULD BE ROOM FOR SOME PROFIT HERE
WHO ENDS UP GETTING THE HOUSE AND HOW WELL IT'S DONE
MICHAEL HAS A TEAM OF BUILDERS ALL READY TO GO
HE'S GOT A TENANT ALREADY LINED UP WAITING TO MOVE IN
WILL THEY STICK TO THEIR BUDGET
UM CERTAINLY NEEDS A LOT OF RENOVATION
ANYBODY ELSE CAN JOIN IN
I WOULD EXPECT THIS TO SELL AT AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE
THIRD AND FINAL TIME
THE PROPERTY'S LOCATION IS NOT IDEAL
RIGHT BY THE SIDE
WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT
THIS WELL USED TO PROVIDE THE WATER FOR THREE PROPERTIES AROUND HERE
THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK IT COULDN'T BE BROUGHT BACK INTO SERVICE
YOU'D PROBABLY HAVE TO PUT IN A PURIFICATION PLAN
THIS AREA OF CORNWALL
FAMOUS FOR ITS MINING IN THE PAST
SIX SEVEN BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS
UM SHOULD SELL IN THE REGION OF FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY
IF YOU WERE TO BUILD
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THIS PLACE ON
ON THE PLUS SIDE
THERE IS THE DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL ON THE PLOT
ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE
SO EVEN IF THERE WAS A COLLAPSE SITUATION
IT'S GOOD TO GUT A PLACE
YOU NEVER KNOW QUITE WHAT TO BID TO
BUT NOW THAT THE WORK'S BEEN DONE
ABOUT THREE AND A HALF MILES FROM THE NEAREST TOWN OF BELPA
AND BEFORE THAT
IT WON'T APPEAL TO EVERYBODY
DEFINITELY NEED TO GET THAT SORTED OUT
SO NOT A GOOD START
SO MOVE INTO WHILE I'M DOING THE WORK
NICE WINDOWS WITH A VIEW OUT THE FRONT
BECAUSE I'M HOME BASED
YOU CAN FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW
WE WOULD LOOK TO MARKET THE PROPERTY AT AN ASKING PRICE IN THE REGION OF THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE
IT WAS A BIT TIRED
I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFULLY PRESENTED
WE'VE KIND OF EARMARKED ABOUT FIVE
WE'RE GOING INTO WINTER SO THERE WILL BE BAD WEATHER AND THAT WILL DELAY THINGS
WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE IS HALF PORTUGUESE
THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE ROAD IS REALLY NOISY AND WHERE SHE IS IN
AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN THAT
THAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE BETTER THAN DOING THAT
WE NEEDED TO TWEAK SOME OF THE PLANS
MUCH UNDERRATED HEDGING PLANT AND TREE
IT'S NICE THAT WE CAN PICK THINGS FROM IT AND THEN WE CAN ACTUALLY
I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO US THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT
A LITTLE DETERMINATION
THERE ISN'T MUCH GROWING YET
SO IF THEY ARE TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL
WHEN YOU PLANT IT
YOU KNOW ON THE PLUS SIDE
FROM THE OUTSET
THE GARDEN HAS GROWN AND DEVELOPED AND THEIR VISION
SO IF YOU LIKE TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE
SO ARE OUR BUYERS TODAY ON A WINNING STREAK
WE KNOW WE'VE GOT A BIG PROJECT AHEAD OF US SO
WE DID KNOW THAT
UM MY MY WIFE'S PARENTS LIVE ABROAD
NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S ALREADY FULL PLANNING PERMISSION IN PLACE
THE CURRENT GARAGES WILL BE FLATTENED AND A DETACHED TWOBED HOUSE WILL BE BUILT
BUT IT WILL HAVE FOUR WALLS
IT WAS REALLY LAID OUT FOR MORE OF AN ELDERLY PERSON
I THE BATHROOM WAS ON THE GROUND FLOOR
IT'S ACTUALLY SEVEN
POINT THREE METRES WIDE AND THIRTY ONE METRES DEEP
UM I CAN'T LET HIM DOWN
HOW IS IT GOING TO WORK IF YOUR IF IF YOUR ACTUAL JOB STARTS GETTING BUSY
FORTUNATELY FOR US
YOU KNOW ABOUT IT SHOULD TIME RIGHT
I'M WORKING THAT WAY BUT
THEN COME BACK HERE IN THE AFTERNOON
BUT HIS BUSINESS IS BUILDING
IF WORK PICKS UP
WILL THIS PERSONAL PROJECT KEEP GETTING PUT ON HOLD
I REALLY FEEL THEY'VE MADE THE MOST OF THE SPACE WITH THESE PLANS
THAT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG
WE'VE GOT A HOUSE THAT WE'RE VERY VERY HAPPY WITH
I DON'T THINK WE'D WANT TO LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE
OUR SECOND ONE TURNED UP
SO ANOTHER GIRL
AND SHE'S NOW SEVEN
RATHER THAN A SHOWER
SO EVEN TOUCHING UP WAS BEING DONE EVEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
I SO PROBABLY CAME IN EIGHTY
BUT NOT IN THIS ONE
IDEAL FOR FIRST TIME BUYER
FATHER AND SON COMBINATION SEEMS TO BE WORKING WELL AND THEIR STRATEGY IS CERTAINLY ONE THAT IN THE LONG
HOW THEY GOING TO GET ON WITH THIS FLAT LITTLE
STAIRCASE IN FRONT OF YOU
I WOULD SUGGEST AN ASKING PRICE OF SIXTY NINE THOUSAND
FOR A RENTAL RETURN
THE OWNER HAS DONE EXACTLY WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO
AND IF YOURE UP FOR TAKING THE PLUNGE
WHY IS THAT A BENEFIT
SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INCOME OF ABOUT EIGHT
IT'S GOT BROAD APPEAL AND
IT'S SO CLOSE TO THE CITY CENTRE YOU CAN'T GO WRONG
THOUSAND WE THINK AT THE MOMENT
WITH FULL TIME JOBS
NOW THERE IS A CHALLENGE
YOU CAN FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH ALL THIS SPACE
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THESE OFFICES ARE JUST READY TO GO
PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE PROPERTY SO SORT OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
BEING REALLY PESSIMISTIC
IF WE CAN GET IT DONE FOR FOUR HUNDRED
TWO BEDROOM UNITS AT THE MOMENT PERHAPS FIVE FIFTY
CASH AS COMMERCIAL PREMISES
I'VE TALKED ABOUT DOING UP SOMETHING FOR A LONG TIME
IT IS A LOVELY PLACE TO LIVE
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO UNEARTH WHEN THEY START DIGGING AROUND
YOU CAN FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW
WE GAVE HIM THE ORIGINALS AND HE THEN SPLIT THEM UP INTO SEVEN FLATS
WHICH WAS A BIG RISK
THE VILLAGE IS A POPULAR VILLAGE
SO PROFESSIONAL COUPLES ARE GOING TO BE THE MAIN MARKETPLACE
WOULD FETCH SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIX HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS PER CALENDAR MONTH
HE'S JUST IN THE AMBULANCE NEXT TO ME
HAPPY AND HEALTHY
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
LOW BLOOD PRESSURE
IT'S A NO BRAINER
WHEN I MARRY YOU
SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE QUITE BIG
WOULD YOU CHOOSE MARK TO SETTLE DOWN MURY KELLY
THEY'RE ALWAYS DRESSING UP
BETH AND THE OUTLAW
AND HE KNOWS HE'S GOT TO GET IT RIGHT
WHICH IS VERY NICE
I DON'T CARE WHAT ELSE HAS DONE THROUGHOUT THE DAY
I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THIS NEXT FEW DAYS BECAUSE IF THIS CARRIES ON
TO GET THEM TO FIT
EVERYTHING WILL BE PERFECT
MAYBE A CHEDDAR CHEESE
NOT NORMALLY A TERM THAT'S APPLIED TO PROPERTY
BUT IT WAS IN THIS CASE
THIS PROPERTY CLEARLY HAS NOT BEEN TOED FOR A VERY
WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT
A PERSON WHO WAS VERY RESPONSIBLE
THOUSAND POUND SEVEN MONTHS AGO
THOUSAND POUNDS LESS THAN THE GUIDE PRICE
WHY IS SOMEBODY TURNING IT AROUND SO QUICK
ONCE THE MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT ON THE PROPERTY
A LONG TERM INVESTMENT
IT COULDN'T BE MORE CONVENIENT AND WHEN IT'S FINISHED
I'M SURE IT WILL BE A GOOD INVESTMENT PROPERTY
YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW HE GETS ON LATER IN THE SHOW
THE GUY PRICE JUST ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND
BO NOW IT'S JUST A FIVE MINUTE WALK FROM BOW ROAD TUBE AND THE BOW CHURCH DLR
WHICH IS FANTASTIC BECAUSE IT GETS YOU STRAIGHT INTO LONDON IN A MATTER OF MINUTES
NOW I'M HERE TO SEE THIS SECOND FLOOR FLAT
YOU COULD UE THIS
IT'S WELL WORTH THE MONEY
BECAUSE IN THIS FLAT
WHICH MEANS EVERY CHANGE YOU MAKE INSIDE AS WELL AS OUT NEEDS TO BE CLEARED WITH A CONSERVATION
I EXPECT TO SPEND FIFTEEN THOUSAND
WITH THE OLYMPICS ON THE HORIZON
MAYBE THEY'D BE BETTER OFF TO HANG ON TO THIS ONE
BECAUSE I RECKON PROPERTY PRICES WILL BE ON THE RISE AROUND HERE
I DON'T THINK THERE'LL BE A HUGE AMOUNT OF PROFIT IN THIS FLAT
THE ORIGINAL FEATURES HAVE BEEN KEPT
WHICH IS KEY WHICH IS KEY TO THE PROPERTY
IT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT PROPERTY TO SELL IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE
I WOULD RECOMMEND AT NINETY
AND THAT DAMAGE NOT ONLY CAUSED BY THE FIRE
OBVIOUSLY BEEN BUT MAYBE WHEN THE FIRE BRIGADE CAME TO PUT OUT THE FIRE
FLOODING THIS PLACE WITH WATER
DEFINITELY NOT ONE FOR THE UNWARY
WOULD BE A FANTASTIC RENTAL OPPORTUNITY OR A LOVELY PLACE TO LIVE
WITH A SMALL PROFIT
I THINK I CAN SEE ALL THE PROBLEMS I'M GOING TO ENCOUNTER AND I CAN TACKLE MOST OF THEM
IT'S A GOOD SIZE THREE BEDROOM WITH AN UPSTAIRS BATHROOM
I THINK THEY'VE DONE QUITE WELL BY OPENING UP
IT CERTAINLY LOOKS MUCH LARGER NOW
AH BUT WHEN WHEN TIME ALLOWS
BUT I STARTED OUT WITH A SETMO IN THE BANK OF TWENTY
SO IT'S AN EASY COMMUTE
BETTER ONES IN PERTH AND ALSO IN DUNDEE
AND YOU'VE JUST GOT TO BE SLIGHTLY WARY
BUT EVEN IF NOT
AND YOU NEVER KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO GO UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT
A POPULAR PART OF X
IF YOU TAKE THIS PLACE ON
FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW
IT'S A LARGE HOUSE IN A PRETTY GOOD LOCATION WITH LOTS OF OPTIONS
ONE THING'S FOR SURE
WITH THAT GUIDE PRICE OF ONLY TEN THOUSAND
I THINK THIS ONE MIGHT HAVE PULLED IN THE PUNTERS WHEN IT WENT TO AUCTION
WE WAS BEFORE WE WERE GOING TO BUY THIS PLACE
WHEN'S THE LAST VIEW YOU
I'M SELF EMPLOYED
WE ALREADY KNOW THE PARKING ISSUES MAY MAKE THAT A BUMPY ROAD TO TRAVEL DOWN
HAVE THEY TAKEN ON TOO MUCH
WILL THAT PUB SHINE ONCE AGAIN AS A MODERN FLAT DEVELOPMENT
PUBLIC HOUSES ARE CLOSING DOWN WITHIN THE VALLEYS
IT TAKES VISION
SOMEBODY HAD IT
WHAT DID THEY LOOK FOR
IT'S GOT EASY ACCESS TO THE ROADS
IT'S GOT YOU KNOW RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ALL AROUND IT
THEY MADE THE DECISION TO TRY AND GET PLANNING PERMISSION
THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD RENT OUT FOR ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE TO ONE HUNDRED POUNDS PER WEEK
ITUNES HADN'T EVEN BEEN ESTABLISHED THEN
SOLD THE HOUSE IN LA
I WOULD'VE LIKED IT MAYBE TWO
AND OTHER PEOPLE SAID THAT'S A REASONABLE
I'VE GOT THE PLANNING PERMISSION
I THINK IT WOULD BE WORTH ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY
LET'S SEE WHO WENT FOR IT WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
SOME OTHER BUILDERS
IT'S NICE AND EASY FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE
IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE PLOT
THE BATHROOM'S GREAT
THEN THE PETROL TANKERS WOULD CLOG UP THE ENTIRE BRITISH MOTORWAY NETWORK
BUT IT'S NOT A MOLE OR A RAT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
BUT IF YOU LOOK A LITTLE BIT CLOSER
YOU CAN SEE EVIDENCE EVERYWHERE OF A SUBTERRANEAN ASSAULT
WE NEVER HAD TO FIND OUT
ARE A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR RECENT HISTORY AND THEY DESERVE TO BE RESTORED
THE POWER STATION THAT'S BURIED DEEP INSIDE ELECTRIC MOUNTAIN HARNESSES WATER TO SOLVE THAT TRICKY
IT'S A FULL SIZED RAILWAY
BECAUSE THE ENGINEERS
WHEN BUILDING THIS
AREN'T STARTING WITH A BLANK CANVAS
IT'S CALLED CROSSRAIL AND
UNLIKE THE TUBE
RIGHT WHERE I'M STANDING
OF PRECISION AND ELEGANCE THAT MAKES THIS A TESTAMENT TO THE INGENUITY OF MODERN
THEY WERE TAKEN AFTER SUNDAY'S CHURCH SERVICE
THIRTEEN MILLION FAMILIES WILL LOSE AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS A YEAR THAT'S WHAT FINANCE
THE COUPLE WHO LAY IN THEIR CRASHED CAR FOR THREE DAYS BEFORE POLICE CAME TO HELP JOHN YUWELL DIED
BUT I'VE SEEN SMALLER HOUSES
A FEW ISSUES WITH THOSE CRACKS BUT
BUT STILL A GREAT ONE TO GO FOR
THE AUCTION CATALOGUE SAYS IT WOULD GIVE A POTENTIAL PURCHASER AN IDEAL OPPORTUNITY TO CARRY OUT
DAD AND BROTHER
BUT APART FROM THAT
THIS FLAT IS ALREADY SETTING ITSELF APART
LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW IN THE BEDROOM HERE
SO UM I THINK THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A BIT OF SPECIALIST WORK
TRASHING THE PLACE
JOHN AND DAWN HAVE PURCHASED PLENTY OF PROPERTIES IN THE PAST
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THESE PLACES ARE ENDEARINGLY POPULAR
PLUS ROUGHLY TWENTY SEVEN
ORIGINAL TWO BEDROOMS WITH A DISJOINTED BATHROOM
YOU HAVE A LOT OF SALT IN THE ATMOSPHERE
IT'S NOT WITHOUT ITS ISSUES
LET'S SEE WHO THAT WAS
I DON'T ALWAYS GET QUITE THIS EXCITED ABOUT FLATS
I HOPE THE WORKS DON'T ESCALATE AND COSTS DON'T SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL
THAT CAME TO SLIGHTLY OVER SIXTY ONE
NEW KITCHEN AND BATHROOM
DRAWN OUT PROCESS
SOMEBODY WITH IMAGINATION
THEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR DREAM PLACE IN THE COUNTRY
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PROPERTIES THAT SOMEBODY IS GOING TO COME ALONG AND FALL ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH
A LOT OF WORK TO DO
THREE BEDROOM CHARACTER PROPERTY IN THE VILLAGE OF LAMERTON
BECAUSE THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF THINGS
AFTER A LUCKY ESCAPE GETTING HIS MONEY OUT OF THE ICELANDIC BANKS
BUILDS BANKING ON THIS PROPERTY IN DEVON
MAYBE TWO OR THREE YEARS
AND AND IF YOUR DAD MOVED DOWN HERE
MOSTLY NEW BUILD
BUT HE HAS ALL THE CONTACTS
WITH THAT IN MIND
IT'S NOT TERRIBLY WIDE
PUTTING IN A FIREPLACE AND SOME NICE COVING AND STUFF
HOW ELSE COULD YOU THINK ABOUT IMPROVING THIS FLAT
I LOVE THESE TYPICAL NORTH LONDON STREETS
HAVE ONE HUGE KITCHEN
SO BOUGHT AT THE RIGHT PRICE
KNOW IT COULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
BECAUSE WHAT'S NEXT
ON A RAINY NIGHT
THE CEILING IS PROBABLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED
SO LET'S SEE WHO FANCIED PASTURES NEW WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
HE'S GOT TO KEEP A REAL TIGHT REIN ON WHAT HE SPENDS SORTING IT OUT
I COULDN'T SKIM THE CEILINGS
MORTGAGES ARE HARDER TO COME BY
I WOULD ESTIMATE A PRICE IN THE RATE OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE
I'M GOING TO DO IS TRY AND SELL IT INITIALLY FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND I'M GOING TO TRY FOR ABOUT ONE SEVENTY FIVE
A FIVE YEAR OLD TURNING OVER A STONE AND SEEING A SLUG
BUT IF YOU DO LOSE IT AND I IMAGINE THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER ATTRACTIONS THAT CAN MAKE DIVERTU
ON A CORAL REEF
THAT SURELY HAS TO BE ONE OF THE GREAT SENSATIONS
THAT IS TRUE OF MANY NATIVE CULTURES
AND THAT WAS JUST MIND BLOWING
GIVEN THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE
WE'VE BEEN ABLE
SECRETS OF THE UNITED STATES
YOU'RE REMINDED ABOUT WHAT AH WHAT A BLESSING IT IS
THAT'S WHEN YOU GOT COOPERATION
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY
FOR THIS GENERATION
THAT THE UNITED NATIONS TELLS US THAT OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE HUMAN POPULATION
WHICH MEANS THAT
SOME PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY CUT OFF
THEY DO NOT DISPUTE
CERTAINLY THE LETTERS I GET
AND PEOPLE DO FEEL THAT
HAVE TO BE GLOBAL
AND THAT HAS BEEN THE HUGE ENCOURAGEMENT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS
IMPORTANT NATIONS HAVE ACTUALLY AGREED TO TAKE THESE STEPS
BUT THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED
EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED DEVELOPERS CAN MAKE MISTAKES
YOU'VE GOT THESE BEAUTIFUL PLANTS
IT'S GOING TO BE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
WHAT IS THERE NOT TO LOVE ABOUT THIS PLACE
A FEW ISSUES ABOUT FINANCING IT
BUT FANTASTIC LOCATION
CHARM BY THE BUCKET LOAD
VIRTUALLY OVER A WEEKEND
AND ALL A BIT RANDOM BUT
SOME CHALLENGES AHEAD
BUT WHAT A FANTASTIC PLACE TO OWN
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT SHE DOES WITH IT
SO YOU'RE LIKELY TO HAVE SERVICES NEARBY
THAT KIND OF STUFF
IT DOESN'T HAVE PLANNING PERMISSION AS YET
FIRST TIME BUYERS ARE FINDING IT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT
EVEN IF YOU BUILT THE MAXIMUM TEN PROPERTIES
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS THAT THOSE PROPERTIES DON'T SELL AND NO DEVELOPER WANTS THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO GO ON
IN THE ABSENCE OF TURRETS AND A MOAT
THE GUIDE PRICE THIRTY FIVE
BUT THEY'RE OFTEN THE ONES THAT WILL BRING YOU IN A FABULOUS RENTAL YIELD
BUY THIS ONE FOR THE GUIDE PRICE OF THIRTY FIVE
AND THAT IS REALLY
EASY LITTLE INVESTMENT
IT MIGHT NEVER MAKE YOU THE BIG BUCKS
IT'S VERY EASY TO GET PLACES FROM HERE
NOT TOO BAD BECAUSE
IN MY ESTIMATION
SO WE'RE TALKING FORTY TWO
THE BIGGEST THING
DO YOU BOTH ENJOY DOING THIS
IT HAS ITS MOMENTS
I STILL THINK IT'S A GREAT BUY
FIND OUT HOW IT ALL GOES
LATER IN THE SHOW
THE NEXT STAGE IS JUST AS IMPORTANT
FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AND WITH A VIEW TO ACHIEVING A SALE PRICE OF SEVENTY
THE BIGGEST THING
DOING THE WINDOWS
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE A FEW DESIGN DISCUSSIONS
AND THEN IT GOT INTO THE WINTER
SO WE JUST LOCKED THEM UP FOR THE TIME BEING
THEN THEY PROBABLY ARE A BIT SNOBBY AND EVERYBODY LOVES A BIT OF WINE CHAT
NOT LEAST MYSELF
FOR HIM IS THE FACT THAT HE'S HIT HIS HEAD
SHE'S BEEN UP AND ABOUT AND I THINK SHE'S GOING TO GO HOME ON FRIDAY
SO THAT'S GREAT
PROPERTIES CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S FORTUNE FOR BETTER AND WORSE
THIS IS ACTUALLY BUSHY PARK
WHY IS THIS PROPERTY THE PRICE THAT IT IS
WHEN YOU COULD GET SOMETHING SIMILAR IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY FOR
EASY COMMUTER DISTANCE
WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT
IT COULD BE WORTH UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND
SIMILAR PROPERTIES IN THIS STREET HAVE SOLD FOR A LOT MORE
BRICK BUILT HOUSE
THEY WERE OWNED BY AMERICAN SERVICE PEOPLE
THIS IS THE LAST ONE THAT WENT UP FOR AUCTION
I GOT A CALL FROM UM
PUT IT THAT WAY
AND IT LOOKS LIKE A REALLY GOOD BUY
OUT INTO THE GARDEN THERE
OR MAYBE JUST A CONSERVATORY
IT JUST CARRIES ON THAT THEME OF
IF IT'S MADE OF WOOD
ALTHOUGH HE DID BREAK THE CARDINAL RULE AND NOT LOOK AT THIS PLACE BEFORE HE BOUGHT IT
WILL IT REALLY BE OK INSIDE
AND THAT TIMESCALE SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS WELL
HE'S GOT A BABY ON THE WAY
AND THEN AFTER THAT
IT WAS LITERALLY FILM CREW'S HERE TUESDAY
IT'S A CASE OF THAT HAS TO BE DONE
AND YOU GET A REALLY GOOD FEEL
IT LOOKS REALLY INVITING ALL CLEAN
IT'S MY LUCKY DAY
LEFT AGAIN THROUGH THE SECOND SHOP ENTRANCE
AND INTO THE SECOND SHOP UNIT
FROM THE OUTSIDE
TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE FOR THE THIRD AND FINAL TIME
WE'RE GOING FOR QUALITY
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT
THIS BUILDING NEEDS A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SERIOUS PROFIT FROM PROPERTY
TIMING IS CRUCIAL
AND ALSO PLANS PASSED TO BUILD A COMPLETELY SEPARATE PENTHOUSE ON TOP OF THE BUILDING
WHICH I THINK WILL REALLY BE AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC APARTMENT
SO I WOULD BE IMAGINING THE PRICE AT THE MOMENT OF THE ONE BEDROOMS WOULD BE AROUND ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND
THE TWO BEDROOM FLATS WOULD BE IN TERMS OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY
I THINK THE PENTHOUSE
DEPENDENT ON HOW SPECIAL IT ACTUALLY IS
COULD BE UP TO TWO HUNDRED
IT WAS VERY DARK
AND IT'S ALSO GOT THE BENEFIT OF LOWER MAINTENANCE THAN TIMBER
THEY MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER OFFERS UPON THAT FIGURE
THE PRICE WOULD REMAIN AT SIXTY FIVE
IT'S AROUND THE FIGURE I EXPECTED
THEY HAVE EITHER A BEDROOM OR AH OR A PLAYROOM
THESE WERE VERY MUCH A MINORITY OF ISSUES
CONRAD AND I DO INTEND TO BE VERY MUCH INVOLVED DAY TO DAY
BECAUSE WE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S WORKING OPERATIONALLY PERFECTLY
WE HAVE SOME BEEF
IT'S JUST SUCH A CLASSIC PAIRING
IT'S LIKE FISH AND CHIPS
AS WE GET OLDER
SO HOW DO YOU DO IT
THEN IT DOES IN FACT CONTAIN GINKGO OR MILK THISTLE
BUT IS THAT ALWAYS THE CASE
HERBAL PRODUCTS ARE DIVIDED INTO CATEGORIES BASED ON THE HEALTH CLAIMS THAT ARE MADE
IF A MANUFACTURER MAKES A SPECIFIC HEALTH CLAIM FOR EXAMPLE
PRODUCTS WITHOUT THE TH O SYMBOL AREN'T ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY SPECIFIC HEALTH CLAIMS
THERE IS IN FACT NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT MILK THISTLE DOES AND IT'S SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT
IT'S MAYBE EVEN MORE WORRYING THAT THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING ELSE IN THAT WE ALSO DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
IF I LOOK AT ALL THESE PACKS ON THIS TABLE
THEY'RE ALL VERY CLEAR
THEY HAVE INGREDIENTS
THEY HAVE A DOSAGE
I'M SORRY TO SAY
IT'S A MARK THAT THEY'VE BEEN CHECKED AND THEY DON'T CONTAIN ANYTHING THEY SHOULDN'T AND THEY DO CONTAIN
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE HARDEST CASES I'VE TREATED OF WAX HAVE BEEN
PUSHES THE BLOOD AROUND YOUR BODY
ESPECIALLY IN YOUR LEG
WITH NO SMELLS IN THE AIR
WE ARE GOING TO SWITCH THIS ON
INSTEAD OF SUBJECTING PATIENTS TO INVASIVE AND RISKY SURGERY
DOCTORS HERE ARE ATTEMPTING TO REGENERATE DISCS FROM WITHIN USING AN
SO REMOVING THE DISC
YOU WILL PROBABLY NEED SURGERY
WHICH CARRIES RISKS
BUT IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE
SOMETHING'S GOING ON HERE
AND HAVING THAT JUST DRIVING PAIN
WHICH SAID THAT BEING OVERWEIGHT PROTECTS AGAINST DEMENTIA
SO WE COMMISSIONED A POLL OF TWO
I CAN STILL DO ALL THE THINGS I'M DOING BUT
THEN YOU WOULD BE LOOKING AT
IS THAT SOCIAL INTERACTION
UM SO AGAIN THAT'S
I THINK IF YOU MANAGE YOUR DIABETES WELL
YEAH WHICH IS A CUP OF COFFEE
FOR YOUR BRAIN HEALTH
BUT INCREASING THEIR ACTIVITY LEVELS AND CHALLENGING THEIR MINDS IN WAYS THAT BARELY COST
OBVIOUSLY THOUGHT ABOUT ME AN AWFUL LOT IN THAT CASE
THINGS LIKE THAT
THEN I'LL START TO STRESS OUT
THAT THEY WERE STILL TOGETHER AND WE HAD THAT NORMAL FAMILY LIFE
GRASP WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
AND IT COULD BE A REALLY
REALLY GOOD DAY FOR EVERYONE TO
SHE WILL NOT BE WEARING IT
IF ANYTHING'S TOO ON SHOW OR I DON'T FEEL HAPPY WITH SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO PUT THE DRESS ON AND LOVE IT
THE FLOWER GIRLS
THE THEME AS WELL
WANTED ME TO CHANGE THE DRESS
AND STARTS OFF PRETTY GOOD
WASN'T EXPECTING THAT
AH TWO PRETTY GOOD SIZED BEDROOMS
IT'S A REALLY NICE FLAT WITH A REALLY GOOD FEEL SO I'M SURE IT WAS A POPULAR LOT WHEN IT WENT UNDER
I THINK IT'LL BE REALLY FUN WHEN IT'S ALL DONE UP
READY TO MOVE INTO
I WOULD SUGGEST AN ASKING PRICE OF SIXTY
YOU MAY NEED A NEW BATHROOM
WE COULD DO THIS ONE IN TEN DAYS
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BECAUSE WE HAVE ANOTHER PROJECT GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME
I WAS TIME RICH
UM BEEN MOVING THINGS IN
THEY'RE KEEN TO GET RID OF ME
YOU HAVE A BEFORE AND AN AFTER BIT
MUCH OF THE SAME
THIS COULD BE AN INSTANT RENTER
FOR WHATEVER REASON
MAY HAVE BEEN OVERPRICED
I THINK IT WOULD BE A SLIGHTLY FRUSTRATING PROPERTY
YOU'VE GOT ONE SMALLISH LIVING ROOM
YOUR PRICE IS AFFECTED
I THINK TAJ HAS LANDED ON HIS FEET WITH THIS NEWLY DECORATED PROPERTY AND WITH OVER AN EIGHT
IT COULD PROVE TO BE A WINNER
ALL SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE TO ME
LET'S HOPE THERE ARE NO NASTY SURPRISES FURTHER DOWN THE LINE
WHEN THE HAMMER WENT DOWN AND IT WAS YOURS
DID YOU READ THE LEGAL PACK
DID YOU GET A SURVEY DONE
IT'S MUCH BETTER TO HAVE THE THREE ROOMS UPSTAIRS
I'D SAY IT WAS WORTH FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE POUNDS PER CALENDAR MONTH
WE HAVE TO WAIT TO MORTGAGE ONE PROPERTY BEFORE WE GO AND BUY THE NEXT
THATS QUITE A SLOW PROCESS
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO BECOME BOTH CASH RICH AND TIME
IT HAS A GROUND FLOOR BATHROOM
WHICH CAN PUT SOME PEOPLE OFF
THE RENTAL FIGURES
THE ATMOSPHERE IS ELECTRIC AND THE ACTION
IT'S FAST AND IT'S FURIOUS
EITHER SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO MAKE LIGHT INDUSTRIAL
GIVEN THE LOCATION
THE NUMBERS REALLY DO START TO STACK UP
ONE ONE LAST GLANCE
WHATEVER WORKS OUT
YOU'VE GOT THIS LARGE PLOT
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR IT
WHAT A SURPRISING TURN UP FOR THIS STORY
WE WOULD PUT THE PROPERTY OR MARKET AT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
ONE COULD RENT THE PROPERTY FOR AROUND THIRTY
THIS TWO BEDROOM HOUSE DOES NEED A LOT OF UPDATING AND THERE ARE A FEW MORE STRUCTURAL OPTIONS TO
AND THEN YOU COULD EXTEND OVER THE SIDE RETURN TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THAT KITCHEN
AND THESE TWO ROOMS WOULD BE REALLY SMALL
I WAS THINKING ABOUT A FLAT BUT I WAS A LITTLE BIT PUT OFF BY THE SERVICE CHARGES
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
AND I'M ACTUALLY THINKING THAT I PLAN TO LET THIS OUT
AND IF I START INCREASING THE COSTS THAT'LL CHANGE THE PROFIT MARGINS FOR ME
I'M PROBABLY NOT GOING TO MAKE HUGE STRUCTURAL CHANGES
THE ROOF IS THE IS STILL THE ORIGINAL ROOF
I JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THINGS ARE WORKING AND FUNCTIONAL
THIS ONE CAME ALONG
ALTHOUGH HE IS GOING TO HAVE A RATHER HANDS OFF APPROACH HERE
HE'S BOUGHT SENSIBLY
IN AN AREA THAT HE KNOWS
BUT WILL THIS IT CONSULTANT MANAGE TO KEEP A TAB ON THE OPTIMISTIC SIX TO EIGHT
YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW HE GETS ON LATER IN THE PROGRAMME
POTENTIALLY AS HOLIDAY LETS
SO THAT'S A REASONABLE
WE COULD ASK AROUND TWO HUNDRED
AND DEPENDING WHAT ABBY SAYS
MAYBE MAYBE I WON'T BE ALLOWED TO THINK ABOUT THE NEXT PROJECT
BELIEVE IT OR NOT
THE GUARD PRICE WAS NINETY NINE
SO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AROUND TEN TO FIFTY POUND PER FOOT JUST TO RESTORE THAT
THIS ROOM ALONE
IT DOES MAKE BRILLIANT SENSE
AND I THINK SHE HAS WILDLY UNDERESTIMATED THE BUDGET
BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY DONE ONE HERE
I'VE I'VE ALREADY GOT ALL THE LOCAL TRADES
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST
I THINK IT WILL BE
HAVE THOSE PROPERTY GAMBLES PAID OFF
I'M QUITE HAPPY WITH MY DAY JOB
I THINK I HAD AH HAD A GREAT TEAM THAT WERE REALLY HELPFUL
PROBABLY HOPING FOR ABOUT FIVE TO SIX WEEKS
THINGS TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN EXPECTED
SO I THINK WE'VE PROBABLY JUST GOT A FEW DAYS WORTH OF WORK LEFT
SO I ARREST
SO FOR EXAMPLE THE BOX ROOM UPSTAIRS
AND POSSIBLY PUTTING A CONSERVATORY IN THE GARDEN
THIS IS GOING TO BE LIKE SECRET GARDEN TYPE OF THING
THOUSAND AT THE MOMENT
AND WE'RE NO MORE THAN TWO HOURS AWAY FROM MY FAMILY IN NEWCASTLE
FROM A POSITIVE SENSE
REALLY REALLY DO TRUST HIM
THE LAST TIME WE WERE HERE
BUT I LOVE THEM
IS IT OUTDOOR STUFF
I HAVE A STAMP COLLECTION
I DO A LOT OF READING
I ENJOY WATCHING MOVIES
AND PERHAPS IN FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW
WE'LL HAVE THOSE KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE
AND THE LONGER THE MISSION
AND THE AND THE FARTHER AWAY WE GO
CONFUSED BY THE TECHNOLOGIES ON STAR TREK
YOU HAVE A HYDROGEN TANK
I HAVE A STAMP COLLECTION
I DO A LOT OF READING
I ENJOY WATCHING MOVIES
I CLIMB MOUNTAINS
LOTS OF OUTDOOR STUFF
BUT THINK ABOUT A MISSION TO MARS
HOW DO WE DETECT IT
IN SOME AREAS MEN HAVE A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE
IT'S ONLY SLOWING IN ONE HUNDRED
THREE HUNDRED THOUSANDTHS OF A SECOND SO IT'S ALMOST NOT VISIBLE TO A HUMAN
BECAUSE NOW WE KNOW YOUR EMOTION
AND WE KNOW IF YOU'RE TIRED OR FATIGUED FROM INADEQUATE SLEEP
BETTER TO HAVE A MACHINE DO IT
THEN IT FEEDS IT BACK IN AGGREGATE
GIVE ME THAT SECTION OF THE MISSION RIGHT HERE
AND GIVE ME THIS ASTRONAUT
AND LET WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
SO FOR A FIVE HUNDRED DAY MISSION
THAT'S A TON OF WATER
THAT'S FOUR TONS OF WATER YOU'D HAVE TO BRING WITH YOU
ONE IS THERE IS WATER IN THAT SOLID WASTE THAT WE'D LIKE TO EXTRACT
IT'S ALREADY ON THE TRAJECTORY THAT WE'RE ON
SO YOU REALLY WANT TO KEEP ALL THAT STUFF AWAY FROM THE SPACECRAFT AND MAKE GOOD USE OF THIS
BUT EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T BOTHER TO EXTRACT THAT WATER OUT
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH BAGS OF SOLID HUMAN WASTE FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
YOU'VE GOT TO STABILIZE IT SOMEHOW
IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE
LIFE ON EARTH AND HOW WE WERE ABLE TO EVOLVE IS THAT WE'RE PROTECTED FROM THE RADIATION OF GALACTIC
WE'RE TRYING TO USE WATER BUT WE'RE TRYING TO USE ITEMS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ON BOARD THE
IT'S TOO EARLY IN ANY OF OUR RESEARCH PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO TO SPECULATE ON THAT
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A THEORETICAL POSSIBILITY
WHAT THAT MEANS IS
IT'S THE SAME SHAPE IT WAS BEFORE
IT'S PACKED AT THE SAME DENSITIES OF SPACECRAFT
BUT I'M GOING TO PUT TWO CURIOSITIES
IN OUR MODERN SOCIETY
I BELIEVE THAT WE COULD GET THERE WITHIN A DECADE
SO ONE POLITICAL PERSON IN ONE COUNTRY ISN'T GOING TO DRIVE THE WHOLE THING
WHERE THIS SERIES
SOMETIMES TOTALLY CONTRADICTING WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IN THE PAST
WE CAN END UP SPENDING AS MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT OUR FOOD
DRINKS AND INGREDIENTS THAT HAVE MADE THE HEADLINES OR CAUSED CONTROVERSY
MAYBE EVEN LONGER
SEARCHING AMONGST ALL THE APPLES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BLEMISHES OR BRUISES
HOPING THAT THEY'LL STAY FRESH THAT LITTLE BIT LONGER IN THE FRUIT BOWL AT HOME
WHAT WE THOUGHT WE' DO IS TO TAKE SOME OF THE PRODUCE THAT JANET HAS GROWN REALLY NATURALLY
ALONGSIDE THE EQUIVALENT FROM A SUPERMARKET AND WE'VE TEST IT ALL FOR PESTICIDE RESIDUE
LIKE A DRINK OR TWO
EVEN PERHAPS JUST OCCASIONALLY
AND WHILE YOU MAY WELL CONSIDER HOW MANY UNITS OF ALCOHOL THERE ARE IN YOUR FAVOURITE TIPPLE
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM
LET'S BE HONEST
IF YOU OPEN YOUR KITCHEN CUPBOARD AND HAVE A GOOD OLD RUMMAGE
WE'VE FOUND A LARDER THAT'S POSITIVELY BURSTING WITH DRIED HERBS THAT SEEM WELL PAST THEIR BEST
I WOULD USE MY SMELL
MY COMMON SENSE
LET'S TALK ENERGY DRINKS
THEY BOAST EXOTIC SOUNDING INGREDIENTS LIKE GUARANA OR TAURINE
THEY PROMISE TO MAKE YOU MORE ALERT
TO INCREASE CONCENTRATION AND
TO BOOST YOUR ENERGY
TOOK THE DRINKS AWAY AND GAVE THEM BACK AT THE END OF THE DAY AND NOW
IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE US TO INVESTIGATE
IT ISN'T ALWAYS EASY TO GET THE WHOLE PICTURE ABOUT THE FOODS THAT WE EAT
THE ONE THAT SURPRISED ME PROBABLY MOST OF ALL WAS THE TEST THAT WE DID ON THOSE PESTICIDES
BECAUSE WE'VE BECOME SO USED TO PEOPLE TELLING US THAT SUPERMARKET FRUIT AND VEGETABLE IS ABSOLUTELY
THIS IS A SUBJECT THAT IS DEAR TO MY OWN HEART BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I'M AT HIGH RISK
SO I DECIDED TO TAKE PART IN A BIG EXPERIMENT WE'RE DOING HERE IN LONDON
I HAVE COVERED A HUGE RANGE OF SUBJECTS
I HAVE WRESTLED WITH THE CHOLESTEROL CONUNDRUM
THEY LOWER CHOLESTEROL AND THEY ALSO REDUCE YOUR RISK OF HAVING HEART ATTACK
YOUR TOTAL CHOLESTEROL SHOULD BE LESS THAN FIVE
SHOULD BE LESS THAN THREE
AND YOUR GOOD CHOLESTEROL
SHOULD BE MORE THAN ONE
THE MUSCLES IN YOUR THROAT AND NECK RELAX AND GO FLOPPY
THIS MAKES THE AIRWAYS NARROW
AS SURGEON GABRIEL WESTON HAS BEEN FINDING OUT
THE DIET I'M ABOUT TO GO ON WAS DEVELOPED BY A NUTRITIONIST IN TORONTO AND IT'S CALLED A PORTFOLIO
AND IF YOU SEE IT
IF YOU FOLLOW THESE PIECES OF ADVICE
BUT NINETY PERCENT EFFECTIVE AGAINST A LIFE THREATENING CONDITION
IT'S LIKELY THAT IT WON'T TELL YOU WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR HEALTH
HEART DISEASE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE UK
IF YOU SEE SOME STAIRS AND YOU HAVE TO GO UP THREE FLOORS
AND IF IT'S HIGH
GET YOUR BAD CHOLESTEROL DOWN
BUT CAN YOU DO IT BY MODIFYING YOUR DIET
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT
SO THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING IN THE MEDICAL FIELD ARE ACTUALLY HAVING A BENEFIT
MORE SO THAN MANY OTHER PARTS OF MEDICINE
ABOUT WHAT WORKS IN TERMS OF PREVENTING HEART DISEASE
LOWERING BLOOD PRESSURE ALSO HELPS
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL
WE LOVE THE IDEA THAT A BIT OF RED WINE IS PROBABLY GOOD FOR US
AND WE'RE COMING FROM YORK
SURROUNDED BY LOTS OF CHOCOLATE
I THINK THAT'S CRAZY
THAT'S WITHIN BUDGET
AND ALL THE FAMILY
WATCH THIS SPACE
THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY TO DO A FILM PREMIERE
ARE WE DOING THE RIGHT THING
IS MUM DOING THE RIGHT THING
I DON'T KNOW THIS WOMAN
IF HE WALKED HERE NOW AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING I'M NOT
I'M NOT GETTING MARRIED AT THE OLD
I'M JEREMY AND I'M A SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER MANAGER
AND I'M A BUSINESS ANALYST FROM WORCESTER
THE SHOW THAT PUTS YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND YOUR PERSONALITY TO THE TEST
I'M A LIFE CAR FROM LIVERPOOL
WE'LL BE PLAYING FOR THREE
HERRING AND BENEDICTINE LIQUEUR
WHY WOULD WE BE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS
THE NATIONAL TRUST BATTLED TO KEEP PLASNA WARM AND DRY BY GUZZLING UP TO
SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS
THE APPETITE IS THERE
FISHY CLOTHES FOR TEN DAYS
WE ENJOY OUR TIME
THIS TIME KILLING THIRTY FIVE PEOPLE
I UNDERSTAND CAMOUFLAGE ON THE LAND
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO COASTAL CAMOUFLAGE
SO WHY NOT DO THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE
MY NAME IS R
I'M A SOCIAL CARE MANAGER
AND I'M FROM BARNET
I'M AN OPERATIONS MANAGER FROM MAIDENHEAD
I DON'T LIKE IT MYSELF
YOU ALL GET THE SAME QUESTION WRONG
I WASN'T A TEACHER'S PET
THEY KNOW MY NAME
AH GOING FOR A COFFEE NOW
YOUR TIME WILL END IMMEDIATELY
I'VE BEEN WITH MY HUSBAND FOR SO LONG
THEY WEREN'T INVENTED BACK IN THOSE DAYS
AND ONLY THE FIRST QUESTION
IF YOU GET THAT RIGHT
AND IF YOU DO THAT
THAT'S HOW MUCH HAARDS SAY PROBLEMS CROSSING THE CHANNEL ARE COSTING THEM
THE MIGRANT CRISIS IN CALAIS AND FRENCH STRIKE ACTION HAVE TURNED SOME ROADS INTO A LORRY PARK
ABUSE ON A MASSIVE SCALE
TODAY SIX MEN WERE CONVICTED FOR THEIR PART
IT'S THE FIRST VISIT TO THE COUNTRY BY A US PRESIDENT
HE TOLD THE BBC HE'S DETERMINED AMERICA SHOULD SUPPORT AFRICAN NATIONS BATTLING ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS
FIND OUT WHY AND
SHIFTING A HOUSE
SO I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO STATIC FOR TOO LONG
SCARS STILL QUITE LITTLE BUT I THINK THEY
ARE WE TALKING GITES
WHERE AN AVERAGE THREE BEDROOM DETACHED HOUSE COSTS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY
LET'S MEET THEM AND FIND OUT
THE TRANSITION FOR A FAMILY
IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN THE UK
THAT SPLENDID FARMHOUSE WITH READYM MADE JETE
THE FACT THAT IT WAS A HOME AND BUSINESS IN ONE
WELL UNDER THEIR BUDGET
YESTERDAY'S PROPERTY WAS A RURAL RETREAT
I GOT THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION THAT THEIR PLANS FOR THIS MOVE WERE FLUID
TO SAY THE LEAST
BUT AFTER SHOWING THEM OUR FIRST PROPERTY
IT'S GOT CHARACTER
I'M STILL NOT SURE WHETHER WE HAVE FOUND THEM THAT PERFECT FRENCH HOME OR NOT
PLUS A FEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES THROWN IN FOR WAY UNDER THEIR BUDGET
I THINK HE'S MADE ME REALISE THAT WE CAN'T DO A HALFHEARTED JOB IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BEACH
AND SO SHE DOES NEED IT FOR HER PRACTICE
IT'S A VERY SMALL BUDGET
I WOULD LIKE TO GET IT RIGHT FIRST TIME
BECAUSE I THINK OVER THE SIX YEARS THAT WE'VE LIVED HERE
BUT THE IDEA IS THERE
YOU I LIKE THAT SORT OF INITIAL WOW FACTOR
I DON'T REALLY HAVE THE PATIENCE FOR THINGS TO
BECAUSE OF THE VERY PARTICULAR CONDITIONS BY THE SEA
ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO SAY IF I'VE BEEN ORGANISING THIS
BUT I'M A LITTLE LESS IMPRESSED ABOUT THE IMPATIENCE WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL GARDENING AND I DO
IT WAS JUST REALLY CONSTRUCTIVE AND REALLY HELPFUL
MAKING US THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WERE PUTTING WHERE
HARDLY A YARD AND AN OLD BUILDING
BUT THEY DID HAVE A DREAM AND WHETHER THAT DREAM HAS BEEN REALISED AND A GARDEN MADE
THERE WAS JUST A HILLSIDE
WE WENT OUT AND DID
BUT IT WAS A LOT OF HARD WORK FOR BOTH OF THEM
WELCOME TO EGGHEADS
I'M THIRTY TWO AND I'M A PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR
I'M THIRTY TWO AND I'M A RESEARCHER
BUT WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND QUITE WHY THAT IS BUT
SO SORRY EVERYONE IF I GET THIS WRONG
SO I DON'T THINK I SHOULD BREAK THAT TRADITION
HOPE THAT IT'S THIRTY
I'M TRAINING TO BECOME ONE
THEY EXPECT SERVICES
YOU CAN BE PROSECUTED
AND IT'S UP TO A TWENTY
BUT HE STILL DOESN'T HAVE A LICENCE
A MAN HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF A PUBLIC ORDER OFFENCE AND FINED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS PLUS THREE HUNDRED POUNDS
PATRICIA SAYS SHE ISN'T PUTTING ANY MORE FOOD OUT
SHE WAS CONVICTED OF TWENTY THREE OFFENCES
SHE HAD BEEN IN A COMA SINCE BEING FOUND UNCONSCIOUS IN HER BATH SIX MONTHS AGO
HIS BODY WAS FOUND ON A BUILDING SITE
JOHN SEWELL IS FACING A POLICE INVESTIGATION
THIS IS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT
THE VICTORIES OF THE NAPOLEONIC WARS AT THE NILE
COPENHAGEN AND TRAFALGAR
BUT LIKE SO MANY OF THE SAILORS OF HIS ERA
HE SAW HIS FIRST REAL FIGHTING IN THE WEST INDIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA
AND HE HAD HIS FIRST COMMANDS IN THE WEST INDIES
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS
THE VERY BEST OF THOSE MEN WOULD HAVE CARRIED A THIMBLE IN THEIR POCKET
WHERE THE HEAT FROM THE TROPICS TURNS THE FRESH FOOD RANCID AND THE WATER GREEN WITH
AND AS ALWAYS WITH ARCHAEOLOGY
HISTORIANS WRITE ABOUT PLANTATIONS AND PLANTATION LIFE
AND IT'S ONLY THE SECOND TRENCH THAT WE'VE DUG
WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO LOOK AT NOT JUST THE PLANTATION AS A SYSTEM
BUT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED AND WORKED HERE
ONCE YOU GET SICK
WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THAT LEAD INSIDE THE BONE
AND IF IT'S BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE BONE
THERE CERTAINLY WERE
HE SUFFERED VERY FEW CASUALTIES THROUGH FEVERS
AND SCURVY WASN'T A PROBLEM FOR HIM BECAUSE BEING ONE OF THE DOUBT
SO THE SCURVY PROBLEM WASN'T SUCH A GREAT ONE
HE'S PUNISHED ANOTHER SAILOR CALLED JONATHAN MONROE
ON THE SAME DAY
HE HAS TO PUNISH HENRY WOOD WITH TWELVE LASHES FOR NEGLECT
IT WAS AN ACT OF SUICIDE
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY LOST
SO NEL NO KNEW HER FOR
WELCOME TO EGGHEADS
THE OTHER TWO ARE LATIN
SO I'M DRIVEN TO SAY THE GIRO D'ITALIA
SO I'LL GO FOR SOE
WHEN YOU'RE OUT FOR THE DAY AND NEED TO GRAB A BITE WHILE YOU'RE THERE
WHETHER YOU'RE A FAN OF MUSIC OR SPORT
IT'S HARD TO BEAT THE THRILL OF A DAY OUT WATCHING YOUR FAVOURITE STARS PERFORM LIVE IN FRONT OF
THERE'S THE PRICE OF THE TICKET
WE'VE GOT SANDWICHES IN OUR BAG
AND THE EXPENSE DOESN'T STOP THERE
FOOD AND DRINK AT THE VENUE CAN BE PRICEY
YOU COULD THROW IT IN FRONT OF THE TENNIS PLAYERS AND THEY COULD HAVE A REALLY BAD ACCIDENT
MAYBE A LAST MINUTE DESSERT AND SUDDENLY
THAT COULD LAND YOU WITH AN UNEXPECTED PENALTY AND LEAVE A VERY SOUR
IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BE SLOW
THERE ARE COMPANIES AND RESTAURANTS THAT PROUDLY BOAST THAT THEY DON'T USE IT
SOUR AND BITTER
BUT HAS MSG GAINED ITS POOR REPUTATION FOR NO GOOD REASON AND COULD IT BE THAT
WE HEAR SO MUCH NEGATIVE STUFF ABOUT A PARTICULAR INGREDIENT IN OUR FOOD THAT WE MIGHT BE PREPARED
IT'S CAUSED SO MUCH CONTROVERSY THAT
IT ALL STARTED IN THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTY S AND A PHYSICIAN WENT FOR A MEAL WITH HIS WIFE AT A CHINESE
ALTHOUGH STILL VERY WIDELY USED
IT'S CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE A NASTY CHEMICAL THAT IS BEST AVOIDED
WE ALL HAVE OUR GUILTY PLEASURES
AND A LOT OF BRITS WOULD SAY THAT YOU CAN'T BEAT THE OCCASIONAL TAKEAWAY
NOT LEAST BECAUSE IT GETS YOU OUT OF ALL THE WASHING UP
WE WE LIKE A BIT OF THAT
IF YOU'VE HAD AN UNWELCOME SURPRISE WHEN YOU WERE EATING ON THE HOOF
BUT IN THE MEANTIME
THANKS FOR JOINING US TODAY AND WHEREVER YOU'RE HAVING YOUR NEXT MEAL
WE HOPE IT'S A GOOD ONE
I KNOW THEY'VE GOT TO POLICE THE CAR PARK
I THINK I DO GET OUT EVERY NOW AND THEN
I'M TWENTY TWO AND I'M STUDYING CHINESE AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
I'M TWENTY AND I'M STUDYING HISTORY
I'M TWENTY TWO AND I STUDY BROADCAST JOURNALISM
WELCOME TO EGGHEADS
SO I IMAGINE THAT'LL BE BY THE SEA
UM PROBABLY TAKES UP MORE TIME THAN MY ACTUAL DEGREE BUT
BUT BASED ON NOTHING
AND IT'S HARRY O
I THINK I KNOW IT ANYWAY BUT
BUT THE OTHER TWO WERE DEAD BY THEN
TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
AH WANT TO GO OUT THERE AND LOOK FOR SOMEBODY
LET YOU LIVE IT DOWN IF YOU GET IT WRONG
I WANT THIS DAY TO BE SPECIAL
THIS IS NOT ORGANISING
I SERIOUSLY CAUGHT
CAN YOU BRING IT FORWARD TO TONIGHT
HIM LOOKING AT MY BUM
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S HERE
THIS IS TEN YEARS WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
THIS IS A LONG TIME COMING
AND OBVIOUSLY EVER SINCE I'VE MET DEAN
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS ATTEMPT TO BEAT POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ TEAM IN
MAYBE GUITAR OR PIANO
I'M TWENTY NINE AND I'M A MARKETING MANAGER
PEOPLE ARE BUYING THE STOCKS AND THE SHARES AND THE MARKET'S DOING WELL
AND TREEN IS MADE FROM WOOD
WHEN THE COALITION CAME IN
IT IS TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND WHICH
BUT I THINK THIS IS KINGSLEY WOOD
THOUSAND POUNDS SAYS THEY DON'T
WHAT THEY EAT IN THEIR HOMES
IT'S FROM THE HEAT
AND THEN YOU PUT IN THE HERBS
DRAGGING HER ALONG A PAVEMENT
THEY WON BY EIGHT WICKETS AT EDGEBASTON
DAVID CAMERON THINKS THE CRISIS WILL LAST ALL SUMMER
SPARKING THIS FIRE
OVER EIGHT MILLION OF US ARE RENTING OUR HOMES
THE HIGHEST NUMBER IN SIXTY YEARS
AND I WOULD SUGGEST IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A TENANCY TO ME
THEY'RE OPERATING ON THE FRONT LINE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS
GO DOWN THE STAIRS
AND IN THIS PROGRAMME
HE'S COME TO THE PROPERTY
TEN FIFTEEN MINUTE WALK
IT TURNS OUT THAT CHRIS AND I WERE RIGHT
MEGAN MO A TENANT
LANDLORD JOHN WAS SERVED WITH A NOTICE TO IMPROVE THE PROPERTY
THAT WORK HASN'T BEEN FINISHED BUT
AS HE'S AGREED NOT TO RENT THE PLACE OUT AGAIN UNTIL THE WORK'S BEEN DONE
YOU WOULD BE IN IN YOUR BIT
IT'S IN THE TOILET
ALL OF HIS COLLECTION
THE RENOVATION OF HIS OLD HOUSE IS ALMOST COMPLETE
NOW I'M FINDING THAT
AT LEAST SOME OF THE TIME
AND WHEN RICHARD VISITS TO CHECK ON PROGRESS
WE HAVE TO PROVE THAT IT'S NOT FIT
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
WE HAVE THE SECTION TWO THREE NOW WHICH IS THE POWER OF ENTRY NOTICE
AND WE CAN ENFORCE IT
SO OF THE RATS
IT'S OFTEN WORRIED NEIGHBOURS WHO ARE THE FIRST TO CALL OUT THE HOUSING OFFICERS TO SORT IT OUT
WE'VE BEEN LUCKY
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
SHE LEFT THE HOUSE TO A RELATIVE
HE WORKED WITH THE COUNCIL TO MAKE SURE THE HOUSE AND GARDEN WERE CLEARED OF RUBBISH AND A NEW ROOF
PAUL HAS SINCE GIVEN BIRTH TO ANOTHER DAUGHTER
WHEN WE SPOKE TO HIM
NEW MEASURES TO TRY TO STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COMING TO BRITAIN
TOM HAYES GOT FOURTEEN YEARS FOR RIGGING A LENDING RATE CALLED LIBEL
THE POLICE WATCHDOG IS INVESTIGATING
ON THESE PROGRAMS
SO THAT WHEN YOU GO SHOPPING
FRESH AND THAT WE KNOW WHERE IT COMES FROM
AND IF IT COMES FROM NEARBY
THEN ALL THE BETTER
BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR FOOD WHERE THE DEMAND FOR IT TO BE FRESH
A RESTAURANT MENU
FOR MOST SHOES
THAT'S ALL THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
IN THE NEW FOREST
I WASN'T TO PICK MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF KILOS
I'D BE WELL WITHIN THE LAW
BUT HERE IN EPPING FOREST
BUT MORE RECENTLY
WE HAD ISSUES WITH CAR PARKS
YOU'LL FEEL NAUSEATED
YOU MIGHTFORM
WE NEED TO BUY IN A LOT OF WHAT WE LIKE TO READ FROM OVERSEAS BUT WHILE WE IMPORT FROM ALL OVER THE
SOME OF THE FOOD COMING THROUGH OUR PORTS AND AIRPORTS MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH THE SAME
SO IT COULD POSE A SERIOUS RISK IF IT WERE TO GO ON SALE
A PIE CAN REALLY FUEL THE FANS ON THE TERRACES
WHETHER IT'S FROM A SHOP OR BEING SERVED TO US IN A RESTAURANT
I WAS SURE I WAS GOING TO DIE
BUT IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UK WITH A SERIOUS FOOD ALLERGY
I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE
AND WITH SO MANY PRODUCTS COMING FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT SUPPLIERS
FOR MANY RETAILERS
IS NO EASY TASK
IT SEEMS LIKE JANET AND STEWART HAVE GOT THEIR WORK CUT OUT TO ABIDE BY THE NEW LAWS WHEN YOU LOOK AT
GO TO SOMEWHERE AND SAY
ONE OF OUR MAIN SUPPLIERS HAS INFORMED US
THANKS FOR JOINING US
AND UNTIL THE NEXT TIME
I WANTED TO MAKE THE DECISION MYSELF
SO I THINK SHE IS IN BIG TROUBLE
WE DON'T KNOW WHY THIS HAS HAPPENED
BUT SOMETHING HAS INTERRUPTED WITH HIS LUNG GROWTH
IT IS EVERYTHING
SOMETIMES YOU GET SO
THAT ONLY TIME WILL TELL US HOW IT GOES
SOMETIMES ONE HAS TO EMBARK ON AN UNKNOWN JOURNEY LIKE THIS
ONE HAS TO TRY SOMETHING NEW AND DIFFERENT
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T
WHY ARE YOU WAKING ME UP SO
EVER GETTING HIM HOME
WITHOUT A BETTER INTERFACE
WE'RE NOT THERE YET
AND IF THEY DROP DOWN INTO HIS LUNGS
WHEN HE WAS A SMALL INFANT
WE HAVE TO WORK HARD
THAT'S QUITE REMARKABLE
IT'S RUNNING THE MIDDLE
YOU'VE GOT TAMAGO EGGS WHICH ARE LIKE THE BEST KIND OF SEMI HARD BOILED EGG IN THE WORLD
THEY CLOSELY GUARD THE SECRET OF THEIR STOCK
AND THE CEREMONIES THEREIN
AMAZING CULTURAL EXPERIENCE AND GREAT FOOD
ABOUT HER KNOWLEDGE FOR SPICES
THIS IS A DISH YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH
WHICH IS WHAT MARK IS MAKING
AND TAKE A FEW COMPONENTS OFF
IT'S NOT A TYPICAL SALA
IT'S NOT QUITE AS SIMPLE AS IT SEEMS AND CERTAINLY A SOLICITOR SHOULD CHECK OUT THE LEGAL PACK
THAT IF IT WAS RESOLD
IT IS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY
BUT THERE'S LOTS OF CONVERSION TO BE DONE AND ANY MORE NASTIES IN TERMS OF THE LEGAL PACK
NOT SOMETHING ON MOST PEOPLE'S CHECKLIST
BUT NOT IN THE WAY YOU MIGHT THINK
IMITATION IS THE HIGHEST FORM OF FLATTERY
HOW ABOUT SOME OFF ROAD PARKING
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
MUCH MORE SALEABLE
IT'S ALL REALLY SOLID
IT'S GOING TO NEED WORK
PAY THE RIGHT PRICE
LET'S SEE WHO ELSE THOUGHT SO WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
MAYBE NOT DOWN THIS ROAD
IS IT GOING TO TAKE JUSTIN'S OPTIMISTIC FOUR WEEKS TO DO
WHEN OUR SON WAS GOING TO UNIVERSITY
WE WOULD HOPE TO ACHIEVE IN THE REGION OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
I'M HERE TO SEE A BUNGALOW
SO WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND
THE BIG QUESTION IS
WILL MARTIN GET THE JOB FINISHED WITHIN SIX MONTHS
I GUESS IT ALL COMES DOWN TO WHETHER OR NOT IT'S AN INTERESTING FOOTBALL SEASON OR NOT
TIME HAS GONE BY AND IT'S THE DAY OF RECKONING
VERY HAPPY WITH
THREE BEDROOM HOUSE
THEY REALLY ARE THE ARTERIES OF THIS COUNTRY
YOU CAN TRAVEL FURTHER ON THE RAILWAYS FOR ONE POUND THAN YOU CAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
WHEREAS BACK IN THE UK
IT IS GOING TO BE A LONG JOURNEY
SO MOSTLY ON MY SKATES
SEVEN DAY ITINERARY
RIGHT FROM GOA TO THE WESTERN PART OF INDIA TO THE PALACES OF RAJAAH
MOST OF THE TIME
PASSENGER OR FREIGHT
POUNDS AND IT TAKES SIXTEEN HOURS ON THE TRAIN
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DO
BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD IT
FRIENDS AND FAMILY
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE ON BUSINESS TRIPS
I DID GET TO HAVE A GO ON MY OWN AND EVENTUALLY HAVE A GO IN A REAL LOCOMOTIVE AND THAT'S COMING UP
AND TRYING TO ESCAPE ARREST
AH WHERE CAN YOU FIND SOME OF THESE POTENTIAL NEST EGGS
DID THE BUYERS ON TODAY'S SHOW MANAGE THAT
AND IT WOULD MAKE A SUPERB FAMILY HOME
BUT WHY DO YOU NEED TWO SITTING ROOMS
THE HEART OF THE HOUSE
I THINK THERE IS
IF YOU TAKE OUT THIS WALL
WHICH IT'S MISSING
ALAN AND LISA ARE CLEARLY DELIGHTED WITH THEIR NEW HOME
AND WHO CAN BLAME THEM
THEY'VE GOT A BIG BUDGET
WHILE YOU'VE GOT IT BACK TO BRICK
HOW ABOUT CONVERTING THIS PROPERTY INTO TWO FLATS
I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD
WOULDN'T IT BE HEARTBREAKING TO CARVE UP THIS LOVELY OLD HOME
JUST WAITING FOR A NEW OWNER TO RAISE THEIR HAND AND TRANSFORM IT INTO SOMEWHERE THAT YOU CAN ENJOY
BUT THIS HOUSE HAS GOT SO MUCH MORE TO GIVE
AND THERE IS SO MUCH YOU CAN DO WITH THIS
IT'S CLOSER TO THE MORE DESIRABLE
FAMILY FRIENDLY PART OF THE AREA
HOW ABOUT AN ENSUITE BATHROOM
THAT LITTLE ROOM IS SO TINY
IT MIGHT BE WORTH ADDING A REALLY NICE ENSUITE TO THE BEDROOM AT THE BACK
PARTICULARLY AS THE PROPERTY I'M HERE TO SEE IS A FAMILY SIZED HOUSE WHICH HAD A GUIDE PRICE OF
THEY GET A SHARE OF OF SOME OF OUR INCOME AS PART OF THE ONGOING SUPPORT THAT THEY GIVE
YOUR TIME HAS COME TO ENTER THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IN A BIG WAY
BUT HER INVESTMENT MODEL IS INTERESTING AND I'M SO KEEN TO SEE HOW SHE GETS ON
BUT YES IT IS A WONDERFUL
I WOULD LOOK TO OFFER IT FOR SAL SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY
NEEDS BE REPLACED
THE FAMOUS POTTER AND CERAMIC ARTIST
BUT IS IT ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT
AND YOU'RE GOING TO REPLACE THE WINDOWS ANYWAY
MAYBE REPAINT THE OUTSIDE
A REAL NICE SURPRISE
HOPEFULLY YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING OVER THE YEARS ON THE SHOW TO KNOW WHETHER
NOT GOING TO SPEND TOO MUCH MONEY SORTING IT OUT
GOOD RENTAL OPPORTUNITY
SOLID HOUSE BANG
I THINK WE'RE VERY KEEN TO HAVE A GO BUT
NO STRINGS ATTACHED
JUST A BIT OF FINE TUNING REQUIRED
HAS ALL THE WORK THAT WAS PLANNED BEEN CARRIED OUT
HIGH STANDARD OF ACCOMMODATION
BUT WITH THE OPTION TO MOVE IT TO SIX AT A LATER DATE
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THE SAME HOUSE
I BELIEVE THAT SHE WOULD TOP OUT AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
THOUSAND FOR THE PROPERTY
BUT I KNOW I'VE SPENT MORE SINCE THEN
I WOULD SUGGEST AN ASKING PRICE OF NINETY NINE THOUSAND
AH SO MANY EXPERIENCES OF BUYING PROPERTIES AT AUCTION
NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE LIVE HERE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH WOMEN
I FEEL LIKE I'VE RELEASED THE ANGER AND THE ENERGY OF THE DAY
YESTERDAY WHEN I HAD THE INVITE
REALLY COOL AND AMAZING
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
WHEN I STARTED EGGHEADS
HISTORY WAS THE ONE SUBJECT I FEARED AND LOATHED THE MOST
MY NAME IS STEVE AND I AM A RETIRED UNIVERSITY LECTURER
MY NAME IS JIM AND I'M A MENTAL HEALTH TRIBUNAL MEMBER
MY NAME IS SHEILA
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS WHERE IT'S GOT A RULE
IF YOU DON'T KNOW
EIGHTY A BIT FUTURISTIC
PRESUMABLY NOT BEEN MONITORING THE SOAP OPERAS
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO COME UP WITH A RIVAL BRAND
I THINK WE'LL GO FOR BEND OVER BACKWARDS
HE HAS GOT A NEW YORK CONNECTION
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
MY NAME IS PATRICK
AND I AM A CUSTOMER INSIGHT MANAGER
THEY HAVE TICKETS
BACKGROUND I CAN ONLY THINK OF A LANGUAGE POINT OF VIEW
I LOOK DOWN AND YOU
WHETHER BITS OF IT WERE WORKING PROPERLY AND THAT
I THINK IT WAS A COMET
SO THAT'S MY ANSWER
THE FIRST INSTINCT I HAD WAS FUTURISM
I THINK IT ACTUALLY IS ST ANDREWS
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THE THE TENNIS CENTRE ITSELF
WHICH AS ALWAYS
THE COLOGNE CONCERT
THEY DON'T HAVE A STING BUT THEY HAVE GOT VERY SHARP JAWS AND THEY'RE ABLE TO SPRAY FORMIC
THERE IS A VERY CLOSE KNIT COMMUNITY
WHERE WE ACTUALLY
AND IF IT'S FAIR PLAY
NOT SOURCING LOCALLY
RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY
TRANSPORTED THOUSANDS OF MILES
GOING AROUND FIFTY THREE FIFTY THREE LOCATIONS
EVERYONE CAN DO BETTER
THE WHOLE UNIVERSE
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO DOWN TO FLORIDA AND BUY A CONDO
WHO FAMOUSLY GOT HIS NOBEL PRIZE FOR WORK HE DID ON QUANTUM MECHANICS
BUT HE NONETHELESS DIDN'T LIKE IT
GOD DOESN'T PLAY DICE
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
UM IT GOT A VERY FROSTY RECEPTION
IF YOU CAN JUST ACCEPT THAT YOUR INTUITION IS WRONG
AND YOU FIND THE PARTICLE OVER HERE
THEY MIGHT HAVE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE
THEY MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THE SAME STRENGTH OF FORCES WE HAVE
EVERYTHING WE SEE COULD BE IN SOME OF THESE OTHER BUBBLES AS WELL
SOME OF THE BUBBLES MIGHT NOT HAVE AN ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE
SOME OF THEM MIGHT HAVE AN ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE BUT IT'S MUCH STRONGER THAN OURS AND ATOMS
THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE ATOMS
HEADS I STICK AROUND
SO IF I THINK OF THE ROCKS AS THE ENERGY FIELD
AND THEN TO GET THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION
FOR THE INFLATIONARY MULTIVERSE YOU KNOW WE'RE NEVER GOING TO ACTUALLY HAVE ACCESS TO THESE OTHER WORLDS
DON'T CONTROL THE CHOICE OF HEAD TEACHERS
WHEN I BECAME PRIME MINISTER
I MEAN I DON'T CONTROL THE CURRICULUM
WE HAVE A HAPPY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE N
AND SINCE GOVERNMENT CHANGED POLICY ALL THE TIME AND
FIVE BILLION DIVIDED BY SEVENTY FIVE
BUT THE LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES MIGHT ARGUE THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO
I'M COMING WITH YOU
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT EDUCATION
YOU CAN'T EXPECT PARENTS TO MAKE THESE CHOICES
BEFORE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE CHILDREN
AND INSIST ON A THOROUGH AND RIGOROUS EXAMINATION OF ALL THE PROPOSALS
BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S A JOKE
AND AS YOU'VE LEFT EDUCATION TO THEM
ONE MUST ASSUME THAT UNTIL NOW
TAKE IT AWAY FROM THE LOCAL COUNCIL
PUT IT UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
YOU COULD TAKE THE BULL BY ONE HORN WITH THE OTHER HAND
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION MARKS WHERE THE CORPSE OF BRITISH EDUCATION IS BURIED
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS
DENSITY OF SCHOOLING REQUIRED IN URBAN AND RURAL AREAS
BUT YOU HAVE TO STOP THE LIQUIDATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD IDEA
WE WILL SAY SORRY
THAT IS YOUR CONCERN
KEEP THE EXISTING STAFF AND YOU PUT IN AN EXTRA BLAIR OF COORDINATATING MANAGEMENT
I'LL TELL THEM TO GO AHEAD WITH THE PROSECUTION
I CAN JUST SEE THE NEWSPAPERS
I DON'T THINK WE CAN USE THEM
I'LL HAVE TO SAY
BUT ON THE PRODUCERS SIDE
NOT A HEALTH AND WELLBEING ONE
THERE'S AN OBSESSION WITH COST EFFECTIVENESS
I GUESS YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND THE RESOURCES
YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S NOT VERY NICE TO KILL ANIMALS
WITHIN THE COUNTRY AND PUT BACK INTO OUR
AND THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT WALES BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD
AT A TIME OF ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS
AT A TIME OF FINANCIAL RECESSION
OF COURSE YOU WILL HAVE TO COMPROMISE
THEN I THINK THAT WOULD BE GOOD ALL ROUND
WELL WE'VE GOT LOTS OF OTHER REMARKABLE ANIMALS ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME
WE WE DO HAVE A HIND
KNOW IT WAS IT WAS A GREAT SHOCK
BUT THE GREAT THING ABOUT INFRARED IS THAT THE LIONS AND WE CAN'T SEE IT
SO IT WILL TOTALLY NOT DISTURB THEM
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY PAINT THE CEILING
NOT FLYING INTO THAT BUT
AND THEN THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY TO THE OVIDUCT
THEY PROBABLY NEVER WILL
THESE GUYS CAN LIVE
MORNING ON CHECK THIS MORNING
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO EXECUTE THIS ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY OR ELSE
THERE'S NOTHING TO HIDE BEHIND HERE
IT WILL BE LOVELY TO EAT
I FELT THAT I DID BUT
THAT'LL DO BAKING IN THAT SENSE
COVERED IN LUXURIOUS STICKY JAM AND THEN SOME LIGHT
GOLDEN SPONGE WRAPPED AROUND THAT
BUT I KNOW THEY ARE
IT'S A POSITIVE
THE PERCEPTION THAT STRAIGHT RIVERS WAS A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT
THAT WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL DRIVERS FOR THESE PROJECTS
BECAUSE BY DOING THAT
AND WITH FARMERS SAYING THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO GROW CROPS
WAS THE BAN WORTH IT
BANNING THEM WAS A PRECAUTION
THAT MEANS THEY HAVE SPECIAL PERMISSION TO USE SEEDS TREATED WITH NEONICOTINOID PESTICIDES THIS
A LOT OF OUR NEIGHBOURS LOST CROPS
THERE WAS A LOT OF EXTRA SPRAYING OF PYRETHOIDS AND OTHER PESTICIDES
FLEA BEETLES ARE MUNCHING THEIR WAY THROUGH ACRES OF OILSEED RAPE
THE GOVERNMENT TURNED THAT DOWN
AFTER WHEAT AND BARLEY
RAPE IS THE COUNTRY'S THIRD LARGEST CROP
AND OILSEED RAPE IS NO DIFFERENT BUT
IS TO TAKE YOU TO SEE SOME BEES
HOW LONG TILL WE GET SOME ANSWERS
BUT IT'SS THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF OTHER SPECIES OF BEES THAT ARE REALLY
IT'S GOING TO GO ON A LOT LONGER THAN THAT
THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT IS VERY
AND ONLY WHEN WE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IMPACT NEW NICOINOIDS HAVE ON THEIR HEALTH
AND IT'S ABOUT TRYING
OR ELSE THEY WERE WIPED OUT BECAUSE NEXT DOOR HAD BEEN WIPED OUT
THEY ARE TRYING TO HOLD ON TO THAT CHAMPIONSHIP
METERS IT MEANS THEY CAN OBSERVE IN FANTASTIC DETAIL EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE
SHE TRAVELS THE WORLD JUDGING SHEEPDOG TRIALS AND TRAINING DOGS ALONG WITH THEIR OWNERS
IT'S NOT REALLY SHEEP COUNTRY
WE ARE FROM FARMING BACKGROUNDS
IT'S GOING TO BE DOWN TO MUM AGAIN
THAT'S JUST ON ONE DAY AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE THAN THAT
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
WITH A LITTLE BIT EVERY DAY
I'M DAVE AND I'M A LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR
I'M MIKE AND I'M A CUSTOMER SERVICE ADVISOR
DAVE'S IN HAMELHAMSTEAD
I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE SATURDAYS BUT
I THINK THE ILLUMINATI
WHICH ONE IS IT
I DON'T THINK IT'S CAPE ROTH
I'LL GO FOR MALIN HEAD
AND LET'S ASSUME THIS IS THE MAIN AIRPORT OF THE COUNTRY
WE CAN CERTAINLY CROSS OUT ROBSON AND JEROME
I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT BUT
I'VE ALREADY SCATTERED YOUR FATHER SAS ONCE
OK WHATEVER HAPPENS
I SURVIVED IN THAT PLACE
MY NAME IS KYLE
AND I STUDY PHILOSOPHY
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS ONE OF MY BIG BLACK SPOTS
THE SWORDS AND ROMANCE BITS
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY JUST RADIO
THINK IS RINGING BELLS FOR WATERGATE
OH YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU SPELL THOSE
NO IDEA ABOUT WHERE WINE COMES FROM AT ALL
SO THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
IT IS TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
AND WIND UP PERSON SOUNDS A BIT INTENSE
BECAUSE OF THE PREFIX AREA
JOIN US NEXT TIME TO SEE IF A NEW TEAM OF CHALLENGERS HAVE THE BRAINS TO DEFEAT THOSE PESKY
IN TODAY'S PROGRAMME
WITHIN FIVE YARDS
SHE WAS ASKING ME QUESTIONS
AND I GOT TO BE HONEST
THEIR HOUSE IS PROBABLY THE MOST ATTRACTIVE TO BURGLARS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
POSSIBLY FINGERPRINTS ON IT AS WELL
SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT
HE IS COMING BACK TOMORROW
AND I HAVE HAD TO
WHICH HAS BEEN PRETTY AWFUL
SO YOU FEEL COMPLETELY POINTLESS ALMOST
BUT IF WE DO OBTAIN A DNA PROFILE
SO BEFORE THE POLICE CAN EVEN CHECK FOR WHOSE MUM AND DAD IN THE ADDRESS BOOK
IN THIS POLICE LAB
THERE IS A MOBILE PHONE THAT'S BEING TESTED FOR TRACES OF DNA
SO THAT IF THE BIKE IS MOVED
IT' GOING TO BE MUCH
UNTIL NEXT TIME
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
I'M MALCOLM AND I AM A TAXI DRIVER
I'M A RETIRED CONTRACTS MANAGER
I'M CHUCK AND I'M A RETIRED CABLE JOINTURE
IT'S GOT ITS OWN GENDER
IF YOU'RE FROM HEIGHT
YOU'RE FROM HEIGHTTON
IF YOU'RE FROM KE
I'LL I'LL PLUMP FOR FORTY
THE WHO HITS FORTY
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER
AH YOU'VE YOU'VE GOT ME ON THIS ONE
SOUNDS A BIT COUNTRY
OFF GO THE SUN
IF THEY LAY IT ON REALLY
I THINK IT MUST BE CINDERELLA
WE'RE GOING TO GO HONG KONG
THIRTY MINUTES LATE
AND THEREFORE ALL THE OTHER PATIENTS' PERSONAL FOIBLES
AND CERTAINLY WE
SO DEMANDING MORE
LACK OF MOBILITY AND
HE WAS FOUND TO HAVE A BRAIN TUMOUR
I AM AT PEACE ABOUT HIS DEATH
I WANT HIM TO BE PEACEFUL AND PAIN FREE
BUT BUT IT WAS BETTER THAN IT WAS THIS MORNING
WE SEEM THESE DAYS TO ALMOST SEE DEATH AS A FAILURE
I'VE DEFINITELY HAD IT
AND VERY PEACEFULLY
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING QUITE CLOSE TO FAMILIES
WE MEET EVERY WEEK
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER DRAMATIC WEEKEND IN THE WOMEN'S SUPER LEAGUE WITH TITLES TO PLAY FOR
TOP FLIGHT STATUS TO PLAY FOR
AND THERE'VE BEEN PLACES IN THE ENGLAND SQUAD TO PLAY FOR
THE LIONESSES BEGIN THEIR QUEST TO REACH THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP LATER THIS MONTH
WHEN THEY FACE ESTONIA AWAY
AND WE CAN NOW EXCLUSIVELY REVEAL THE SQUAD CHOSEN BY MARK FOR THAT QUALIFIER
SHE'S SHOWN SOME REAL LEADERSHIP QUALITIES AT CHELSEA
WHICH IS GETTING THREE POINTS
FROM WHAT I THE PEOPLE I SPOKE TO AT BRISTOL ON THE WEEKEND
TICKET SALES ARE IN A GOOD PLACE
SO WE ARE REALLY EXCITED
TO GO BACK TO A PLACE WHERE I ENJOYED SUCH SPECIAL MEMORIES IT WILL BE A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY
THE STAKES WERE HIGH
SPENDING MATCH DAY WITH SOME OF THE BRISTOL PLAYERS
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS
THAT IS THE REALITY OF THE WSL AND
BIRMINGHAM SCORING TWO GOALS INSIDE OF A MINUTE
WHETHER THAT BE DOMESTICALLY OR THE WORLD CUP
DOUBT GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO THROUGH SOME REHAB
YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOU NEED TO BE AN INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALL IT'S CERTAINLY DIFFERENT
THE MENTAL SIDE OF IT
THE CHARACTER SIDE OF IT
IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT
WE' GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO GROW THAT AND MAKE SURE WE GET THE RIGHT PERSONALITIES
SO WE'VE CERTAINLY GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT PLAYERS WITH THOSE CHARACTERISTICS
WE SUPPORT THEM TO GET THERE BUT
IT'S GREAT TO KNOW WE'VE GOT PLAYERS NOW GROUP WITH THOSE QUALITIES AND ALSO PLAYERS OUTSIDE THE
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL
IS THERE THE ONLY CLUB IN THE LEAGUE NOT ASSOCIATED DIRECTLY WITH A MEN'S FOOTBALL CLUB WHICH
OR LESS SHARED RESOURCES
SO LINKED TO A COLLEGE
ACCESSING FACILITIES AND SOME YOUNG PLAYERS
SO THERE'S SOME HUGE CHALLENGES FOR THE FOOTBALL CLUB MOVING FORWARD BUT
THEY CAN'T COMPETE FINANCIALLY WITH THE OTHER CLUBS IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL WAGE SALARY FOR PLAYERS
BUT YEAH THERE'S SOME OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL
THINK THEY CAN FIND A WAY TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH YOUNG PLAYERS PARTICULAR WILL FIND THE TRAINING
YOU DON'T PICK UP RESULTS
YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF AT THE WRONG END THE TABLE AND
THE TOP TWO IN WSL TWO WENT HEAD TO HEAD ON SATURDAY NIGHT
AS READING HOSTED DONCASTER IN A MATCH THAT COULD'VE GONE A LONG WAY TO DECIDING THE DESTINY OF THE
IT'S A GIVEN THAT WE'LL WORK HARD AND WE'LL WE'LL GO RIGHT TO THE END AND WE'LL PUT UP A FIGHT
AS LONG AS WE STRENGTHEN AGAIN
AND I THINK WE CAN WE CAN PUSH PUSH ON AND COMPETE WITH THESE TEAMS
IT IS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE STRENGTH FOR NEXT YEAR
CHELSEA REMAIN IN POLL POSITION FOR THE TITLE AND
IT'S LOOKING LIKE IT'LL BE BIRMINGHAM WHO WON'T BE LETTING GO OF THEIR TOP FLIGHT STATUS
SO BOTH THOSE CLUBS WILL BE LOOKING TO ACTUALLY FINISH OFF THE SEASON AND GET PROMOTION BUT
BUT THE CHALLENGE
TO RECOVER PROPERLY
AND IT'S THAT PROFESSIONAL MENTALITY WHICH HAS HELD US BACK IN THE PAST
AND WISH STILL LEARNING THAT HERE
AND AS A NATION
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A PROFESSIONAL PLAYER
WHAT'S THE DEDICATION YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE
BUT THE QUICKER WE CAN LEARN
THE MORE WE CAN GET PLAYERS BEING PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES
WHEN YOU FIRST ENTER A CHANGE ROOM AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN
YOU'VE GOT SOME SENIOR PROS WHO CAN HELP GUIDE YOU THROUGH
AND WE HAVEN'T REALLY GOT THAT
WE'VE GOT OLDER PLAYERS WHO'VE GOT SOME FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE
SO WE'RE ALL LEARNING THE GAME
WE'VE SET OURSELVES THAT CHALLENGE
AND WE WANT TO BE AN ELITE SPORTS TEAM
NOT JUST A FOOTBALL TEAM
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP GROWING THIS GROUP OF PLAYERS WE'VE GOT
BECAUSE THE WORLD CUP IS THE END FOR US
IT WAS A CHE
STRONG FOUNDATIONS IN PLACE
WE'VE GOT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY NOW IN TERMS OF EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS
AND FIVE OR TEN OR TEN PERCENT OF THOSE CHICKS THAT HATCH SURVIVE
VERY HIGH MORTALITY RATE
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A BIG DESK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YOU DON'T EXPECT THAT YOU KNOW
BUT THERE WAS NO OTHER SIGNS
THAT WE KNOW OF
FOR YOUR INFORMATION
YOU'VE GOT TEN MINS ON YOURRINGE
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER
I WORK FULL TIME
DAVID CAMERON HAS GIVEN HIS STRONGEST BACKING YET FOR SHALE GAS AND THE CONTROVERSIAL PROCESS OF
THE PROCESS OF EXTRACTING IT
SO WHO ACTUALLY DECIDES WHETHER THE ENERGY COMPANIES CAN DRILL
THE HEALTH AND SAFETY EXECUTIVE
AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW WE EXTRACT THE GAS OR WHO DECIDES WHERE IT COMES FROM
AS WITH MOST THINGS
AND THOUGH IT GAINED NEW IMPORTANCE DURING THE CONFLICT
BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO GROW MORE FOOD
THE WI HAS RUN MANY CAMPAIGNS ON ISSUES SUCH AS BREAST SCREENING
BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES AND EQUAL PAY
AS THEY BATTLE IT OUT TO BE CROWNED COUNTRYFILE ONE MAN AND HIS DOG CHAMPIONS
WE'VE BEEN FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT THE TEAMS
AND ADAM HAS MET THE WELSH HOPEFULS
I GO TO THE POST TO WIN EVERY TIME
PEOPLE SAY IT'S ME IT'SLETING THAT'S IMPORTANT
IT PART
HE STARTED OUT EVEN YOUNGER THAN HENRIETTA
HE WAS ENGLISH NATIONAL CHAMPION
WE LOVE OUR COUNTRYSIDE
ON THIS PROGRAMME IT'S AT THE HEART OF EVERYTHING WE DO
COUNTRYFILE IS LAUNCHING A JOINT VENTURE WITH BBC CHILDREN IN NEED
ACHIEVE SOMETHING QUITE SPECTACULAR
WE WILL BE LAUNCHING THE FIRST EVER COUNTRYFILE RAMBLE FOR BBC CHILDREN IN NEED
WE WANT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY TO GET OUT THERE WALKING AND RAISING MONEY
MONEY THAT WILL FUND VITAL PROJECTS
EVERY TWENTY MINUTES
A CHILD LOSES A PARENT
THREE CHILDREN WILL BE BEREAVED
SO DONATE NOW IF YOU CAN
SO I THINK I'LL SERVE FIRST
AND I'M A PUBLISHING MANAGER
I'M A RETIRED IT MANAGER AND OCCASIONAL QUIZMASTER
THE REST OF THEM PLAYING DIFFERENT TEAMS
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT WILL CROP UP THAT I HADN'T THOUGHT OF
IF I HAD TO SAY
I DON'T THINK IT'S BALTIMORE
WELL I KNOW IT'S PART OF THE COMMONWEALTH
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND WHICH
LOOKING AT THE DATES
JOIN US NEXT TIME HERE TO SEE IF A NEW TEAM OF CHALLENGERS WILL BE JUST AS SUCCESSFUL
THIS IS REALLY SERIOUS
A BIT LIKE A FAMILY HEIRLOOM
GIVEN AT THE RIGHT TIME
THEN PEOPLE STARTED MENTIONING OVER THE NEXT DAY OR TWO
YOU NORMALLY FEEL THE BEAT OVER HERE
WHILE THE LIVER
WHICH IS AN ENORMOUS ORGAN
THEN YOU SEE SOME PRETTY STRIKING DIFFERENCES
MY HEART IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE
I'M A VOLUNTEER AT NORTHERN AIR HOSPITAL RADIO
SO ON THAT BASIS
FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE ORDER OF MERIT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT A GREAT DEAL
BUT I THINK I'M GOING TO STICK WITH RORY
I'M GOING TO GO DOWN THE RIGHT
WHAT WORD IS BY CONVENTION USED TO MEAN SPEEDS GREATER THAN FIVE
I HAVE AROUND ABOUT SIX
IN CARRY ON DON'T LOSE YOUR HEAD
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
IT IS TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
OPPOSITE TO THE FIRST ONE
WE'VE BEEN FINE
WE'VE HAD A VERY BUSY WEEK
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S GONE THERE WITH A BROOM
DO WE REALLY NEED A FIVE BEDROOM BUNGALOW
THE BUDS ARE EMERGING
IT'S IT'S AN OLD BUNKER
WE HAD LOTS AND LOTS OF RABBIT SHOTS ON HERE
AND THE OLD BUILDINGS WE SEE THERE
THEY'RE BUILDING A NEST
BECAUSE WHEN THE WINGS OPEN
WHAT DID THEY DO WITH THEM
JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN
THEY'D HEARD ABOUT THE PYRAMIDS AT GIZA
BUT AS SYMBOLS OF BRITISH MIGHT
THROUGH THE DESERTS
THE ENTRY OF ARCHAEOLOGY INTO ACADEMIA FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED THE WAY WE VIEWED THE PAST AND THE
AND ALL OF ITS FINEST SCHOLARS QUICKLY GOT TO WORK
AND THEN SUDDENLY
WITH THE HEADS COVERED
THE HEAT WAS SUFFOCATING AND IN THE MORNING
THERE WERE ALSO FLESH EATINGATING INSECTS THAT BURROWED INTO ONE'S BODY
AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
THE POWER OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
IT ASSEMBLED A VERY IMPRESSIVE ETHNOGRAPHICAL COLLECTION
HE WAS ABLE TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO HIS PASSION ARCHAEOLOGY
COME RAIN OR SHINE
THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE
HE'S OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE THE FATHER OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC ARCHAEOLOGY
BECAUSE HE HAD SUCH A PRECISE APPROACH TO RECORDING HIS EVIDENCE
SO IT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR HIM TO JUST SAY IT CAME FROM A PARTICULAR SITE
YOU CAN SEE THAT THROUGH THE PUBLICATIONS
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO SEE THIS AS AN ADVENTURE
I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR ME
I AM AGREEING WITH YOU
WHEN THE HOT AIR BEGAN TO RISE
THAT WAS A DEADLY COCKTAIL FOR THE PERFECT STORM
THE HAILSTONES WERE HELD UP IN THAT SUPER COOL CLOUD WHERE THEY BUMPED INTO OTHER WATER
SO THE COLD CAN BE A KILLER
IT'S GOT A MEANS OF PROTECTING ITS CELLS FROM DAMAGE
A TECHNIQUE CALLED SUPER COOLING
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL LIVING THAT MUCH LONGER AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT WE WANT A LONG LIFE WITH OUR
SO HOW DOES IT STOP FROM BECOMING A FURRY ICE POP
THESE REMARKABLE LITTLE RODENTS HAVE ANOTHER AMAZING TRAIT
OUR BODIES ARE NOT THE ONLY THING THAT WE WANT TO MAINTAIN
WHAT IF I WERE TO TELL YOU THAT WE COULD PRESERVE EVERYTHING ON OUR PLANET
BUT LET ME TRY AND EXPLAIN
THEY'RE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS
IT MIGHT BE A BIT MORE DIFFICULT
BUT IT ALWAYS COMES OUT AS ONES AND ZEROS
ONLY ONE PERSON WILL HAVE ALL THOSE COPIES
IT'S ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE
I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT
HE'S ALWAYS A GOOFY
EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN THINK OF THAT YOU WOULD IMAGINE SOMEBODY HAD SEVEN SHOTS OF WHISKY DOING
BECAUSE UNBEKNOWN TO NICK AND COWEN
IT WAS TERRIFYING
EVERY SINGLE DAY
WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES AT THE TOP OF A FOOD CHAIN THAT ARE VULNERABLE TO A DEADLY TONIC
PUT THE GREAT WHITE INTO A STATE OF TONIC IMMOBILITY AND THEN IT HELD IT THERE FOR FIFTEEN
AND THAT IS THE CLEVER PART
SHARKS HAVE TO KEEP SWIMMING IN ORDER TO BREATHE
ON THE SURFACE OF IT
I'VE GOT TO SAY
IF YOU'VE EVER TRODDEN ON ONE OF THESE MOLLUSCS IN BARE FEET
THERE IS ANOTHER SEA CREATURE WHICH HAS A FORMIDABLE
THESE TINY TEETH
LESS THAN A MILLIMETRE LONG
ALLEGEDLY THAT IDEA CAME FROM GANNETS
THEY HAVE AIR BAGS IN THEIR BODIES SO THAT WHEN THEY PLUNGE INTO THE WATER AT HIGH SPEED
THEY DON'T GET HURT
A BUILDING IS GREAT
THESE DAYS THERE ARE ONLY TWENTY
THOUSAND AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU
ALTHOUGH THESE PENGUINS ARE A BIT OF A NUISANCE
THE AFRICAN PENGUIN IS
THERE WERE ONE AND A HALF MILLION PAIRS
WHICH MEANS IT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE THE LAVA ITSELF
AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING AND WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO TURN INTO
SIBLINGS AS WELL
HOW PEOPLE DEVELOP AND THE STORIES THEY TELL YOU ABOUT
BUT THE GREAT OUTDOORS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE PHYSICAL CHALLENGES AS ELLIE DISCOVERED WHEN SHE CAME
KEEP THE DOGS UNDER CONTROL
NOT JUST SORT OF
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT
BUT WHAT MOST OF US DO LOVE IS WALKING THROUGH OUR GLORIOUS COUNTRYSIDE
MANY OF THEM FROM RURAL BACKGROUNDS
AND SINCE IT'S OUR IDEA
EACH OF US FROM THE TEAM WILL BE TREKKING ACROSS A DIFFERENT PART OF THE BRITISH ISLES AND WE'LL BE
GO ON OUR WEBSITE
BUT WHAT DOES MATTER IS DOING SOMETHING
IF YOU ARE ABLE
BECAUSE YOUR CONTRIBUTION COULD ALLOW OTHER CHILDREN LIKE CAMERON THE VITAL SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED
AH WALKING IN OUR GLORIOUS COUNTRYSIDE IS A PLEASURE
FOR ONE WEEKEND
ALSO GIVE IT THE POWER TO CHANGE LIVES FOREVER
SO WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT
THE LEGENDARY ONE MAN AND HIS DOG IS BACK
THE ROYAL FLYING CORPS
HIS SITTERS WERE PARTICULARLY WELL KNOWN
AND SHE HAD THIS AFFAIR WITH EDWARD BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY THREE
I THINK IF YOU WERE TO PUT IT ONTO THE MARKET NOW IN AN AUCTION
CERTAINLY IN THE CUTTING
HAVE YOU BEEN TO A JAPANESE PARTY
BOYS WOULD BE BOYS
SHE THEN WENT AND GOT A CUP OF TEA AND SHE WOULDN'T GO TO THE MEDICAL CENTRE UNTIL SHE'D HAD ONE FROM THE
FROM THE ANTIQUESRO TEAM AND OF COURSE
IT'S ALWAYS NICE AND WARM
IF YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU' TRY AND COME FIRST THING BEFORE TOO MANY PEOPLE HAD BEEN BATHING BECAUSE THE MORE PEOPLE
BUT UNLESS YOU HAVE AN IDENTICAL TWIN
MY NOSE STARTED UP THERE
YOU CAN POINT TO THE PARTICULAR GENE AND SAY IT'S THAT ONE
HE'S JUST HORRIBLE
WHICH WAS GREAT
IF YOU POP ALL OUR BRAINS OUT RIGHT NOW
THAT'S HAPPENING IN MY FAMILY
THAT HAPPENED WITH MY NEIGHBOUR
THAT HAPPENED WITH MY COUSIN
THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW
RANDOM MUTATION CAN BE SPREAD
OUT THERE IN THE WIDER WORLD
IT WOULD BECOME DILUTED
ENVIRONMENT AND CULTURE
THE HAROGATE TOFFEE IS UNIQUE
OF NOT IMPINGING ON THE GUESTS' PRESENCE IN HARROGATE
INDULGENT MENUS THESE DAYS
ESPECIALLY AS I HAVE A RAVEN
AND THEN I'D COME HOME FROM WORK
WOULD HAVE A MODERN RECIPE
WITHOUT ME HELPING YOU
NEARLY THREE DECADES LATER
I'M GOING TO JOIN THOSE FOUR SAME MEN AS THEY TRY AND PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN IN A MUSEUM
THIS IS FASCINATING
BUT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET SORT OF MEDIEVAL
BASICALLY EXPENSE TO BUILD
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY A LOT HARDER TO BUILD A VAULT THEN YOU MIGHT AT FIRST
SO WE'VE DONE THIS HALFWAY
WHEN THAT'S SET
FROM THE LEVEL ABOVE
OTHER CHURCHES IN THE TOWN WERE BEING EMBELLISHED
THIS IS FORMALLY SIMILAR
THAN STAINLESS STEEL
THE ROMANS BUILDINGS USED TO FALL APART IN A FEW DECADES
OF PUTTING UP THE ARMS OF IMPORTANT PEOPLE
BOTH NATIONALLY AND LOCALLY
THE NEW MERCHANT CLASS
THERE ARE PLENTY OF WINKLES HERE
SO IT'S A CLOSELY GUARDED SECRET
GIVE OR TAKE A BIT
THIS WAS MY FIRST VISIT TO BROADSET AND I CAME HERE IN SEARCH OF MY OLD FAVOURITE
AND THEY WEREN'T ON RATION
BUT THE JURY WEREN'T EXPECTING THAT ONE
NO THAT'S NOT TRUE
IT'S IT'S BEEN A SELF INVENTED FAITH
I'VE SOUGHT OUT A CHURCH
JUST TO KEEP STICKING OUT THINGS
I DEVELOPED A CONDITION CALLED JUVENILE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
TO WHET YOUR APPETITE
HERE'S A SONG OF THANKSGIVING FROM THIS YEAR'S SENIOR
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING UP IN THIS CHURCH TOWER
TODAY THOSE NATIONS FACE EACH OTHER ONCE AGAIN
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
NOTHING PUBLISHED BUT YOU NEVER KNOW
THERE WAS A LOT THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
CROWDS OF UP TO FIFTY THREE
THEY ACTUALLY HAD ABOUT FIFTY FIVE
TO TO WHERE WE WERE
A MONUMENTAL BRONZE DOOR INSPIRED BY DANTE'S
IT IS TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
NO THAT'S YOUR EYE
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
THE LOCAL FIREFIGHTERS TAKE THEIR FIRE ENGINE TO THE OTHER SIDE
THEY HAVE A NICE WALK OUT ON BOXING DAY
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
IT IS TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
THEY ALWAYS GIVE YOU SECOND HELPINGS
I'M GROWING THEM TOO
WARM SUNNY DAYS
I KNOW THE CHEFS JUST GO LIKE THAT AND ALL THE JUICE COMES OUT
YOU GIRLS DON'T DO ENOUGH BAKING
YOU COULD ADD CHICKEN
ALL VERY SIMPLE
A SIMPLE PLASTIC BAG
I HAD ONE WHEN I WAS FIRST MARRIED
A SOUR EXPRESSION AND NO MAKE UP
THESE FRUIT PIES
BECAUSE WOMEN NORMALLY IGNORE YOU BUT
BUT NOW YOU'VE GOT MADGE GOING
I GAVE HER A BIG SMILE
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND
BUT HE'S VERY SWEET
THAT I'M TRYING TO
I'M TRYING TO GET MADGE INTERESTED TO SORT OF TAKE HER MIND OFF ME AND MAVIS
I'M PUTTING HIM BACK ON THE PEDALS
BUSINESS LIKE MANNER
AND I HAVE THE SOLUTION
PUT THESE ON FIRST
I TOLD YOU CENTRE OF ATTENTION
DON'T STAND THERE GIGGLING AWAY IN TWO LANGUAGES
IF YOU MUST KNOW
I DON'T BELONG TO ANY CLUB
I DO A FEW PRESS UPS AT HOME
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BOTHER WITH IT
AH YOU LOOK HOW IT IS
AND IF YOU DAMPEN THAT DOWN
THAT'S NOT TRUE
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR DOG AND YOU LOVE YOUR DOG
THE ONLY POSITIVE IS
IT LOOKS IT LOOKS A LOT MORE
THAT'S PACKED WITH VITAMIN K
THEY LOOK ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
INCREDIBLE VALUE AND VERSATILE
I KNOW WHICH ONES I PREFER FOR COOKING
IT WAS THE BEST THING WE EVER DID
NOT REALLY TO RACE THROUGH
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU REALLY NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET
NEXT TIME AROUND I COULD COME BACK HERE AND GET AWAY THIS BIG
INHUMANE AND CHALLENGE THE EXTENT TO WHICH BADGERS ARE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM
EVEN HERE IN ENGLAND WHERE CULLING IS GOING ON IN THREE AFFECTED COUNTIES
AND OF COURSE TO PROTECT THEIR STOCK AND TO PROTECT THEIR
I'D LIKE TO SEE THE FARMING INDUSTRY TAKING IT SERIOUSLY
THERE'S LOTS OF ANECDOTAL THINGS ABOUT BEST PRACTICE
MY CATTLE ARE HOUSED FOR ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS OF THE YEAR
BUT IT CAN BE EXPENSIVE
SO CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU
THAT DECISION WAS DOWN TO YOU
AND YOU DIDN'T HOLD BACK
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF VOTES WERE COUNTED
WHETHER YOU SENT IN PHOTOS OR ENCOURAGED SOMEONE ELSE TO
BUT IT DOESN'T END THERE
BECAUSE THEY ARE A TRICKY SPECIES TO PHOTOGRAPH AT THE BEST OF TIMES
WHOS BEEN REHABILITATING THIS HEDGEHOG AFTER BRINGING IT IN UNDERWEIGHT
AND WE JUST WANTED IT TO BE REALLY OPEN
TO SEE WHERE THEY'RE NESTING
I'VE COME TO PICK A FEW UP
THAT'S THE PLAN
BUT ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES WITH SIGHT
NEXT WEEK WE'RE IN CHESHIRE WHERE MATT WILL BE HOPING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF ONE OF NATURE'S
INTO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
I DIDN'T BUY THEM
AND HE DIED FOUR YEAR AGO
AS LONG AS IT HADN'T BEEN BEQUEATHED TO SOMEBODY ELSE
BECAUSE IT COST MORE MONEY TO SIGN THE PLATES
DOING YOURSELF UP
WHEN THERE ARE NO MINES
THEY OUGHT TO TURN OFF NOW
IT WAS A DRAGON OR A SERPENT LIKE CREATURE THAT WENT AROUND EATING PEOPLE AND ABDUCTING CHILDREN AND
AND MALTEIL IS QUITE A COLLECTABLE AREA
THAT IS AMAZING
FROM THE TEAM AND THE EXPERTS
SHE DOES NATURALLY LOOK GREAT IN STUFF THAT SHOWS OFF HER CURVES
THANKS TO THE PERSISTENCE OF LOCAL PEOPLE AND PLANNERS
IT WAS AH IT WAS ABSOLUTELY THE PLACE TO BE YOU KNOW
IT WAS LONDON ZOO
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF PEOPLE YOU HAD
THE GREAT HUSTLER
I WOULD IMAGINE A BUILDING LIKE THIS
WHICH MEANS THAT CLAUDE GOT ALL HIS BRICKS FROM OVER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILES AWAY
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT PLANES ARE ABOUT
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE INTEND TO PUT RIGHT
AND THEN HE WAS ALSO A GREAT PERSUADER
HE WAS THE JAMIE OLIVER OF AVIATION
VERY MUCH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
HE WAS A MAN WHO LIKED GETTING HIS HANDS DIRTY
ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF THEIR HEROISM
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE AVIATION
AND WE HOPE THAT THE GREAT MAN
I NEVER REALLY IMAGINED THAT IN PUTTING IT BACK TOGETHER
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE MARKET'S DOING
REALLY I MEAN COMPARED TO THE DOWNSTAIRS
WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT AND I'VE NEVER HAD ENOUGH TIME
UM THEY'VE PUT SOME OF THEIR SAVINGS INTO IT
SO WHEN YOU GET BIT OLDER AND NEED TO BUY ONE
I'M THINKING TWELVE
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET ON
USED TO PUT THE BATHROOM BACK UPSTAIRS
HAVING BATHROOMS DOWNSTAIRS CAN BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT
DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF THE REFURB
SO WHO WAS READY TO TAKE ON THIS CAMBERWELL COTTAGE
AND I CAN BE MY OWN CLIENT
KIT VALUATION OF SIXTY NINE
VERY CLEAN AND FRESH
ANOTHER BEDROOM HERE
YOU'RE ALWAYS GIVING MONEY AWAY
FIRST AND FOREMOST
I' BE STRETCHED TOO FAR
I THINK IT'S BUYER BEWARE ON THIS
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IT ENDED UP COSTING MORE
I SUGGEST THE TOP VALUATION COULD BE IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY
DEPENDING ON THE FINISH
THIS IS A BUNGALOW IN A NICE AREA FOR RETIREMENT
MAYBE SOME ADJOINING TIMBERS WILL HAVE TO GO
THE IDEA IS TO MOVE
WE WERE LOOKING TO INVEST IN PROPERTY
WHAT HE WAS DOING
THAT'S HALF THE BATTLE
YOU'VE DONE THIS MANY TIMES BEFORE
WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GUIDE PRICE OF THE PROPERTY
IT ALSO HAS A SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT SHOPS
I WOULD KEEP THIS AS THREE FLATS RATHER THAN ONE HOUSE
WE HAVEN'T DECIDED
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A FLAT DOWNSTAIRS
YOU ARE GOING TO MAXIMISE THE POTENTIAL OF THIS BUILDING
TO PLACE CORRECT PRICE
RATHER THAN A MISMATCH OF BEDROOMS AND AND LIVING ACCOMMODATION
THIRD BEDROOMS A LOT OF PEOPLE DO LIKE
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY GOOD
ALSO GIVES ME THE IDEA THAT THIS IS A SLIGHTLY WIDER TERRACE THAN THAN SOME
WHICH AGAIN IS GOOD NEWS
YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT YOUR MARK ON IT AND MAKE OF IT WHAT YOU WILL
THIRTY SIX IS BID ON THE AISLE
AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE WE WE CAN GET A GREEN LIGHT AND THEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN
WE ARE QUITE AMBITIOUS ABOUT THIS FLAT
YOU CAN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT THE PROPERTIES DOWNSTAIRS AS THEY ARE STILL BEING DONE
LI MEMBERSS OF THE WI
SITTING DOWN TO THIS
I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE MORE SPECIAL
IT JUST DOESN'T DELIVER
THE QUALITY OF THE COOKING
AND I WILL STAND BY THOSE TENS FOR ALL ETERNITY
SEREHETI IS IN TROUBLE
IF YOU TAKE AWAY FIRE AND YOU TAKE AWAY PASTIST
GOING BACK MAYBE TWO HUNDRED YEARS
THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN PRIMARI AND THEY WOULD BE PRIMARIES AGAIN ONCE THE POPULATIONS OF
ON SOME OCCASIONS
AS MANY AS A HUNDRED LIONS WERE SHOT IN ONE TRIP
THAT HUMANS CAN'T EXIST ALONGSIDE NATURE AND THAT HUMANS ARE ALWAYS A THREAT
AND THAT NATURE NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED FROM THEM
AND THAT REALLY SETS UP THIS DICHOTOMY
BECAUSE THAT'S ACTUALLY WHERE THE WILD BEAST GO AT THE WORST TIME OF YEAR
WHICH THEN BECAME THE BASIS OF A TOURIST INDUSTRY
WHICH ROSE TO NUMBER ONE IN THE EXPORT ECONOMY
YOU REALLY DO HAVE TO MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS
IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE HOUSING LAND SUPPLY
THE REVITALISATION OF THE TOWN CENTRE
WE THINK THIS PLACE SHOULD BE REDEVELOPED
AND IF I'M NOT THERE
AND WHEN HE'S NOT AROUND
IT HASN'T GOT PLANNING YET
SO SIMPLY WORK
WHAT CAN YOU BUILD ON HERE
I WOULD BUY THESE ZO DAY LONG IF THEY KEPT ON COMING UP
IT'S A MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY
LIFE IS A GAMBLE
POS I DON'T SEE IT AS A GAMBLE I
YOU GET TO FEEL
I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A SALAD
MY SALARY COMES AT THE END
THIS IS THE LAST ONE FOR ME
BUT SO THIS IS MY EXIT
I RECKON THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS PROPERTY IS ENORMOUS
THE SITE IS A DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY
A LOT OF THE HARD WORK HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE HERE
SO WE WANTED SOMEONE
HE'S HE'S BEEN BEFORE
A PURPOSE BUILT BUNGALOW FOR PAUL UM WITH LIVING ACCOMMODATION UPSTAIRS FOR CARERS
SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY
THE SAME FOOTPRINT SIZE AS THE TWO
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS VIABLE
THIS IS THE LAST ONE FOR ME THEN IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO AND START ENJOYING LIFE
SO THIS IS MY EXIT
I'D GO WITH WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN PASSED AND I'D START BUILDING THOSE TWO SEMI DETACHED BUNGALOWS
WHICH MIGHT SUIT SOMEBODY WHO
WHICH OBVIOUSLY REQUIRES GOING TO MERCHANTS AND THE ARCHITECTS AND STUFF
AND FROM THE OUTSIDE
TO SEE IF IT'S GOING TO BE EASY OR NOT TO PUT THAT DOT IN
AND THEN IT'S JUST GOING TO COME DOWN TO A QUESTION OF COST
AND HOW MUCH WILL IT ADD TO THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY
IT'S GOT THE BASICS HERE
IT'S DOUBLE GLAZED
A GENERAL SCHEME OF DECORATION
REALLY NOTHING TO DISLIKE ABOUT THIS BUNGALOW
APART FROM POSSIBLY THE DECOR
AND WITH SIMILAR PROPERTIES SELLING FOR AROUND THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
IF IT WAS BOUGHT FOR ANYTHING LIKE THAT NINETY FIVE
THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE
JUST SEE HOW THINGS GO
CAN THEY DO IT FOR NINE THOUSAND
TIME WAITS FOR NO MAN
AND THE WEEKS AND MONTHS HAVE PASSED
ALL THE NEIGHBOURS
AND THEREFORE I WOULD SUGGEST AN INITIAL ASKING PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND
IT'S RELATIVELY NEUTRAL
THAT'S IT FOR NOW
SO JACK IS THERE ALREADY WITH ME
THIS HAS BEEN BLOWTORCHED
IT'S MISSING THAT LOVELY
THESE LAST TWO DISHES
THAT'S EITHER GOING TO BE COMPLETELY AMAZING OR A TOTAL DISASTER
AND IF I AM GOING TO A BANQUET
IT HAS TO BE THE ONE FOR THE W
NOW FOR THE FISH COURSE
I THINK IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT
NOW THAT SEEMS QUITE REASONABLE TO ME
FIRST AND FOREMOST
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT
HAVE YOU GOT ANY IDEAS
BUT I DO LIKE TO LOOK BACK AT THE PROPERTY BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE SOME THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T SEE FROM THE
THE POINT IS NOT GREAT AT ALL
TABLE AND CHAIRS
SMALL RENOVATION JOB
AND YOU COULD MAKE A FEW QUID IF YOU BODY UP TO RENT
BUT ITS END VALUE WILL ALWAYS BE LIMITED UNTIL THAT SHORT LEASE IS EXTENDED
WHO WANTED TO TAKE IT ON
WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
SO WHAT I LIKE IS THE CONDITION IS NOT THAT BAD
PROPERTY DEVELOPING AND MAKING THINGS
AND WE'RE WORKING FOR SOMEONE ELSE
THERE IS A CHANCE THEY CAN REFUSE IT
I WOULD THINK AROUND TEN
GET RID OF ALL THE SURFACE DEBRIS
YOUR FIRST PROPERTY BUY
BUT NOT BAD AT ALL
BUT I THINK HE'S GOT HIMSELF A GOOD RENTAL FLAT
GET THE OLD RUBBER GLOVES ON
BUT WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE
IT'S A GREAT SPACE FOR LONDON
THERE MUST BE A REASON WHY
AND USUALLY THAT TRANSLATES INTO AN ISSUE OF SOME DESCRIPTION
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS FLAT WENT TO AUCTION WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE IT HAS A VERY SHORT LEASE OF
IT'S QUITE FRIGHTENING
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
BUT I'VE ENJOYED IT
I'VE HAD A LOOK AROUND
IT'S NICE AND EASY
THEY RAN IT FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS
BUT APART FROM THAT
AND THEY THEY DO COME UP
AND I DO LIKE THEM YOU KNOW
NOT BEING AT ALL SHORT SIGHTED
AND THE ONLY POTENTIAL HICCUP COULD BE THE PROBLEMS WITH THAT CHIMNEY
ESPECIALLY IN THE CONSERVATION AREA
HOPEFULLY IT'S GOING TO CHANGE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
IT'S PROBABLY A BIT ABOVE WHAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT IN THIS AREA ACTUALLY
SO IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO AFFECT THE VALUE SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF TWENTY FIVE THIRTY THOUSAND
WITH AN EXTENDED LEASE
I BELIEVE THE PROPERTY COULD ACHIEVE IN A REGION AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE
WITH THE LEASE EXTENDED TO POSSIBLY ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE YEARS
IT SAYS IN THE LEGAL PACK THAT WHOEVER BUYSS HAS TO REPAY THE COUNCIL FOR THE MONEY FOR THOSE REPAIRS
IT WOULD SELL FOR BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND TEN
AND SHE FELT SO STRONGLY THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO START THE NATIONAL
THEN I'M CONFIDENT
FROM MY GRANDMOTHER
AND ALSO THE REVIVAL OF BRITISH FOOD
I SHALL STILL BE IN BED
THEY GET TRAPPED BY SOME WOMAN
MISS SUCH AN EXPENSIVE ENGAGEMENT RING
CONTINUE TO BROWSE
I DO LIKE THAT IN A PERSON
WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE
AND I ALWAYS KEEP A FEW BARGAINS FOR THOSE WHO ARE SOCIALLY SUPERIOR
I CAN'T SEE MY GREAT FRIEND
NORMALLY BY THIS TIME
I LIKE TO KEEP MY LITTLE SECRETS
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT IT COMES FROM
TO BE YOUR BASIC COFFEE
SOMETIMES A PAIN
YOU'D HAVE A LIFETIME OF SHELTER WITH MADGE
I WAS LEFT WITH CHILD
THE WORLD'S GONE PAST HAPPY ENDINGS
LUNCH AND DINNER
DON'T LEAVE HALF OF YOU OUTSIDE
WHAT DO YOU WANT NEW CLOTHES FOR
WE SHOULD HAVE A BIT OF A CEREMONY
I BELIEVE THERE ARE THINGS OF NO MORTAL FLESH AND BLOOD
FORETELLING THE FUTURE NOW
PLEASE REMAIN SEATED
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
BECAUSE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WE WERE REALLY AT THE TIPPING POINT BETWEEN THE TURBO
IN THE NORMAL CARS
AND ALL THE OTHERS CLOSED UP
SO WHEN THE RACE STARTED ON THE SUNDAY
WATSON AND LOUD
BUT FROM SHEPHERD'S BUSH
THE JAPANESE GRAND PRIX
AND THE RESULT OF THAT WAS
AGAINST THE SORT OF OPPOSITION THAT RAHAM WAS FACING
AS YOU WELL KNOW
REALLY GOOD RACE TO FINISH ON
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL OF THOSE MOMENTS
WHERE FANS OF MIDDLE EARTH HAVE GATHERED
DIED WHEN HE WAS TWELVE
IN THE PERSON OF JESUS AND NOT THROUGH OUR OWN EFFORTS
THIS NEXT HIM COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT
AN EXILED KING WITH HEALING
BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT
THAT IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN THE FARMING COMMUNITY
MORE THAN FIFTY FARMERS KILL THEMSELVES
THAT'S AN AVERAGE OF ONE A WEEK
AND THAT WAS HIM TRYING TO HIDE THE THE THE FEELINGS THAT HE WAS OBVIOUSLY STILL
IT WAS JUST A CULMINATION OF EVERYTHING AND
MAYBE IT IS TIME FOR A CHANGE
LATER IN THE PROGRAM
IT ABSORBS HEAT FROM THE SUN DURING THE DAY AND IT KICKS IT OUT AT NIGHT
IT ALSO PREVENTS COLD WINDS FROM ENTERING THE GARDEN
IT CREATES A MICROCLIMATE
AND BECOME SWEET ENOUGH
SO THEY TEND TO BE FOR JAMS
MAYBE IT TASTES THE SAME
ARE VERY PRONE TO FASHION
MAYBE TODAY THIS WILL BE IN FASHION
BUT TEN YEARS FROM NOW
IT WON'T BE ANY MORE
A DIRECT LINK TO OUR HERITAGE
SO FOR ANYBODY WHO'S NEVER MADE JAM BEFORE
THESE FEELINGS OF DESPERATION CAN SOMETIMES TURN INTO SUICIDAL THOUGHTS
AND OFF THE BACK OF THAT
THAT WAS MY GOAL ACHIEVED
AND THEN WE PUT STATES OF ANXIETY
THAT WAS REALLY MOVING
YOUNG FARMERS ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA
IT WON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
BUT IF THEY CAN ACHIEVE THAT CULTURE CHANGE
AND AN EYE OPENER ABOUT HOW QUICKLY PEOPLE FROM AN ORGANISATION LIKE THE YOUNG FARMERS
WHICH YOU TEND TO THINK OF AS BOLD AND BRASH AND JOLLY
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING
AND THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE ANIMALS THAT CALL THIS PLACE THEIR HOME
IT'S PROBABLY BEEN HERE FOR A COUPLE OF THOUSAND YEARS
HOW DID YOU REACT WHEN YOU HEARD THAT THAT BAT WAS HERE
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER HAS IN STORE FOR YOU
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS GO INTO LINE OF WORK
THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT TIME FOR
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S THERE
I'VE GOT IT IN THE BAKERY
TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST
THIS IS WHERE YOUR CAR WAS BORN
IT'S BEEN BANKRUPT AT LEAST SEVEN TIMES
IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE FOR YOU TO TAKE THIS ON BOARD
EQUIVALENT CLOSE TO A MILLION
IT REALLY WASN'T ABOUT MAKING MONEY
TEST MARTIN REALLY HASN'T BEEN ABOUT MAKING MONEY FOR MANY YEARS
LIONEL BROUGHT THE MONEY
I WOULD SUGGEST
UM THE POPE WAS IN THERE AT THE TIME
I THINK AS MUCH AS THIS WILL BE AN ICON OF ITS TIME
INCLUDING YOU AND ME
MADE FROM WHOLEMEAL FLOUR
THEY WERE INDESTRUCTIBLE
THESE WERE A STAPLE OF A SAILOR'S DIET
SO IN ORDER TO FEED HIS FAMILY
AND SO AND ONE OF THEM
AND IT'S VERY IMMEDIATE
WHERE FROM THAT BEFORE THAT
A GOLDEN LAMP IN THERE
I WOULD LOVE THIS
ALMOST NOTHING ABOUT THE HISTORY
I'VE EVEN HAD A FEW RAISED EYEBROWS WHILE SELECTING
HOW DO YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JAPANESE AND CHINESE
AND WE KNOW THAT THE PICTURE EXISTS SOMEWHERE
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE THOUGHT
AND SHE WAS AN EXTREMELY WEALTHY WOMAN
IT'S GOT NO MARKS
FROM THE ANTIQUES ROHOW TEAM HERE AT ROYAL WILLIAM YARD
THE WHITSUN WEDDINGS
AN ARUNDEL TOMB WITH ITS MEMORABLE LAST LINE
SEVEN YEARS AFTER HE DIED
EACH ONE LABELLED
IT WAS A BOOKISH HOME WITH QUITE RACY WORKS BY OSTRA WILDE AND DH LAWRENCE ON THE
LARKIN ONCE WROTE TO A FRIEND THE ONLY MARRIED STATE I INTIMATELY KNOW
THAT OF MY PARENTS
THE FATHER TAUGHT THE SON NEVER TO BELIEVE IN GOD
WRITTEN VERY MUCH UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF W H AUDEN
AND LOOK AT THIS REPORT
IT'S A COLLEGE LIBRARY BOOK
I WASN'T MEANT TO STUDY BUT TO BE STUDIED
AND WAS MORE THAN PLEASED WITH HIMSELF
HOW CLEVER I AM NOW
WHO HAS A PASSIONATE LESBIAN CRUSH ON MARY
SHE CAST AWAY PRUDENCE AND UNDID IT AND THEN ANOTHER
AND HER RATHER SINISTER OLDER CHUM
WHOSE FIRST OBSERVATION WAS
HE LOOKS LIKE A SNORER
LARKIN INTRODUCED ME TO MO
THEY ALSO REFLECT THE TROUBLED SEXUAL LIFE THAT THE PAIR HAD
AND THEY ARE HAUNTED
AND THROUGHOUT EVA'S LONG WIDOWHOOD
THE BITTERNESS AGAINST HER WHICH HE EXPRESSED IN LETTERS TO MONNIICA AND THE OTHER FRIENDS
LOVE SONGS IN AGE OR
AND HE WAS VERY GOOD AT IT
WITH ORGANISATIONAL SKILLS INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER
LARKIN LIKED BEING A LIBRARIAN
AND TO REMIND HIMSELF OF THEIR POPULARITY
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
HE NEVER WANTED TO BE THE POET OF SOME METROPOLITAN LITERARY SALON AND HE DESPISED THOSE
BUT ALSO WITH SUCH WARMTH
DANCING AROUND WITH JOY
MUSIC BLARING FROM THE RECORD PLAYER
LARKIN BEGAN A MONTHLY COLUMN ABOUT JAZZ FOR THE DAILY TELEGRAPH
HARDY TAUGHT HIM SIMPLICITY OF LANGUAGE
WHICH IS TO BE FOUND HERE IN NOTEBOOK NUMBER FOUR
THE GREAT POETIC MENTOR AND HERO FOR LARKIN WAS THOMAS HARDY
IT BEGAN AS A JOURNEY IN JULY
MO WAS VERY UNHAPPY
SHE WAS VERY MUCH UPSET
I SEE IT WAS WRITTEN IN JUNE NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN
THE SUMMER OF LOVE
THE POEM MOVES TOWARDS A DREAMY
FACED WITH ALL THIS
LARKIN SAT DOWN AND PENNED THAT SAVAGE BUT HAUNTINGLY HONEST POEM
BECAME INCREASINGLY FRAIL
LET'S TRY ENOCH FOR A BIT
DO I FIND MYSELF
AND AT THE SAME TIME
AND HE WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY PROUD OF IT BECAUSE
WE FIND HE'S SENT IT TO QUITE A NUMBER OF HIS CHUMS
IS ONE OF THE REASONS HE'S SUCH A POPULAR WRITER
MANY PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD WHO BELIEVE THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE DEAF
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE NOT TO BE ABLE TO WRITE ANY MORE
ON TOP OF ALL THAT
MONITORS SO ILL
SHE WANTS TO COME AND LIVE HERE
I DIDN'T REALLY GET THE HANG OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT
WE BOTH WANT IT
WHICH GAVE HIS POETRY SUCH POWER
HE SPOKE OF THE HUMAN CONDITION
AND THE MESS WE MAKE OF THOSE NEEDS
WHAT WILL SURVIVE OF PHILIP LARKIN
AND I HAVE NO DOUBTS WHAT WILL SURVIVE
HE WASN'T A MODERNIST
MORE THAN ANY OTHER BRITISH WRITER OF THAT DATE
WHERE DO YOU GO TO FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING
DID THE BUYERS ON TODAY'S SHOW GET THEMSELVES A BARGAIN OR NOT
IT IS AS BAD AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT
AND STUFF LIKE THE ELECTRICS
IF YOU WERE TO RESTORE THIS PLACE
THINGS LIKE THE PIPE WORK
IF THEY DECIDED TO DO THE THE LOFT CONVERSION
AND PERHAPS PUT A CONSERVATORY ON THE BACK
THAT COULD TAKE THE VALUE UP TO BETWEEN NINETY
AND THIS IS WHERE MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE
BUT THEY'RE NOT FOR THE INEXPERIENCED
YOU DO NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
SO THAT IS GREAT NEWS
IN LACK OF LIVING SPACE
IT MAKES YOU THINK
THERE IS A DRAIN UNDERNEATH THIS PLOT OF LAND AND
AND THAT COULD PROVE TO BE A HUGE DRAIN ON YOUR BUDGET
I'VE GOT A BIT OF A RESERVATION
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE'RE LOOKING MORE FOR PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE OR PEOPLE WITH OLDER CHILDREN
WE'VE HAD THREE VERY BAD YEARS
COMES WITH FULL PLANNING PERMISSION
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT PESKY DRAIN
IT DIDN'T CUT SOMEBODY OFF
I RECKON IT'S GOING TO BE AROUND AROUND THE FOUR HUNDRED MARK
IF YOU'VE GOT VERY YOUNG CHILDREN
THAT IS QUITE HARD GOING UP AND DOWN THEM ALL THE TIME
WITH OVER FORTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE BUILDING A WHOPPING FOUR
YOU CAN SEE HOW OUR FATHER AND SON TEAM DO LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
USING ALL OF TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY
WELL I'M SURE THEY WILL MAKE A SUCCESS OF THIS
THE ONLY ISSUE IS THAT DRAIN UNDERGROUND
IT'S AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY
IT WAS JUST THE SAME OLD
SHE'S NOT VERY GOOD MOBILITY
I DID THINK ABOUT SIX MONTHS
UM AND ATTRACT OFFERS IN THAT REGION
THIS IS CALLED A LANE
UM BUT I WILL DO MY BEST
AH PROBABLY WORTH ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND
THIRD AND FINAL TIME
WHAT IS QUITE USEFUL
I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S QUITE SPACIOUS
AND THE RIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF TOWN
HE LIVES ABROAD
A LOT OF PROPERTY FOR THE MONEY
AND I DON'T THINK IT WOULD NECESSARILY COST TOO MUCH TO GET THIS PLACE SORTED OUT
OBVIOUSLY RECONVERT INTO TWO FLATS FOR MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AND PROFIT
HOW WILL ANITA AND HER PARTNERS GET ON SORTING THIS PLACE OUT
CONVERTING IT BACK INTO TWO FLATS
ALL SEEMS PRETTY MUCH LIKE IT'LL GO TO PLAN
YOU JUST NEVER KNOW
WALKED IN AND SAID
THEY DO THE FRONT NICELY WITH PAVING
IN TOWN CENTRE
WE KNEW WE'D HAD A WATER LEAK IN THE WALL FROM THE PROPERTY ABOVE
THEY FOUND THAT WE HAD RISING DAMP
BUT WE HADN'T COUNTED IN THE DAPRO COURSE
WHICH HAS ACTUALLY BEEN OUR BIGGEST BILL FOR BOTH PROPERTIES
STORMY SEAS AND UNPREDICTABLE WEATHER CAN OFTEN MEAN THAT ISLAND LIFE IS
WHICH IS WHY I'M TAKING THE PLANE
EVERYTHING TAKES PLACE IN THERE CHECK IN
DESPITE ITS DIMINUTIVE SIZE
IT'S ALSO A VITAL STOPPING OFF POINT FOR MIGRATING BIRDS AND THERE ARE MORE RARE SPECIES
AND THAT WAS OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO
REALLY UP UNTIL THE LAST TIME SHE SAILED SHE WAS CARRYING ONE HUNDRED
I DIDN'T BELIEVE THEY COULD BE REAL PLACES
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL
AND THAT IS QUITE IMPOSING
AND OF COURSE IN MANY WAYS IT IS
WHERE MYSTICS AND HOLY MEN SOUGHT REFUGE TO CONTEMPLATE THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE
WHEN A KING DIED
KINGS OF THE WESTERN PICTS
WE HAVE A VERY SMALL WORLD AROUND US
IT'S FULL OF EXOTIC
DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS
THEIR MINDS TURN NATURALLY
THE POPULATION EXPLODES
THEY'LL TAKE SOME HOME ANYWAY
ORAN CAME FROM IRELAND
AROUND THE BASS ROCK TO THE ISLE OF MAY
THINGS GOT SO BAD
THE MONKS ABANDONED THE ABBEY AND THE ISLAND
BUT NOWHERE IS SAFE DURING WAR
THEY ALSO ARGUED THAT BECAUSE WE ARE ALL DESCENDANTS OF ADAM AND EVE
BUT SINCE NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD ANCIENT HEBREW BEFORE
AND WHEN THE CHILDREN WERE EVENTUALLY RETURNED TO CIVILIZATION
NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND A WORD THAT THEY SAID
SO IT WAS NEVER RECIPROCATED
BUT BEFORE THAT TIME
VERY FEW PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS KNEW MUCH ABOUT SKYE AT ALL
AND NOTHING BUT THE BAD ROADS
IT WASN'T USUAL FOR GENTEEL LADIES TO HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTERED
BY HER LANGUAGE
BY THE COUNTRYSIDE
SHE ONLY SPOKE GALIC
SHE HAD NO ENGLISH
AFTER DECADES OF DENIAL ON THEIR PART THAT SUCH A THING WAS POSSIBLE
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
I WOULDN'T GIVE
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN ALL THIS STUFF WE BOUGHT
I THOUGHT OF YOU FIRST
AND FOR THIS SENSATIONAL OFFER
DOGS COVER THEIR EYES
YOU COULD START A MUSEUM
IF YOU'RE SUDDENLY SO TECHNICAL
PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT
SHE'S GOT HER OWN SECRET POWERS
IT'S THE VEIL THAT WORRIES ME
IT WAS IN TROUSERS
SHE'S GOT TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IF SHE GAZES TOO HARD AT ANYBODY
PAYING YOUR BILLS
MONDAY WILL BE PIZZA
BECAUSE THE CHILDREN ARE AT SWIMMING
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
THEY SAID THEY WANT TO MOVE HOUSE
IT'S WHAT YOU KNOW
I DON'T THINK SO AT ALL
IN LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE MINUTES
I KNOW THEY HAD DIFFERENT TASTES
THE BIG QUESTION IS
YOU KNOW AUTUMN HAS REALLY ARRIVED WHEN THE APPRENTICE APPEARS BACK ON OUR SCREENS
WHICH RUNS THROUGH TO CHRISTMAS
STARTED ON BBC ONE ON TUESDAY NIGHT
AND NO SOONER HAS BAKE OFF ENDED THAN ANOTHER COMPETITION BEGINS
WILLIAM AND HARRY
THAT BIT REALLY THAT REALLY GOT ME
SOMETHING THAT IS ALWAYS WELCOME HERE AT POINTS OF VIEW HQ
AND THAT IS ABOUT IT FOR THIS WEEK
THANKS TO ALL OF YOU WHO TOOK THE TIME TO GIVE US YOUR VIEWS
POSITIVE OR OTHERWISE
WHEN THE SPEAKER IS BILINGUAL
LIKE MR CABRERA
LIKE JOHN D WILLIAMS
WHAT ABOUT SOME SEXUAL TENSION
AS WE HAD IN A RECENT EDITION OF HORIZON TITLED WHICH UNIVERSE ARE WE IN
WE ASKED THE BBC'S OFFICIAL DEPARTMENT FOR SUCH THINGS
THE FAMOUS PRONUNCIATION UNIT
CAROLINE AHERNE ON POUND SHOP WARS BEING A PRIME OFFENDER
AND THEY CONFIRMED IT WOULD BE NORMAL PRACTICE TO USE THE ANGLICISED VERSION OF WORDS
WHICH DOES LEAD US SEAMLESSLY TO OUR NEXT ITEM
AND THE UPLIFTING STORY OF HOW ONE YOUNG BOY
SO WE AVOID PARIS AND RESTAURANT
SUCH POSITIVITY AND DETERMINATION SHOWN THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE
REALLY WELL DONE
YOU CAN PRAY IN A SUPERMARKET
SOMEBODY COULD TELL ME TO BE QUIET
AS FAR AS THIS APPLE IS CONCERNED
MATT IS DOWN SOUTH
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN A MONEYMAKER
AT TODAY'S PRICES THE NET SORT OF ADDITIONAL BENEFIT WOULD BE AROUND EIGHT
AH LAST YEAR'S CALENDAR WAS A RECORD BREAKER
WITH YOUR HELP AND THAT OF THE HAPPY HEDGEHOG
COLDS AND STOMACH COMPLAINTS
SO WHEREVER YOU ARE
THAT CONTAINS ANYIN
SO IDEALLY A WET LATE SPRING
YOU AND I WON'T SEE IT
THEY CAN BE FOUND IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK
NOT JUST THE MOST EXPENSIVE RESTAURANTS
ACTUALLY COMES FROM THE WORD FOR KIDNEY
AND ISN'T THAT A GREAT DESIGN
AND I WOULD LOVE IT TO HAVE BEEN PAINTED BY TURNER
BECAUSE THERE'S AN IDENTICAL ONE IN THE TATE
AND WHEN HE SOLD THE ONE IN THE TATE
BUT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
AND I THOUGHT I'D FIND A BIT MORE ABOUT IT
VASES LIKE THIS
POUNDS BUT IT'S THESE CRAZY
I THINK THEY'RE FANTASTIC THINGS AND THEY MIGHT NOT BE EVERYBODY'S CUP OF TEA
IT'S BASED ON HIS SELF PORTRAITRA OF SEVENTEEN FORTY FIVE
BOTH IN THIS COUNTRY
LIKE A WEDDING ALBUM
OR THE LAY PREACHER
MUCH TO MY SURPRISE
AND I DON'T THINK THERE HAD REALLY BEEN ANY NATURAL HISTORY FILM MADE IN MADAGASCAR AT ALL
THE FEMALE WAS SITTING ON HER BOTTOM ON THE BRANCH
AND IT'S THAT HONEYTU
RUM AND OTHER THINGS
SPIRITUALLY CONNECTED TO THE GEYSERS
SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL SHEEPPEATERS
THE ONES THAT HAD THE MOST POWERFUL MEDICINE
WHAT WE NEED AN EQUIVALENT OF EUROPEAN SUBLIME
IT HAD NO SUPERINTENDENT
SEE THE WONDERS
WRITE HOME ABOUT THEM
AND THEY HAVE A RATIONALE FOR IT
THOUSAND ELK IN ONE WINTER
AND WHAT WAS THEIR IMPACT ON THE ECOSYSTEM
ARE YOU GOING HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NOT
IF YOU SAY SOMETHING LIKE
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
AND MATRON LED THEM
IT WAS THE ROMANS
SHE IS THE MY FAIR LADY OF THE NURSERY RHYME
TAKING TRADE AWAY
YOU WOULD YOU WOULD OBJECT
DID OBJECT TO THAT BRIDGE
AND WAS BUILT BEFORE COLUMBA ARRIVED ON IONA
COUNTERTERROR POLICE TRY TO TRACE THREE MISSING SCHOOLGIRLS FROM EAST LONDON WHO ARE HEADING FOR
WHERE THE WOMEN
SO WE RESPECT THAT OPINION
WE ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER AND WHETHER THE COMMUNITY IS DOING ENOUGH
AND WE HAVE SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN
I REMEMBER SOMEONE TOLD ME
WE WERE AFRAID TO GO ON THE OTHER SIDE
BUT THAT WASN'T THE CASE
HAVEN BEEN THERE AND
WE'VE GOT A BREAKTHROUGH
WE'VE GOT CONTACT
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A RULE WHERE
AND SO WHEN HE CAME
EVERYTHING IS ABOVE
THEY CAN'T PROVE WHETHER I AM
OF COURSE THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ATTRACTION FOR THEM TO GO SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY'RE FEELING WELCOMED
WHICH I DO NOT BUY ONE BIT
AND THATS ALMONDS
WITH THE CREAM IN THERE
WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT OUR BUTTERCREAM
AND FLAT AND RUN ACROSS
DO I NORMALLY LOOK LIKE A USED TEA BAG
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR NAME IS
I WERE UP FEEDING BABY
SOMEBODY WERE MOVING ABOUT
IF I TURNED THEM ON
I TELL YOU ARE
IT'S FROM MY LOCAL IDIOT
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
DON'T GIVE ME LOVE YA
I THINK I MARRIED ONE
YOU DID WELL THERE
I NEED A SMALL FRUIT LOAF
AND I'M ONLY INTERESTED IN A SMALL FRUIT LOAF
I KNEW YOU'D SAY NO
I COULD GO OFF ANY MINUTE
BUSINESS HERE IS TERRIBLE
LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT NOW
MADGE IS YOUR DESTINY
I'VE BROUGHT DOWN MANY A TEMPERATURE
SO THEY POSE NO THREAT AT ALL TO HUMANS
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER CREATURE THAT HAS A FAR MORE SINISTER WAY OF REACHING ITS NEXT VICTIM
RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THIS PARASITE COULD BE LYING DORMANT IN THE BRAINS OF ONE THIRD
WHICH VERY MUCH UPSETS ME
THEY CAN SMELL AN INFINITESIMALLY SMALL AMOUNT OF TNT FROM A METRE AWAY OR
THE EMERALD LAKE IS ONLY PART OF THE STORY BECAUSE FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR THE PLACE LOOKS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE SWIMMING AROUND IN THE PUDDLE
THEY'RE VERY MUCH OF THIS WORLD
SEX CHANGING INVERTEBRATE MASQUERADING AS A ROCK
THEY'RE VERY REAL
WHICH MEANS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO EXTINGUISHING THEM
IT CAN BE DISASTROUS
AS FAR AS THIS APPLE IS CONCERNED
MATT IS DOWN SOUTH
AT TODAY'S PRICES THE NET SORT OF ADDITIONAL BENEFIT WOULD BE AROUND EIGHT
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN A MONEYMAKER
LAST YEAR'S CALENDAR WAS A RECORD BREAKER
COLDS AND STOMACH COMPLAINTS
WHEN YOU WENT OUT INTO PONRA NIGHT
HERE IN PERTHSHIRE
SO WHEREVER YOU ARE
THROUGH THE SPRING AND THE SUMMER
YOU AND I WON'T SEE IT
THIS IS WHEN THE LIGHTS GO ON
HAVE YOUR SAY ON THE TV YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING OVER THE PAST WEEK
SHE WAS INTERRUPTED BY ONE OF THE PANELISTS
THOSE IN CHARGE AT SUNDAY MORNING LIVE HAVE DEFENDED PRESENTER SHAN WILLIAMS' HANDLING OF THE
SAYING SHE DEALT WITH THINGS PROFESSIONALLY AND APPROPRIATELY
THEY MAKE CLEAR THE QUESTION RAISED BY THE IMPROMPTU PROTEST WASN'T ONE FOR THE PROGRAMME
AND THE ASIA NETWORK
WHICH IS MORE OF A LIKE
ALMOST A FASHION MAGAZINE
IT WASN'T COVERED IN A SERIOUS WAY
I FELT IT I HAD TO BE THE VOICE FOR THE VOICELESS
THE BRITISH PUBLIC
EVEN FURTHER BACK
THAT IS A FIRST
AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR YOU TO INFLUENCE HOW THE BBC WILL LOOK IN THE FUTURE
I THINK WE'RE QUITE SPOILED
I THINK WE FORGET HOW MUCH IT OFFERS
FROM RADIO FIVE LIVE
IT WAS GREAT TV
THERE'S NOTHING ON IT FOR ME ANY MORE
SO THEY DON'T AIM TOO HIGH
SO YOU GET PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE GOING TO TURN OFF
OR NEVER EVEN SEEN INSIDE ONE
PLEASE DO SIT BACK
RELAX PROPERLY FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF
WITH A COUPLE OF NICE DRINKS
I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ACT BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT
AND I GUESS THAT WE ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN
REALLY BROUGHT TO LIFE THE EXPERIENCES OF SERVANTS THROUGHOUT PERSONAL ACCOUNTS
AND THIS MADE FOR A FASCINATING INSIGHT INTO THE REAL DOWNTON ABBEY
I'D LOVE TO SEE MORE PROGRAMMES LIKE THIS ON LATE MODERN HISTORY
YOU'VE HEARD THE PHRASE WATCHING PAINT DRY
DO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS COMING
THIS PROGRAMME DOES NOT EXIST
YOU KNOW HOW TO GET IN TOUCH
GO TO THE WEBSITE
SO I'M GOING TO BE GOING OUT WITH THE FISHERMEN
AND WHAT THAT DOES
WE FEEL HEALTHIER
FARMERS HAVE A KEY ROLE AND SHOULD BE AROUND THE TABLE IN THE DISCUSSION
AND WORKING WITH DOCTORS
PLANT BREEDERS AND AND LIVESTOCK BREEDERS
IT'S BETTER THAN IT WAS
AND COULD THERE BE A CATCH
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO LIVE
THIS IS THE HOME OF THE WELSH LANGUAGE
AND IT HAD BEEN LIKE THAT FOR GENERATIONS
NO MATTER HOW SMALL THE VILLAGE
SO WITH THE CURRENT CULTIVARS WE'VE GOT
BOTH AS INDIVIDUALS
EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOUR WORK'S ALL ABOUT
AND WE CAN TAKE THESE PHOTOS AND PUT THEM ON THE COMPUTER AND SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO A BUMBLEBEE
THEY'LL BE TETRACHROMATS
BUT THEY HAVE A WHOLE UV CHANNEL AS WELL
EVERY WEEK ON COUNTRY FILE
AH WE SEE ADAM AND HIS LOVE OF FARMING A PASSION WHICH HE INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER
ONE OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF THE RARE BREEDS SURVIVAL TRUST AND A GENTLEMAN WHO HAS APPEARED MANY
EARLIER THIS MONTH
JOE PASSED AWAY AND WITH ADAM AND HIS FAMILY'S PERMISSION
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOURS YET
HERE'S HOW YOU DO IT
WE'LL HAVE THE WEATHER FOR THE WEEK AHEAD BUT
BUT BEFORE THAT
A BIG THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS BOUGHT OUR COUNTRYFILE CALENDAR FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN
THIS TIME AROUND
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN BEAT THAT
THERE'S JUST TIME TO REMIND YOU OF A VERY SPECIAL PROGRAMME NEXT WEEK
THEIR DANCING SHOES JUST
SINGING HIS BRAND NEW SINGLE
WITH YOUR PERSONALITY
I AM SO GRATEFUL TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW VOTINGING FOR ME
THANK YOU SO MUCH
OTHER PEOPLE TOOK A GAMBLE
WE'VE HAD TO CATCH TO EAT
THE LOCAL PEOPLE WILL BE BETTER OFF BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT MORE MONEY TO SPEND AND EVERYBODY IS HAPPY
AND OUR SPECIALISTS NO DOUBT WILL LAY ON SOME ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR OWN AS THEY GREET OUR VISITORS
THAT IS A NICE SURPRISE
YOU LOOKED AFTER THE FIGURES BUT
ABOUT THREE OR FOUR YEARS
THEY JUST NOT WORTH AS MUCH AS THEY WERE PERHAPS TEN
NOW YOU KNOW ALL THAT
THE REICH THAT WAS GOING TO LAST A THOUSAND
WE KNOW THAT ANYTHING MODERN WAS DEGENERATE
IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO THINK THAT
AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY WERE MADE
TIME FOR OUR REGULAR FEATURE WHERE ONE OF OUR PROGRAMME EXPERTS PRESENTS US WITH A CHALLENGE
WHEN I WAS ASKED TO JOIN THE ANTIQUES ROAD
WE'D LOVE TO SEE THEM HERE
I KNOW RONNIE WOULD
SO BRING THEM ALONG
WHAT SHOULD WE BE LOOKING FOR
AND WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT
MISTAKEN FOR ONE
AND IF I SEE AN OPPORTUNITY
THE MORE MONEY THEY EARN
STOP THEIR BALL ON THE EDGE AND THEY' WILL GET THOUSANDS
I WORKED IN FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL SO I WORKED WITH KIDS
PRACTICE WAS OK ACTUALLY
AND YOU EARNED THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY
I KNOW THESE LANES ARE SO FAST
I HAVE TO GO WITH SIMILAR TO WHAT I DID THE LAST TIME
ANNA AND MAR
IT'S FIFTEEN YEARS OLD NOW ALMOST
MY BEST FRIEND AND I
I RECENTLY MOVED HOUSE
WE COULD DO WITH A BIT MORE IN THE WORLD FURNITURE
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL
I NEED TO TELL HER
DID YOU BUY A MEDICATION CALLED
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW
BUT HOWARD WANTED TO PUT THIS RIGHT
I'M FROM BRISTOL AND I TEACH ENGLISH AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE
THE MORE MONEY THEY HAD
STOP THEIR BALL ON THE EDGE AND THEY' WILL GET THOUSANDS
AND THEY GET NOTHING
BUT I DON'T WANT TO TEMPT FATE
I WORKED ON MECHANICAL ASPECTS AS A TECHNICIAN ON VARIOUS APLANES DURING MY TEN YEARS
THE THE TRISTARS OTHERWISE ON
WE HAD TO GO WITH THEM
BECAUSE I SPEAK SPANISH
NOW THAT I'VE SAID THAT
I'M A SPORTS NUT
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE SPORTS
SPEND FAR TOO MUCH OF MY SPARE TIME PLAYING OR WATCHING SPORTS
I'M IN TROUBLE ANYWAY
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO QUITE GET THERE
REACH THE EDGE AGAIN
AND THE CHANCES ARE IAN WON'T GET THE EDGE ANYWAY
DIDN'T WANT TO BE SHORT
IT'S BEEN AMAZING
BUT ALL THIS COULD SOON BE A THING OF THE PAST AND WE'LL BE FINDING OUT LATER ON IN THE SHOW
I WAS UNDER THE UNDERSTANDING IT WAS A MUSTARD POT
I'M A BIG SHELL COLLECTOR
LET'S HOPE THIS EIGHTY
FOR A NINE GALLON SIZE
THESE WOODEN CASKS HAVE BEEN MADE BY HAND SINCE ROMAN TIMES
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THOUSANDS
IT'S A TIGHTLY RUN SHIP AND
COMING LIVE TO YOUR TELLY BOX FOR THE NEXT HALF AN HOUR
THE BALLROOM WAS PRACTICALLY BURSTING AT THE SEQUENCE SEAMS WITH TALENT
SEND US YOUR VERSION OF THE STRICTLY
FLEX THOSE MUSCLES
SAD FACES HERE TODAY
EVERY QUEEN HAS CERTAIN DUTIES THEY MUST HONOUR
AND CHOREOGRAPHY QUEEN KAREN HARDY IS NO DIFFERENT
THIS MEANS SHE'S AWAY ATTENDING TO IMPORTANT SERVICES TO DANCE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS
KELLY AND KEVIN
SHE'S LEFT HER CHOREOGRAPHY CORNER IN VERY GOOD
SO NOTHING SCARY IN THE STUDIO AT ALL
THE LEVEL IS SO HIGH
I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING ABOUT ME AND GAVIN
SHE WAS A BEAUTY
BEING JADE'S BIOLOGICAL MOTHER WELL
THE POLICE KNOW EVERYTHING NOW
ONCE UPON A TIME
TIME'S FLYING BY
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THEM
WE BUILD OUR OWN BOATS
BECAUSE IT'S ON THE BASE
IF THIS CAME INTO MY AUCTION HOUSE
BECAUSE TIME'S UP
BUT FOR AN EXTREMELY SMART GARDEN
AND ORGANISE THE READINGS
ASK YOURSELF THAT
AND THERE IS BIT OF BOSOM SHOWING BUT
AND I'VE BEEN TO OVER THIRTY FIVE COUNTRIES
I'M AN ENGINEERING GRADUATE
AND I WORK FOR THE RAIL NETWORK
I'M TRISH FROM SKEGNESS
THE MORE MONEY THEY EARN
STOP THEIR BALL ON THE EDGE AND THEY'LL GET THOUSANDS
I COULD DO A LIST BUT
CHINA IS SO MUCH
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD OMEN
AND THAT WAS MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL
I THINK THAT'S MAYBE SLIGHTLY HOPEFUL
IF I TURN HIM ROUND
IF WE COMPARED IT TO CARS TODAY
THE COPPER ONES
FINGERS CROSSED IT HAS BEEN SPOTTED
HE HAD HIS UMBRELLA ON HIM
AND IT WAS RAINING AND
FUSED AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
BUT THAT SOUNDS ARROGANT
AND THEY ALSO MADE CUTLERY AND
IT'S WORTH THAT
SPARTAN I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED TODAY'S SHOW
THEY BELONG TO DAWN
I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE A FLASHING JUKEBOX THAT ONLY PLAYS SHORT EXCLUSIVE BURSTS OF MUSIC THAT
IT MUST BE TIME FOR TUNES ON TUESDAY
WE'VE GOT MUSIC
THEY'VE DONE THE DOUBLE AND SURVIVED THE DANCE OFF YET AGAIN
ONWARDS AND UPWARDS
YOUR BEST SCORE
ESPECIALLY ON THE FRIDAY
COMING UP NEXT BBC TWO ON B TWO IS FORMER STRICTLY FAVOURITE
BECAUSE THE MUSIC IS VERY FAST
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T SEE EXACTLY BUT ONCE THE BACKSLAB IS ON
HE CAN'T BE LEFT ALONE
STILL WAY TOO MUCH TO DO
WE NEVER GIVE UP
I'M ONE OF LIFE'S NATURAL PROBLEM SOLVERS
SOMETHING TO GIVE ONE HUNDRED
YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY WORK
I WAS MAKING A NEW LIFE HERE AND NOW YOU'VE
THAT WHAT WOULD BECOME KNOWN AS THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION HAD IN FACT BEEN AN ILLEGAL AND TREACHEROUS
EXCITED ABOUT CHANGE
AND WITH THE PROSPECT OF AN ENGLISH FLEET BEARING DOWN ON HIM
NOT A DEAD ROYAL MARTYR
WAS DEMANDING HIS MILITARY POSITION BE MADE PERMANENT AND WAS BEHAVING AS THOUGH HE WERE KING
THE VERY PARTY THAT HAD MASTERMINDED HIS FAMILY'S DOWNFALL HAD BEEN WIPED OUT AT THE POLLS
WHILE MANY OF THE TORIES NOW IN POWER ACTIVELY FAVOURED A JACOBITE RESTORATION
THE END OF THE PROTESTANT STUART LINE WAS DRAWING NEAR
BRITAIN SEEMED ON COURSE TO HAVE A FOREIGN PRINCE WITH A VERY DISTANT CLAIM AS ITS NEW KING
WHILE THE NEXT IN LINE COULD ONLY WATCH FROM AFAR HERE IN LORRAINE
MAR THEN DELIVERED A STIRRING SPEECH TO THE GATHERED CROWD IN WHICH HE CLAIMED THAT HIS EYES HAD
AND THEN MEET UP WITH MAR'S LARGER ARMY
WHILE SOME AGREED
HAD THE APPETITE TO CARRY ON
WE'D MET BRIEFLY ONCE THROUGH A FRIEND AND I SAW HIM AFTERWARDS
THERE'S A LOT OF AND POLITICAL PLACEMENTS ON CAPITOL HILL
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO MAKE THAT IN AUCTION
AND CONTINUING THE THEME
I THINK NOTHING FIFTY
IF IT'S CANADIAN AND FIRST WORLD WAR PERIOD
WITH ROSS MERCER
SO THAT'S ANOTHER BODY BLOW
BUT YOU'RE STILL PLUS FORTY
PLUS TEN POUNDS ON THAT
YOU FINISH UP WITH PLUS TEN
I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP
THEY COULD SEE YOU TOMORROW AND A MIDWIFE FROM THE UNIT
THE MESSAGE DIDN'T GET PASSED ON
I'M DAVINA FROM WESTERN SUPER MARE AND I'M CURRENTLY A FULL TIME MUM
I'M MEG FROM SOUTHAMPTON
THE MORE MONEY THEY EARN
STOP THEIR BALL ON THE EDGE AND THEY'LL GET THOUSANDS
HAVING PEOPLE OVER
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL
MAY THEY LIVE LONG AND PROSPER FOR ANOTHER WEEK
LET'S SEE WHAT OUR WEREWOLF OF THE WALTZ THINKS
SO FROM THE VERY GET GO
IT JUST MEANS THE WORLD WHEN PEOPLE DO THAT
HE WAS THE FIRST MALE CELEBRITY TO TACKLE THE RUMBA ON SATURDAY AND THE GAMBLE PAID DIVIDENDS
AND I THINK HE HAD REALLY BEAUTIFUL SOFT ARMS
I KNOW IT SOUNDS REALLY BORING BUT
JOIN US TOMORROW WHEN GEORGIA AND GIOVANNI AND CAROL AND PASHA WILL BE SHARING SOME OF THEIR
BECAUSE THEY HAVE' BEEN UP THERE AT THE TOP
BLUE YOU CAN'T MASTER THE DANCE GE
GIVING US A PREVIEW OF THEIR DEVILISH PLANS FOR THIS WEEKEND'S HALLOWEEN LOOKS
IT'S A FILM SET HERE
HE IS A MAN WITH UNLIMITED MOVEMENT BUT
BUT HE IS A MAN ENTIRELY OUT OF THE POLITICAL CONTEXT
IT'S OF NO INTEREST TO BOND WHO
WE'RE PROUD TO PRESENT TONIGHT BYE BYE BONDY THE LATEST
WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT MY HOTEL
HE WANTS A WOMAN
THEY ARE VESSELS
WOMEN ARE BEING VERY BUSY
IF HE LOVES THE GIRL
AND THINGS LIKE THAT
THERE'S ONLY ONE JAMES BOND AND THAT'S ROGER MOORE
WHEN HE WAS GRAPPLING WITH YOU IN THE IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE
THERE'S A ROYAL PREMIRE TONIGHT
IT'S THE LATEST BOND
SO HAVE YOU TONIGHT ON NATIONWIDE SIX TWENTY
I'M ROGER MOORE
THE REAL ONE IN MANY PEOPLE'S EYES
NOT ROGER MOORE
THE PRETENDER WHO HAS USURPED THE ROLE FOR THE LAST TWELVE YEARS
BETRAY ALL OUR TRICKS
WITH THE STORY OUTLINE WE'VE GOT NOW WE HAVE
I WILL BE MORE BOND TOMORROW
BECAUSE I WANT TO PLAY M
BECAUSE SHE WAS THE BOSS
THE MOST ENTERTAINING FILM WE CAN
BUT IT'S A QUESTION OF TAKING IT SOMEWHERE
WHAT DO YOU LIKE DOING
AT HOME IN SWANSEA WILL BE MY HUSBAND
VERY SIM CHANCE HERE
WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME CRUISE HOLIDAYS LATELY
WELCOME TO FLOG IT FROM DUNSTABLE
THAT'S A LONG TIME
THERE IS COMMISSION TO PAY BUT
IT WAS THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE END OF TWO VERY DIFFERENT ROYAL MARRIAGES THAT HELPED SEAL
THEN THE PEOPLE WOULD BE VERY UPSET
COULD IT BE THE LOST MASTER
AWAY FROM THE ROOM

LORD OF THE DANCE

AMERICA IS MAINLY WITH WORK
TRYING TO MAKE THE PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT
BUT I'M PRETTY GOOD AT TENNIS
SO I EXPECTED MORE FROM MYSELF
THE ONLY THING IS THERE'S NO OUTBOARD MOTOR
FOR WE GIRLIE WEEKEND OR WHATEVER
I NEED A BIT OF A CONFIDENCE BUILDER
PUSHING THEMSELVES TO THE EDGE
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL
WHICH IS WHY YOU'VE GOT THIS WHITE IN THE GRAIN
VERY SIMILAR TO THIS
SO FORTH SO FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW
STAFFORDSHIRE BOASTS SOME THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POTTERIES
REDOWNED NAMES LIKELAR CLIFF
THEY MARCHED THE FIVE HUNDRED METRES FROM THE OLD PREMISES TO MORECROFT'S NEW FACTORY

WE'VE GOT AN UMBRELLA STAND WELL
A RATHER EXPENSIVE UMBRELLA STAND

LUCKY FOR YOU WE HAVE MANY EYES SPYING ON THEIR EVERY MOVE IN EVERY TRAINING ROOM
TOIL AND TROUBLE
IT MUST BE THE FRIDAY PANEL

THEY GOT THEIR FIRST NIGHTS OF THE SERIES

JUST RELAX MORE
FELT WHEN SHE CAME INTO TRAINING
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GET GUIDO TO BRING ON THE FOLLOWING
YOU CAN STILL USE IT
I DON'T FEEL LIKE DANCING TODAY
YOU'VE HAD A ROUGH NIGHT
THAT'S WHAT THE TRIAL HEARD TODAY
NATHAN MATTHEWS AND SHANA HA DENY MURDER
SHE WAS TRYING TO STOP A FIGHT IN AMERICA
THE US DETAINED HIM FOR NEARLY FOURTEEN YEARS BUT NEVER CHARGED HIM WITH ANYTHING
I'D GIVE IT FIVE MINUTES
MY GRANDFATHER TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT
AND D WILL SOMEHOW MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A DRESS
THEY COULD SCREAM
SO PLEASE WELCOME
JEREMY SAID HE WOULD NEVER
EVER DANCE LIKE A ZOMBIE AGAIN

EVIL CREATURES DWELL

WHAT BIG FINGERS I'VE GOT
AND AFTER JAY'S RETURN TO FORM LAST WEEK
AT THE END OF THIS ROUTINE WE MIGHT JUST BE SAYING MY
TAKE YOUR BRIDE UPSTAIRS
THEY'RE ALMOST READY TO DANCE
YOU NEVER SLACKENED
SO JANEETTE ORGANIZED A CAMPING TRIP
BUT WHEN PETER WENT DOWN TO THE WOODS
HE WAS IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE
PERFORMING IS FOR LIFE
THINGS WHERE THESE GUYS
IT'S PERFECT CASTING
HELEN STARSING CALL THE MIDWIFE SO SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT MUMMIES
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THERE
YOU ONLY TAKE THE FEELING
PATIENTS BLEED OUT
IT'S A BRAND NEW POLICE SERIES ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT ON BBC ONE
A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF BLOOD AND A BUNDLE OF BAD LANGUAGE
IF THESE SWEAR WORDS WERE USED IN DOCTOR WHO OR EASTENDERS
TO NAME BUT A FEW OFFENDERS
ITV HAVE BEEN HAVING THEIR OWN ISSUES WITH A DRAMA
WE CAN DO BETTER
I WAS STANDING NOT FAR AWAY AT THE TIME
THE ITALIAN JUDGE
THIS IS A FAMILY PROGRAMME
CLEAN UP YOUR ACT
YOU'RE SPOILING THE PROGRAMME
I DON'T WANT TO BE SEEING THAT WITH MY TEN AND ELEVEN YEAR OLD GRANDCH
WE DID ASK BUT WE WERE GIVEN A POLITE NO
SO WIDESPREAD HAS THE COVERAGE FOR SPECTRE BEEN THAT SOME OF YOU ARE ASKING IF THE CORPORATION HAS
IT SEEMS SIGNOR TONOLI WISHES IN THIS INSTANCE TO REMAIN SILENT
AND YOU WOULD NEED TO HAVE BEEN STUCK IN AN UNDERGROUND BUNKER OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS TO NOT HAVE
BBC THREE HAD A VERY PERSONAL AND MOVING DOCUMENTARY ON TUESDAY NIGHT WHICH SAW THE
IF YOU ARE WATCHING SOMETHING ON THE BBC AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR SAY
WHY IS HE ON SO MANY PROGRAMS
AND THAT IS IT FOR THIS WEEK
WE'LL BRING YOU THOSE RAMBLES AND THE INSPIRATIONAL YOUNGSTERS WHO JOINED US
SETTLED IN SCHOOL REALLY WELL
MADE SOME AMAZING FRIENDS
THEY DON'T NEED ME AS A TEACHER ANYMORE
YOU CAN STILL HELP
HE OPENED IT UP AND MADE IT AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE
AH YOU BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD DESERVES TO HAVE SOME COUNTRYSIDE IN THEIR LIFE AND A BIT OF JOY
THE PE DISTRICT WAS THE FIRST EVER NATIONAL PARK IN BRITAIN
IT'S A GREAT EVENT YOU KNOW
THERES SOME CHALLENGING PARTS BUT
I WISH I COULD BE WITH YOU TODAY
SO PLEASE DONATE WHATEVER YOU CAN TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE CAMERON AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER
EVEN THIS LOVELY
TO BE INDEPENDENT
EVEN IF IT'S JUST A POUND
YOUR VOTES HAVE BEEN COMBINED WITH THE JUDGES' SCORES
YOUR VOTES AT HOME MAY HAVE CHANGED ALL OF THAT
ELEVEN COUPLES DANCED FOR SURVIVAL ON SATURDAY BUT
IT'S JUST BEEN IT'S BEEN A HARD WEEK
WHO VOTED FOR US
MONDAY TO FRIDAY
I REALLY DO
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE A CYCLIST
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO USE NETS TO CATCH THEIR BAIT
THAT'S WHEN THE PREDATORY FISH
ALSO KNOWN AS A HAND LINE
I'M FEELING THE PRESSURE MORE THAN I HAVE IN ANY DAY THE WHOLE COMPETITION
WHICH IS WHY COPIES LIKE THIS ARE STILL IN PRINT TODAY
SO WHEN MY MOTHER WAS BORN
AND THE PIECES FIT IN FAIRLY WELL
AND ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF METALWORK WE SEE REASONABLY FREQUENTLY ON THE ROADSHOW ARE THE BIG SO
AND APPARENTLY SHE COULD WRITE TEN
THESE GREAT FRENCH ATTACKS
AND REALLY TOOK A LOT OF THE BRUNT OF THE FIGHTING
AND WHEN THEY ENGAGED
THEY WERE SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MEN
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG KID
ALMOST THE NORMALITY OF HATS
ORNAMENTS AND SO ON
MANY OF US DO MUCH OF OUR WRITING ON A KEYBOARD AND THE COMPUTER OR THE SMARTPHONE IS OUR PAGE
GO AND GRAB A PEN AND PAPER
BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY
BUT THE ACTUAL MATERIAL HAS SHRUNK AND MOVED
BUT THE QUALITY
WHICH I THINK WAS REFLECTED HEAVILY IN THE PRICE WE ACHIEVED
I HAD THE KEY IN MY HAND OPENING THE DESK
THEY CAN COME IN THE SHAPES OF RUGBY BALLS
COME THE SHAPE OF FOOTBALLS
THEY COME IN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DIFFERENT THINGS
A HOUSE CONTENTS
WHERE HE COLLECTED INKWELLS
READING A FAMILY MEMOIR IS LIKE HEARING A VOICE FROM THE PAST
BOTH OF THEM IN IN DIRECT
ITS THIS PLACE
ONCE HER BROTHER'S HOME
BUT THE WORK WAS A HUGE LEAP FORWARD IN COMPUTER DEVELOPMENT
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH JANE AUSTEN
IF YOU'VE GOT MILLIONS OF POUNDS TO SPEND DISPOSABLE CASH
YOU SPEND IT ON YOUR PASSION
THE PRESENT PHENOMENA OF THE INTERNET
LOOK AT THE COLLECTION
READ THE BOOKS AND LEARN MORE ABOUT EARLY WOMEN'S LITERATURE
AND WELL IF I HAD LOADS OF MONEY
IT'S WELL WORTH A VISIT
SO THOMAS WAS DELIGHTED TO MEET UP WITH SUE WHO BROUGHT ALONG SOMETHING RATHER SPECIAL TO A
SOMEBODY WHO DEFINITELY KNOWS HER BOOKS
IN THIS WEEK OF REMEMBRANCE
BECAUSE I WAS QUITE
OUR SPECIAL GUEST TODAY KNOWS ALL ABOUT THAT
HIS FATHER WAS IN THE ROYAL NAVY
BUT THE SEAMEN INVOLVED HAD TO CONTEND WITH WEATHER CONDITIONS BEYOND OUR IMAGINATION
AND THE EVER PRESENT RISK OF ATTACK
GO TO YOUR LIFEBOAT STATION NOW
TO MARK THE END OF THE MILITARY'S INVOLVEMENT
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE WEATHER THAT'S THERE
IF IT WAS BEING USED TO ATTACK SUBMARINES FROM ABOVE
AND IT WAS IN THAT ORDER
IT WAS WITH THE FRENCH ARMED FORCES AND THEN IT WAS ACTUALLY BEACHED IN FRANCE AND USED AS A BAR
IT'S A ONE MAN NAZI SUBMARINE
WE MADE THE SAFETY RULES
YOU CAN'T SHOOT THESE PEOPLE
IN ITS ROLE AS A MUSEUM
THERE ARE VERY FEW SURVIVORS OF THE TREACHEROUS CROSSINGS LEFT
HE FORGETS THINGS
WHILE I'M HERE WITH TIME ON MY HANDS
TWO MINUTES WILL BE FINE
THAT WILL BE WORSE
I'M A RETIRED SHOP MANAGER
I LIVE IN LONDON
I'M AN ARTIST AND I PLAY THE VIOLIN IN AN ORCHESTRA
THE MORE MONEY THEY EARN
STOP THEIR BALL ON THE EDGE AND THEY'LL GET THOUSANDS
I RECENTLY FINISHED A THIRTY YEAR CAREER IN MARKETING
I WAS BEST ON GREEN
I THINK I WAS TRYING TO BE
BUT MOSTLY AT THE MOMENT I'M WRITING FOR MYSELF
I LIVE IN NORTHUMBERLAND
ALMOST ALL OF MY WARDROBE COMES FROM CHA
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FINANCES TO HAVE THEM
BUT MAYBE THEY'LL BECOME LARGER STORIES
STILL NEED TO PUT MARK OFF
AFTER YOUR FIRST ROUND OF GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AND YOUR FIRST ROLL
ON THE WRITING SIDE
I NEED TO PULL MY SOCKS UP
YEAH WAS A BANKER
SO STAY WITH US AS WE WING OUR WAY THROUGH MANY OF THE EXHIBITS
THERE IS CERTAINLY NO TIME TO WASTE
LET'S FIRE UP THE ENGINES AND GET THE SHOW ON THE ROAD
THE PUNK IMPRESARIO MALCOLM MCLAREN AND THE AUTHOR OF THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY
ALL HAVE IN COMMON
IF THERE IS ENOUGH
IT'S HARDLY GLAMOROUS
AND THE MAN ON THE ROSTRUM IS WILLIAM ROUSE
I'M GOING INSIDE TO CATCH UP WITH OUR OWNERS
IF YOU ARE UNSURE
ASK A MEMBER OF STAFF
BUT IF YOU WIND BACK THE YEARS SOME TWO HUNDRED ODD OR SO
AUTHORS BURIED ALONGSIDE BARE KNUCKLE FIGHTERS
THERE ARE NO CLASS DISTINCTIONS HERE
THE CENSUS RECORDS SHOW US
THE CITY HAD A POPULATION OF NEARLY ONE MILLION PEOPLE
THAT POPULATION HAD DOUBLED
THE ANSWER WAS MORE PLACES OF BURIAL
HIGHGATE WAS ONE OF EIGHT CEMETERIES SET UP WITHIN A RING AROUND THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE
THIS WHOLE AREA WAS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF LONDON
AWAY FROM THE BURGEONING POPULATION
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY QUITE INDIVIDUAL
IT'S A PEACEFUL PLACE A PLACE OF CONTEMPLATION AND
THEY SAY TIME WAITS FOR NO MAN
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
I WOULD LIKE TO PUT IT IN AT SOMETHING LIKE TWO TO THREE HUNDRED
WE HAVE TO SAY FAREWELL AS IT'S OVER TO THE AUCTION ROOM FOR THE VERY LAST TIME TO PUT THOSE
EVERY ONE OF THESE AIRCRAFT TELLS A FASCINATING STORY OF OUR AVIATION HISTORY
I LOVE THE VIENNESE WALTZ
I PUT EVERYTHING INTO EVERYTHING I DO
AND IT SEEMS IT' EVEN SPREAD ACROSS THE POND
FOR MORE INFORMATION HEAD OVER TO THE STRICTLY WEBSITE
AND YOU POSTED A WONDERFUL VIDEO ONLINE THIS WEEK IN ANSWER TO A COUPLE OF YOUR CRITICS
JOINING US TOMORROW PETER ANDETTE AND DANCE OFF SURVIVORS FOR THE THIRD TIME
YOU WENT TO PRISON
BECAUSE YOU WERE OFF THE SCENE
WHICH IS WHY ITS SO GREAT FOR MIGRATING BIRDS
IN THE WINTER ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY
I'M HERE RIGHT IN THE HEART OF DUMFRIES
THAT'S ALL GOING ON ABOVE THE WATER
BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY WANT TO BREED
WHAT WE WANT TO STUDY IS HOW IT'S HAVING AN INFLUENCE ON OUR WILDLIFE RIGHT NOW SO
PLEASE SEND THEM IN TO OUR FACEBOOK SITE
SO WITH ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY
WE MISSED THE LAST ACT IN THE DRAMA
THEY ARE THERMAL CAMERAS
SO ALTHOUGH WE CAN SEE IT
WELL THEY STARTED MUCH LATER
BUT THE UPTAKE WAS SLOW
AS THEY CERTAINLY HAVE INCREASED
YOU WOULDN'T THINK THE SCALE COULD TELL YOU MUCH ABOUT A SALMON
DRIVE PAST THERE NEVER LOOK DOWN TO SEE JUST HOW MUCH LIFE IS THERE
LATER ON IN THE SERIES WE GOING BACK TO THE WEIR IN DAYLIGHT
NOT BEING SO AGILE
AND ONLY THEN DOES IT PULL AND GET THE WHOLE WORM
WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON
WE ARE BREAKING RECORDS
GIVING US SETTLED WEATHER AND THATS
AND WITH A LACK OF STORMY WEATHER
SALTN BEAUTY IT'S EVERYWHERE
WE'RE HERE THROUGHOUT REMEMBRANCE WEEK CELEBRATING COURAGE
THE GERMANS HAD KNOCKED OUT FRANCE
THIS SITE WAS AN RAF AIR BASE FROM NINETEEN EIGHTEEN UNTIL NINETEEN SIXTY ONE AND NOW
IF THEY DO IT COURAGEOUSLY
WE VALUE COURAGE SO HIGHLY BUT IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES
YOU LOSE YOUR COUNTRY
AND YOU ARE PARTICULARLY FASCINATED ABOUT THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN
WE TALK ABOUT MEN IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES FOR GOOD REASON
WOMEN TOOK TO THE COCKPITS
IT WAS A BATTLE THAT CHANGED THE COURSE OF HISTORY
AND THEN THAT WAS THE EXCITING BIT
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WHAT ARE YOU FLYING
SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOMENTS
TO GET MY PRIVATE PILOT'S LICENCE
FLYING PLANES AND THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN ESPECIALLY IS A REAL PASSION OF YOURS
HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND FOR CHURCHILL TO LAUD ALL THEIR
WE HEARD THERE ABOUT JOY FLYING SPITFIRES
PLAY UP TO THEM
LET THE LET THE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE INTERVIEW THEM
I'VE BEEN A JOURNALIST ALL MY WORKING LIFE
THAT IS JUST GOLD DUST
THAT'S THE ALSO THE RATHER EXCITING THING
THIS YEAR MARKS THE SEVENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN
IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN FORTY
WITH THE IMMINENT THREAT OF ATTACK FROM GERMANY
PRIME MINISTER WINSTON CHURCHILL WAS DETERMINED WE WOULDN'T BE DEFEATED
CHURCHILL DELIVERED A SPEECH TO GALVANISE THE NATION FOR THE BRUTAL BATTLE AHEAD
THIS WAS THEIR FINEST HOUR
BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE QUITE THE SAME PERFORMANCE AS THE SPITFIRE
AND THIS THING IS FLYING THROUGH THE NIGHT
I JUST THOUGHT THEN
IF WE HADN'T ALL PULLED TOGETHER
IF YOU THINK OF THE WHOLE SORT OF BOMBER FORCE
THEIR CHANCES OF RETURNING OFTEN
AND A BIG RANGE OF CONFLICTS AS WELL
AND THAT WAS JUST
WHAT WE HAD TO DO
BUT IT WAS DANGEROUS
I WAS IN THESE DANGEROUS PLACES BUT
BACK TO WORLD WAR TWO NOW AND
DURING THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN
DUXFORD'S OPERATIONS ROOM WOULD HAVE BEEN A HIVE OF ACTIVITY
WHO FLEW EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLANES DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR
JOY NEVER LOST HER PASSION FOR FLYING
AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO CELEBRATE THE WONDERFUL WORK SHE DID THAN BY REUNITING HER WITH ONE OF HER
BUT SHE WOULD BE DIFFERENT
AND YOU HAVE TO REVERSE THE CONTROLS BUT
HERE ARE THE THREE BELLES IN ALL THEIR FORTY S GLORY
COMING UP TOMORROW
AND FROM ALL OF US HERE AT THE IMPERIAL WAR MUSEUM
YOU MOVED AWAY FROM LUTON
I LIKE ALL THESE CLOTHES
SECURE FIRST BUY
IT'S A VERY SIMILAR FLIGHTLESS BIRD
BUT IT IS ENORMOUS
AND THESE BONES ARE REMOVED FROM THE CASERARY
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS GROUP IS
IF THEY CAME FROM A RENOWNED COLLECTION
THEN YOU COULD EXPECT TO HAVE TO PAY THE TOP END OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHERE IT COMES FROM
GOOD DECORATIVE LOT
IT A NOT TOO BAD CONDITION
THIS IS EXCITING
WHAT DID CHARLES HANSON SPEND THE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE POUNDS ON
WE'LL FIND OUT IN THE TRUENESS OF TIME
AT EIGHTY FIVE IN THE BACK SEATED ROW
AS YOU LEAD THEM THROUGH THE LUXURY BROCHURE
THEY ARE ALL UNIQUE
TAKE EVERYTHING I SAY ON BOARD AND YOUR FEARS WILL BE UNFOUNDED
AND I'M A PROFESSIONAL TO MY FINGERTIPS IN EVERYTHING I DO
AN AWARD THEY DO NOT HAND OUT LIGHTLY
AND I AM A TOUR DIRECTOR
TAKING STUDENTS ROUND EUROPE
FROM WEST LONDON
BUT IM QUITE NERVOUS NOW
THE MORE MONEY THEY EARN
AND STOP THEIR BALL ON THE EDGE
BUT THEY DO WORK VERY HARD ALSO
BUT WILL BE IN THE VATICAN
THEN THE AFTERNOON IS THE COLISEUM AND THE FORUM
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE THE QUESTIONS BUT
HE COULD WALK REALLY
IF I TAKE TWO AND DO IT ON THE FIRST THAT'S A BONUS
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL
WHERE NAVAL AVIATION HISTORY IS BROUGHT TO LIFE
THEY'RE NO SENTIMENTAL VALUE
FIRST WORLD WAR BIPLANE AND FOR MANY PEOPLE
BEFORE I RETURN TO OTON TO JOIN UP WITH OUR EXPERTS TO FIND MORE ITEMS TO PUT UNDER THE HAMMER
WE START AWAY AT FORTY TWO
RISKING THEIR LIVES DURING WORLD WAR TWO
THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF THEM
ITEMS THAT CURRENTLY AREN'T IN EXHIBITION
BECAUSE WE BROUGHT OTHER THINGS
LOTS OF MEMORIES FOR YOU
POUND THE BITS IN THE ROOM THEN
YOU ALL DONE AT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY
AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
JOIN US AGAIN NEXT TIME
LOVE IT TO BITS ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT
WE MADE THAT BIT UP
BUT AS THEY SAY
THE SHOW HERE MUST GO ON
IT'S VERY EASY TO TURN THE WHOLE BODY
WHATEVER THE JUDGES SAY
VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT ONE
TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN ILL BE JOINED BY HELEN AND A
FAMILY COMES FIRST
THAT'S WHY INTERPOWER INVOLVED IN THE POLICE OVER THERE
THE WORST IS OVER
HE'S STILL BOWLED OVER
I'M GETTING MARRIED ON FRIDAY
I'M NOT SAYING THAT I EVEN I EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WAS
THAT'S WHY I TOLD YOU
THE GROUP ARRIVED LAST MONTH
A JOBS BLOW FOR NORTHERN IRELAND
THE GOVERNMENT THINKS THEY MAY HELP TACKLE UNDER ACHIEVEMENT
THEY WANT TO BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE
WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THERE IS LESS DEVIATION IN THOSE YOUNG BIRDS IF THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ADULT BIRDS
SCOTTISH NATIONAL HERITAGE AND THE RSPB ALSO HAVE PARTS OF THAT RESERVE AND TOGETHER THEY ARE DOING A GREAT JOB
MORE HAVE ARRIVED SINCE THEN
THIS MORNING THEY COUNTED FORTY FOUR ON THE POND
ALTHOUGH THAT NUMBER COULD SWELL TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A COUPLE OF THEM NOW
THE ORANGES AND THE YELLOWS
TAKE SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF IT AND KEEP SENDING THEM IN BECAUSE WE LOVE GETTING THEM
HE IS OBVIOUSLY SAFE
SO WHAT HAPPENED AFTER SPRINGWATCH
IT WILL FREEZE OVER
THIS GRASS IS PERFECT FOR THE BARNACLE GEESE BARNACLE GEESE
SO THE NEXT FEW DAYS WELL BE UPDATING ON THIS AND BRINGING YOU THE RESULTS OF OUR PIE DIAGRAM
MOVE TO AUSTRALIA AND
IT STILL BE ME
OBVIOUSLY AT THE TIME I WASN'T MYSELF
THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT
THE WORST PART IS
IT'S AS IF EVERYONE ELSE INSTINCTIVELY KNOWS HOW TO NAVIGATE THESE SOCIAL MINEFIELDS
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BLEEP YOU
WE CAN'T SAY WHAT DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY THE INITIAL BLEED
I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAN'T CHANGE
I REALLY AM SORRY
RECOGNISED THE CATHOLIC JAMES AS THE RIGHTFUL KING OF ENGLAND
WE HAVE THE ACCOUNTS
BUILDING UP TO THE KING'S APARTMENT
HIS STATUS IS SECOND ONLY TO THAT OF THE POPE
QUEEN CLEMENTINA IS
THE FIRST LADY OF ROME
THE HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR HAD TWO
BECAUSE HE CLAIMED TO BE THE KING OF SPAIN
JAMES GAVE VOICE TO WHAT WALTON DESCRIBED AS PAROLT FORTES VERY ANGRY WORDS AGAINST HIS
WITH TWO FINE HORSES ALL GIFTS FROM THE SPANISH
NEITHER THE NOISE OF CANNON
NOR THE HISS OF BULLET COULD PRODUCE ANY SIGN OF FEAR IN HIM
DESPITE HIS YEARS
AND SO HE STARTED TO LAY OUT THE WATERWORKS
AND IT TOOK ANOTHER SIX YEARS UNTIL THE GREAT FOUNTAIN STARTED
BOS AND HOLLAND
I THINK IT WAS SAY
KEEN TO MAKE THEIR MARK
SO HE PROTECTED THEM SOMETIMES FROM THEMSELVES
AND YET AT THE END OF IT
A HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA
BOASTED ABILITY TO GET THROUGH SIX BOTTLES OF CLARET IN AN EVENING WHILE REMAINING
SECOND AND SO IT'S PARTLY ABOUT RECOVERING IN ENGLAND THAT'S BEEN LOST BUT IT'S PARTLY ALSO ABOUT
AND THAT THEY WOULD BE A STAUNCH ALLY TO THE FRENCH
TO KEEP HIS HEAD DOWN AND STAY OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE
HE WAS AN IMPERIVE MAN
SHE ANCHORED OFF THE HEBRIDEAN ISLAND OF ERISKY
HE WATCHED AS THE JACOBITE CAVALRY APPROACHED FIRST
THEN THE FOOT SOLDIERS
WHERE CHARLES RAISED HIS STANDARD
MARCHING INTO EDINBURGH
IT COULDN'T BE CLEARER HE WANTED TO TRY AGAIN
CHARLES WAS INVITED TO DINNER BY HIS BROTHER
THE FUTURE OF THE STUART DYNASTY NOW RESTED ENTIRELY ON HIM
CHARLES WAS NOW CLUTCHING AT STRAWS
THAT THEY WERE SPIED UPON
THAT THEY COULDN'T RAISE MEN
INVOLVING AS EACH UNFOLDED FRENCH
HE WAS ASKED TO LEAD THE SUPPORTING INVASION OF SCOTLAND
IT WAS ENGLAND OR NOTHING
AT THE BATTLE OF QUIBERON BAY IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY NINE
STABILITY AND
NOW PART OF THE IMPERIAL WAR MUSEUM
IT'S DEDICATED TO THE STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO'VE LIVED THROUGH CONFLICT
THROUGHOUT REMEMBRANCE WEEK
WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY BRAVERY OF PEOPLE WHO PUT THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY TO PROTECT
WE HAVE SOME STORIES OF GREAT COURAGE
FORTUNATELY FOR ME
BUT THERE WERE LULLS DURING THE BOMBING AND
AND WITH YOUNGSTERS MISSING HOME
FAMILIES WERE TORN APART
YOUNG CHILDREN WERE REMOVED FROM THEIR PARENTS TO BE PLACED FAR AWAY
WITH NEW AND UNFAMILIAR FAMILIES
WHEN THIS FOOTAGE WAS BEING TAKEN
MY MOTHER WAS COMING IN TO SEE ME EVERY DAY
THAT ISN'T RIGHT
THAT KITTY HAD BEEN FOUND A FEW YARDS AWAY FROM ME
I COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON
WHEN THE FIRST WORLD WAR BEGAN
IT WAS DURING AN AGE OF EMPIRE
THE MEN FIGHTING FOR BRITAIN CAME FROM ACROSS THE WORLD
AS MANY AS ONE IN SIX SOLDIERS FIGHTING WITH THE BRITISH ARMY WERE FROM INDIA
BECAUSE THAT WAS WHEN IT WAS
WE DON'T WANT TO GET UP
IF THEY SHOT ONE DOWN
AND VERY HANDSOME
IT WAS A VERY HAPPY STATION
WHERE I LIVE NOW IN AUSTRALIA
I GOT VERY OBSESSED BY THAT SO I MARK IN RED ALL THE WAY ALONG THE
AND SO I GAVE LITTLE PINCH AND THEN SHE SAID
AND THESE AREN'T RECONSTRUCTIONS
I WOULD'VE BEEN CALLED UP
BUT IT WAS QUITE INCREDIBLE
HE WAS SO POSITIVE
WE'D FIGHT ON THE BEACHES
AND THEY WOULD HAVE DONE
INCLUDING THESE CARAVANS
THESE THINGS ARE INCREDIBLE AND AS AN EX SOLDIER
THE THREE CARAVANS IN QUESTION WERE COLLECTED BY MONTY ALONG THE WAY
THERE WAS A SUBMARINE BASE UP AT THE TOP
ONE HUNDRED YEARS LATER
MY GRANDFATHER WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN BURIED SOMEWHERE
NOR WOULD MY FAMILY
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO
I WANT TO BECOME A CONCERT PIANIST
WHICH IS WRITTEN JUST FOR THE LEFT HAND ALONE
HE WAS SO GALLANT AND VERY
SO HE DECIDED TO USE HIS WEALTH HE'S FROM QUITE A WEALTHY FAMILY AND HE DECIDED TO COMMISSION ALL OF
BOTH YOU KNOW IN BATTLE AND ON THE HOME FRONT
I REALLY MEAN IT
TO THE EAST OF ENGLAND
SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
I GOT IT THE WRONG WAY ROUND
OR YOU COULD USE IT
HOW DO I KNOW IT WAS OFF THE COAST OF AUSTRALIA
THIS IS FIFTEEN CARAT GOLD THAT ONCE UPON A TIME WAS MINED FROM THE SOUTH
SIXTY MINUTES ARE UP
BUT IF THE TILES DON'T DO WELL
YOURE RIGHT AND I'M WRONG
YEAH MIGHT BE SAT RIGHT NOW IN HIS PAJAMAS
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
I PUT TWENTY TO THIRTY ON IT AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME
WE ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
THAT YOUVE DONE WELL THERE
YOU ARE PLUS TWENTY THREE
IT'S A PERSONAL THING
WE HAVE IT IN THE FAMILY
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM DEVON
I'M A CONTRACTS MANAGER FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BATH
I'M A CREATIVE WRITER
I LIVE IN SCOTLAND
AND POPPY IS THIRTEEN
SURROUNDED BY FINE WORKS OF ART FROM ARTISTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
WE'RE INTERESTED IN THE TASTE OF OUR EXPERTS
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT THEY'VE FOUND AT THE VALUATION
COURTESY OF JOHN AND JOSEPHINE BOWES
IT'S ALL PRINTED IN THE CATALOGUE
IF YOU'RE UNSURE
WE ARE COMING BACK HERE LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
THERE IS COMMISSION TO PAY
SOMETHING I'VE NEVER SEEN ON THE SHOW BEFORE
WHO COLLECTED TEXTILES THROUGHOUT HER LIFE
WHICH WERE BEING RIPPED OFF BECAUSE FASHIONS CHANGED
NOT ALL OF THE SEVEN
AND PIECES HAVE BEEN UNPACKED AND FURTHER RESEARCHED
HAVING SEEN SOME OF THE EXQUISITE EXAMPLES ON DISPLAY HERE
AT THE BOWES MUSEUM
WE'LL MAKE SOME HISTORY OF OUR OWN TODAY
LET'S PUT THOSE VALUATIONS TO THE TEST
GOING UNDER THE HAMMER
WE WANT TO SELL IT FOR YOU
WHEN I WAS AT PRIMARY SCHOOL
BUT ONE THING I NEVER DID WAS CRITIQUE BALLROOM AND LATIN DANCES ON SATURDAY NIGHT HE
WE ARE HERE TO GUIDE YOU OVER THE MIDWEEK HUMP AND TAKE YOU SMOOTHLY TO THE WEEKEND IN STRICTLY
STARTING WITH OUR FIRST BRILLIANT COUPLE
WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME TO CHAT TO THIS MAN
IT A BIT EASIER TO DO
A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE DID IN THE PREVIOUS TWO DANCES
WE NEED TO SEE IF YOU ARE UP TO SPEED
WE CANNOT WAIT TO SEE YOUR ARGENTINE TANGO
SO FAR WE'VE HAD EVERYONE FROM THE GB ROWING TEAM TO DANGERMOUSE AND EVEN A FIELD OF
YOUR ENTRIES ARE COMING IN THICK AND FAST SO LET'S SEE HOW YOU LOT ARE GETTING ON WITH THOSE MOVES
BUT YOU'VE ONLY GOT A COUPLE OF DAYS LEFT SO HEAD ONLINE FOR FULL DETAILS
THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE
SOMEONE SCORES A GOAL
THE SMUDGING THAT GOES FROM THE BEAK UP TO THE EYE
THEY CAN TELL EACH OTHER APART
BECAUSE THEY EACH HAVE A UNIQUE CALL THAT THEY CAN PRODUCE WHEN THEY GET LOST
SO ITS BIGGER
THEYVE GOT MORE OF THE LIGHT SENSITIVE CELLS THAT WORK IN LOW LIGHT LEVELS
SO BECAUSE WE HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE ANIMALS DOWN IN BIT
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THEM OVER THE YEARS ON SPRINGWATCH
WHICH MEANS THAT IT CAN OPEN FAR MORE WIDELY
AND MANY OF OUR GREATEST MIGRATORS WERE BORN WAY BACK IN THE HAZY LAZY DAYS OF SUMMER
WE PUT THOSE SAME FOODS OUT FOR THEM
ABOUT ARCTIC TURNS GOING FROM THE ARCTIC TO THE ANTARCTIC
NINE THOUSAND OF WHICH WERE CHAFFINCHES
BUT ALSO NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX BLACKBIRDS AND ONE HUNDRED ROBINS
LOTS OF ACTIVITY
SCANDINAVIA AND YOU CAN SOMETIMES TELL THEM APART
BUT THEY HAVEN'T YET LEARNED TO TAKE IT
WHY DIDN'T THEY COME AND TAKE THE FRUIT AND THE MEALWORMS
MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE OF OUR SMELL ON THE BAR
BUT WHEN THE RESULTS OF THE SCAT THAT WE SENT OFF TO THE UNIVERSITIES CAME BACK
COURSE HAS BEEN LYING IN A PARTICULAR SPOT
THROUGHOUT THIS REMEMBRANCE WEEK
WE ARE CELEBRATING HEROES
DURING THAT PERIOD
BEFORE WE COULD WALK
CLAIMING THOUSANDS MORE LIVES
IT IS OFTEN REGARDED AS THE FORGOTTEN WAR
WHILE THE WAR WAS BEING FOUGHT IN THE FAR EAST
THEY FACED THE DEADLIEST ODDS
IT'S A STAGGERING FIGURE
BUT MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE
THE MEN OF BOMBER COMMAND WERE REGARDED AS HEROES BUT
MANY OF THEM FELT THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO WAR WENT LARGELY UNRECOGNISED
THIS IS ONE VETERAN'S STORY
I DON'T WANT TO DIE
HALTING ONE OF THE WORST EPISODES IN BRITISH MILITARY HISTORY
THE WAR IN THE FAR EAST ENDED WHEN THE ATOMIC BOMBS WERE DROPPED ON HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI
AND A MARCH PAST AT THE CENOTAPH IN LONDON
MANY FAR EAST VETERANS ATTENDED THE EVENT AND
AS PART OF THE BBC COVERAGE
WHICH WAS NOTORIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE DEATH RAILWAY
AND FOR SOME REASON
WAS WHEN HE WAS RELEASED
AND THEY HAD A HOUSE AND A JOB
MANY ARE HERE TO SEE THE PLANES
SOME OF THE PLANES
I LOOK AFTER OVER FIFTEEN
WE NEED TO PRESERVE WHAT WE HAVE
BUT I'M HERE WITH DR MARTIN BOSWELL
THEIR INJURIES CAN BE LIFE CHANGING
AND WE WISH RICK ALL THE BEST OF LUCK WITH HIS GOAL OF WALKING TO THE CENOTAPH TO PAY HIS
WHEN THEY STARTED BUILDING THE RAILWAY
AND WHEN THE RAILWAY WAS COMPLETE
YOU WERE MOVED ON TO OTHER WORK
I WAS BEATEN IN JAPAN BECAUSE I DIDN'T SALUTE THE GUARD AND
WHICH WAS MY FAULT
YOU HAD TO LEAVE THE BARRACKS
THEY ALWAYS HAVE VERY CLEAR MEMORIES
BUT BEFORE WE GO
ROYAL GURKHA RIFLES
GO TO THE CHIPPY EIGHT AND THEN GO OVER TO THE PARK WATCH THE FIREWORKS
WHEN I WAS A KID
BUT AS YOU WELL KNOW
AND LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
I'M NOT SURPRISED
I KNOW YOU ARE THE PRODUCER HERE IN THE CIRCUS TODAY
WHAT YOU'RE LAYING ON YOUR BACK
THIS WHOLE FAMILY
HOW DID YOU COME TO HAVE THEM
WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO FIND OUT
WE HAVE A ROOM LIKE THIS AT EVERY VALUATION DAY
DESIGNATED AS A HOLDING BAY
IS ONE OF THE COUNTY'S PROUD SURVIVORS AND IT'S BEEN IN THE SAME OWNERSHIP FOR THE LAST FIVE HUNDRED YEARS
THAT IS AN IMPRESSIVE CLAIM TO FAME ONLY MADE POSSIBLE BY THE COURAGE
THE WATER SUPPLY WAS POISONOUS
THIS WHOLE PERIOD
WHICH HAS A FASCINATING COLLECTION OF ANTIQUES COMPILED OVER FOURTEEN GENERATIONS OF THE
OBVIOUSLY ENJOYED BY EVERYBODY
I SHOULD REPHRASE THAT AND SAY WHAT AN INCREDIBLE HOME
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS
BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS LOT
WE WOULD NOT HAVE A SHOW
IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU
WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU
IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE TO OUR MAGNIFICENT VENUE TODAY
AS WE HEAD OVER TO THE AUCTION ROOM FOR THE VERY LAST TIME
AND HERE IS THE PICK OF THE BUNCH OF OUR EXPERTS' LAST CHOICES
IF YOU ARE BUYING OR SELLING AT AUCTION
THERE IS COMMISSION TO PAY
STORAGE OR INSURANCE
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU
BRING THEM ALONG TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS AND HOPEFULLY
WE ARE COMING TO A TOWN VERY NEAR YOU SOON
THE TELETUBBIES DOING THE STRICTLY
WELL IMAGINE NO MORE HAVE A LOOK AT
THEY PROVED THEY WEREN'T AFRAID OF NO GHOSTS AS THEY TANGO THEIR WAY TO THE TOP
NOW THE WEIGHT IS OVER
NINE COUPLES LEFT
THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA PASO DOBLE MAY HAVE GOT MIXED REVIEWS FROM THE JUDGES BUT TO US THEY WILL
NORMALLY IT COMES AFTERWARDS
SEE IT SOMETIMES CALLED
IT HAS BEEN AWARDED SIXTY FIVE TIMES SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN NINETY FORTY THREE BY MARIA
HORSES HAVE WON IT
SOMETIMES IT'S SOMEWHERE IT'S IN A MEMORIES OF A GREAT DAY OF CHILDHOOD
I KNEW I HAD COME HOME HERE WHEN I WOKE UP THERE IN MY FIRST NIGHT THERE
AND SO I WANTED TO WRITE A BOOK OF ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING AND
CARMEL COMING OVER TONIGHT
EVEN IF YOU HAD
MY BROTHER'S ALIVE
AND NOT COME KNOCKING
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS TO ASK
I KNOW DEN COULD BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES
THAT'S HOW IT FELT FOR ME WHEN I SAW HIM
WHEN I KNEW WHO HE WAS
YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR ME AND
UNSAFE AND UNSTABLE THE VERDICT OF INSPECTORS ON NORTHERN IRELAND'S HIGH SECURITY JAIL
DOCTORS SAY THE EXPERIMENTAL GENE EDITING TECHNIQUE HAS KEPT HER ALIVE
CRISTIANO RONALDO THINKS HE IS
HE TOLD US HE'S A LEGEND
IT'S BEEN CONFIRMED TONIGHT FLIGHTS TO BRING STRANDED BRITISH TOURISTS HOME FROM EGYPT WILL
DON'T EXPECT INTEREST RATES TO RISE ANY TIME SOON
AND WE PUT SOME CAMERAS UP ON THE BRIDGE
THE BIG QUESTION IS
AND THEN WE CAN ROLL THIS OUT EVERY TIME THAT HABITAT BECOMES FRAGMENTED
AND THERE IS USUALLY AN INCREDIBLE ONE QUITE NEAR HERE AT GRETNA GREEN
FACT I WAS HOPING TO A LOW OFF WITH CHRIS TO SEE IT
TO WITNESS THE SPECTACLE
CAST YOUR MIND BACK
THROUGHOUT THE WEEK
NOW A LOT OF ANIMALS STOCK UP FOR THE WINTER
SOME WILL HIBERNATE
SOMETIMES WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE A SECOND GO AND WORK AT A PROJECT UNTIL WE GET IT RIGHT
YOU OUGHT TO BE THAT GOOD AT SOMETHING ELSE
BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T NEED TO REMOVE THE HUSK
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST OBVIOUS
BECAUSE THEY GET TRAPPED WHEN THEY OUT LOOKING FOR THE FEMALES
AND WE KNOW IT HAS A TERRIBLE REPUTATION
SOME PEOPLE STILL THINK THAT IVY STRANGLES TREES
DO LEAVE IT THERE
THAT ECOLOGICAL NICHE
AND LAST WEEKEND
THE BULK OF THOSE
A SWALLOW SUCCESSFULLY OVERWINTERED
DONT I THINK THIS IS TOO RISKY A STRATEGY BUT
BUT WE ARE SEEING CHANGES IN MIGRATION PATTERNS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE
WOULD GO DOWN THROUGH FRANCE
THEY GET TO THE TERRITORIES QUICKER
ISN'T IT AND IF YOU'VE GOT ANY UNUSUAL SIGHTINGS
THINGS ARE NOW CHANGING WELL
NORTHWESTERLY WIND
WET AND WINDY AT TIMES
DRIER SPELLS BRING AN INCREASED RISK OF FROST BUT
BUT TEMPERATURES ONLY COOLING TO WHAT'S NORMAL FOR THE TIME OF YEAR
WHATEVER THE WEATHER
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE MOUSE
BAD OR INDIFFERENT
TEA'S ON THE TABLE IN FIVE MINUTES AS AS ORDERED
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IS THERE ANY CRISPS
MY THOUGHTS ARE
YOU CAN SEE THEM DOING WELL
I'M NOT DAFT AS A BRUSH
I'LL TALK TO THE QUEEN
HE NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT WE DO
IF YOU HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE
WHEN I GET SCARED I
DIDN'T GET SCARED AT ALL TONIGHT
I WASN'T SCARED
I WORK IN FINANCE AND MY LOVE OF CHALLENGES HAS TAKEN ME TO EVERY SPACE CAMP
THE MORE MONEY THEY EARN
STOP THEIR BALL ON THE EDGE AND THEY'LL GET THOUSANDS BUT GO OVER
BEEN VERY BUSY THIS SUMMER
IF MY WIFE WOULD LET ME
IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC
I REALLY WANT THE FIVE
AS WE APPROACH REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY
WE ARE CELEBRATING THE HEROES WHO FOUGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM AND PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE MEN AND WOMEN
AND I ALWAYS SAY THAT MY DAD SPOKE THE REST OF HIS LIFE MAKING UP FOR THE FACT THAT HE YEAH HE HADN'T BEEN
AND I THINK MY FATHER BEING A VERY MACHO RO MARINE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE HAD A SON
HOPE YOU ARE WELL AND OK
THERE'S NO WAY IT COULD BE MY SOUL
IN THAT MY DAD TALKED ABOUT THE FUN TIMES
AND I THINK THAT'S THE PERHAPS THE LASTING IMPRESSION THAT AN AWFUL LOT OF SERVICEMEN HAVE THAT THEY
PROBABLY THE FIRST WORLD WAR TOO
BECAUSE YOU WERE LOSING SO MANY FRIENDS
YEAH WHEREVER YOU GO
WHATEVER AIR SHOW YOU GO TO
EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE A SPITFIRE
MANY YEARS WORKING HERE
MORE THAN ONE MILLION MEN WERE WOUNDED OR KILLED IN THE BATTLE AND IT ALSO LEFT ITS MARK ON THE
AND IT WAS TERRIFIC BECAUSE ALL THE YOUNG MEN THAT WERE NOW SERVING IN THE ROYAL MARINES WOULD BE
AND IT'S SHARING THOSE STORIES
AND I THINK THAT'S WHEN PERHAPS OLD SOLDIERS
YOU FIND IT'S EASIER BECAUSE YOU'RE WITH PEOPLE OF A LIKE MIND
EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME WE HEARD ABOUT LANCE CORPORAL JAMIE WEBB WHO WAS KILLED BY TALIBAN
THE ENEMY WERE MAYBE TWENTY
I THOUGHT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STORY TO TELL
IF IF YOU GO EVEN FROM THE YOUNGEST MEMBER OF THAT PATROL
A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER
ADRENALINE KICKS IN AND YOU GO
FROM ALL OF US HERE AT THE IMPERIAL WAR MUSEUM
WE'VE COME TO THE END OF OUR WEEK OF THE PEOPLE REMEMBER IN DUXFORD
THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME
I HAVE TO SAY IT WAS PARTICULARLY MOVING SITTING NEXT TO GARY
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TO HAVE THAT MEMORY OF WHAT IT WAS REALLY LIKE FOR THE MEN AND THE WOMEN
MY MOTHER GAVE ME SOME VERY GOOD ADVICE ONCE
GRAHAM'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY
I'M FROM EDINBURGH
I'M A COMPANY ADMINISTRATOR AND I USED TO BE A JUNIOR GO KART CHAMPION
I'M WARREN FROM NORTHERN IRELAND
I'M A ROYAL NAVY HELICOPTER PILOT
THE MORE MONEY THEY EARN
AND STOP THEIR BALL ON THE EDGE AND THEY'LL GET THOUSANDS
BEHIND THE COUNTER
IT'S GOT A BOBBLE ON IT
WE ACTUALLY MET WHEN I WAS AWAY
SHE WAS BACK HOME ON A DATING WEBSITE
THEN WE CAME BACK
BECAUSE NORMALLY I'M AH I'M PRETTY BAD
I'VE GOT REALLY ADDICTED TO IT
I'VE HAD IT STILL
STILL GOING TODAY
WE'RE STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO IT
I WOULD LOVE THAT
THERE WAS AN ARTIST THAT I VERY MUCH ADMIRED
IT'S CONSTANTLY BATHED IN SUNSHINE
A MAN WHOSE LEGACY LIES WITH HIS USE OF LIGHT
COLOUR AND HUMAN FORM
IN HIS HOME TOWN OF FALMOUTH
WHERE HE USED LOCAL PEOPLE AS MODELS
IT WAS HARD TO GET FEMALE MODELS
THEY GLADLY GAVE IT AND THESE GUYS WERE PAID QUITE WELL
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT
AND THEY ARE SO FRAGILE
IF SOMEONE WAS TO BID THIRTY FIVE
THAT WOULD BE TRAVELLING IN STYLE
I KNOW THE AUCTIONEER THINKS THAT
SEE YOU SOON FOR MANY MORE SURPRISES
GOES ALONG WITH ALL MY CRAZY IDEAS
I FELT DISAPPOINTED
MAKING SMALL IMPROVEMENTS AND I'M LOVING IT SO MUCH
I GUARANTEE YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE
WHERE A COWBOY HAT ON TV AND I' KNOW I'M AFRAID I HAVE
MAKE SOMETHING MAGICAL OUT OF THE TANGO
AND WITH SOME CLASSIC ROUTINES ALREADY IN THE STRICTLY HISTORY BOOK
IT'S TIME TO PREVIEW WHAT IS COMING YOUR WICKED WAY THIS WEEKEND WITH OUR FRIDAY PANEL
THERE'S DEFINITELY A PARTY ATMOSPHERE HERE TONIGHT
AND HEAD TO OUR WEBSITE FOR THE FULL STRICTLY PLAYLIST
TANS WITH DIFFERENT NAMES INCLUDING HAWAII
BRUNO SAID MY NEXT GUEST MALECENT THEMED WALTZ WAS MAGNIFICENT
CRAIG SAID HE LIKED THE STORY TELLING
DARCY THOUGHT IT WAS INCREDIBLY ENJOYABLE
THERE'S ALWAYS ONE
HALLOWEEN IS A REAL MOMENT
TO PLAY US OUT WITH THE WARTIME FAVOURITE
A NIGHTINGALE SANG IN BERKELEY SQUARE IS ALEXANDER ARMSTRONG
OUR VERY OWN NATALIE LOWE TOOK A SPECIAL TRIP TO MEET A COUPLE WHO HAVE KEPT DANCING THROUGH THE
TONIGHT'S CONTENDERS ARE ABOUT TO TAKE THAT SHORT BUT DAUNTING WALK TO THE INFAMOUS BLACK CHAIR
SOME HIGH SCHOOLS THERE
SO LOTS TO PLAY FOR
NO DOUBT ABOUT THE WINNER
CONGRATULATIONS TO HIM
THANKS FOR WATCHING
BUT THEN IT CHANGED
THIS IS OUR CHANCE
NO I SHOULDN'T GET MY HOPES UP
SHE'S GOT SOME KIND OF GASTRIC FLU THING
WELCOME TO MY VLOG ALIA NEED TO KNOW
I DON'T WANT YOU GETTING INVOLVED
WE MARRIED MEN HAVE TO SUPPORT OUR WIVES IN ALL THEIR HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS
SHAZIA'S GOING TO BE SO HAPPY
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO GET INVOLVED
I GOT TWO HUNDRED VIEWS ONE MAKE UP TIPS
JUST ONE NEAR MISS
I NEED TO SHOW THAT I'M STILL IN CHARGE
I ONCE KNEW A WOMAN WAS SWO BLIND THAT EVERY TIME SHE SAW A DEAD SHEEP
BUT IT WILL BE FUN
SHOVED HIM OUT OF THE WAY
YOU KNOW WHAT
I FINALLY WOKE UP
SHE'S DANCING TO A SONG CALLED TROUBLE
WILL THEIR HARD WORK PAY OFF
IT'S HALFWAY THROUGH THE COMPETITION NOW
YOU GOT TO PUT THEM IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND
THE JUDGES SCORES ARE ONLY HALF THE STORY AND YOUR VOTES COULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
JAY GETS STUCK INTO AN ARGENTINE MANGO
FULL OF ROMANCE AND PASSION WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY HELEN'S GIRLFRIENDS CHOSE THIS WEEK TO COME ALONG AND
I JUST HOPE THAT THE PUBLIC WILL SEE THAT I'M WORKING AND I'M TRYING
KELLY AND KEVIN DO A WALTZ WHILE PACKING UP THEIR BELONGINGS
THIS WEEK THEY'RE DOING A JIVE DRESSED AS A PAIR OF CLEANERS
YOU ARE ONE FIT LADY
AH YOU BREAK YOU BROKE THROUGH THE MOOLD
JEREMY TANGO WITH A HORSE
OTHER THAN THAT AND
WILL BE A SAMBA FIT FOR ROYALTY
THAT'S WHAT IT IS
HE'S DRESSED UP AS A COWBOY ANDLL BE RIDING A BIG PLASTIC
AH YOU HANDLED THE SPEED OF THAT DANCE VERY VERY WELL
DID YOU SEE THE CHROME PLATED BAGATTI
WHICH IS FASTEST
FIND OURSELVES A FIRST CLASS SET OF WHEELS
THIS ONE HAS EVERYTHING
WHAT DO YOU WANT
PROBABLY IN HIS PRISON CELL
BECAUSE IT WAS THE BLOKE WHO DEALT DRUGS IT WASN'T HIS CAR
IT'S BEEN A FAMILY TRADITION
MY FATHER BEFORE ME
AND AS THOSE GLOBAL CONFLICTS BECOME EVER MORE DISTANT
IT IS ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT FOR US TO PAUSE AND TO REFLECT ON THE IMMENSE PRICE THAT WAS PAID FOR THE
AND THEY SUSTAIN THAT TRADITION WITH GREAT PRIDE
YOU GET THAT STATUS
WHO ENJOYS EXCEPTIONAL POPULARITY WORLDWIDE
I DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THE HORRORS OF WAR
FOR PRISONERS OF WAR
SOME OF THE FAMILIES AFFECTED FOUND STRENGTH BY FORMING A CLOSE BOND TALKING AND LISTENING AND
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
AND VICTORY WAS IN THE AIR
THERE WERE TEN PEOPLE ON BOARD
BUT NONE SURVIVED
IT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE
AS I HAVE LOVED YOU
TO THE DEPARTED REST
I SPENT TIME AT A CARE HOME
LIVED ON A COUNCIL ESTATE
MOST OF THE TIME
AND THAT'S WHY I FOUNDED THE DAME KELLY HOLMES TRUST
I WAS TAKEN TO COURT PROSECUTED
THE JOURNEY TO THE TOP WAS SO HARD
EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING
IT MAY BE THE LAST
WILL NOT LET US GO OUT QUIETLY
HOLD ON TO YOUR SEATS FOR THE NEXT FIFTEEN MINUTES
MAKING HER MUCH HERALDED RETURN TO THE BBC
NIGELLA LAWSON WAS KEEPING IT SIMPLE IN THE KITCHEN
BUT FOR SOME IT WAS JUST A BIT TOO SIMPLE
AND I CAN TELL YOU
YOU COULD BE STARTING SOMETHING THERE
AND ITS POTTERY
WE KNOW HOW THIS ENDS
BUT I STILL THINK SHE WAS FUNNY AND
I FELT LIKE THAT WAS HER ONLY JOKE
OR DID YOU GLAZE OVER
WHO BETTER PLACE TO JUDGE THIS ONE THAN A GROUP OF POTTERS
THE FACT THAT ONLY MEN WERE TARGETED MEANT THE PROGRAMME MAKERS HAD DECIDED ALREADY THAT
MISINFORMING AND RATHER DENIGRATING
THE SUPERB PRODUCTION WAS SECOND TO NONE
FOR BRITAIN'S BIGGEST SEXIST TV PROGRAMME
THERE'S BEEN QUITE A BIT OF DEBATE OVER WHETHER THERE ARE CURRENTLY JUST TOO MANY COP SHOWS ON THE
IT IS OF COURSE MORE PREVALENT
AND FEW OF THEM DISTINCTIVE
I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE COMEDY
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ONLINE
SO DO KEEP TALKING THERE
AND THEN THAT WAS THE EXCITING BIT
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WHAT ARE YOU FLYING
BECAUSE I WAS QUITE
I WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THREE
DURING THE RUSSIAN CONVOYS
BUT THE SEAMEN INVOLVED HAD TO CONTEND WITH WEATHER CONDITIONS BEYOND OUR IMAGINATION
AND THE EVER PRESENT RISK OF ATTACK
WE'VE SHARED MEMORIES WITH SOME FAMILIAR FACES
AND HE'D BRING THEM HOME TO MAM AND BEAR IN MIND
MAM WAS A FANTASTIC COOK
GO TO YOUR LIFEBOAT STATION NOW
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY MOMENTS DURING THE WEEK WHICH REMIND US ALL OF THE COURAGE AND BRAVERY OF
AND ON THE HOME FRONT
THEIR INJURIES CAN BE LIFE CHANGING
BECAUSE YOU WERE LOSING SO MANY FRIENDS
IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN FORTY
WITH THE IMMINENT THREAT OF ATTACK FROM GERMANY
PRIME MINISTER WINSTON CHURCHILL WAS DETERMINED WE WOULDN'T BE DEFEATED
CHURCHILL DELIVERED A SPEECH TO GALVANISE THE NATION FOR THE BRUTAL BATTLE AHEAD
THIS WAS THEIR FINEST HOUR
LIKE MANY OTHERS
WHEN I GOT TO KNOW HIM BETTER
AND I ALWAYS SAY THAT MY DAD SPOKE THE REST OF HIS LIFE MAKING UP FOR THE FACT THAT HE YEAH HE HADN'T BEEN
AND I THINK MY FATHER
AND THIS THING IS FLYING THROUGH THE NIGHT
WOULD BE KILLED
I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT FIFTEEN
HALFWAY DOWN THE HILL THAT I LIVED IN
AND I LOOKED UP TO SEE IF IT WAS COMING ROUND THE CORNER AND I SAW A GERMAN FIGHTER
FORTUNATELY FOR ME
AND TAKE TO JAPAN
WHICH WAS NOTORIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE DEATH RAILWAY
HOPE YOU ARE WELL AND OK
AH BECAUSE I JUST SPOKE TO HIM THIS MORNING
WHO FLEW EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLANES DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR
JOY NEVER LOST HER PASSION FOR FLYING
AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO CELEBRATE THE WONDERFUL WORK SHE DID THAN BY REUNITING HER WITH ONE OF HER
THAT'S ABOUT IT FROM THIS SPECIAL PROGRAMME FOR REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY
COMES TO HAND NICELY
RESTING AND DAYDREAMING BY THE FIRE
ALTHOUGH HE LIVED ALONE
YOU THINK THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT
I'M FROM SOUTH WALES
HE'S STILL GOT HIS SIGHTS SET ON THAT ELUSIVE CHRISTMAS NUMBER ONE
IT'S AN ORIGINAL WATERCOLOUR PAINTED BY JOHN STEVENS HENSLOW
MAKING MORE PEOPLE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES
WHY NOT JUST GO FOR FULL ACCESS
AND AND WE'LL HAVE THE APPROPRIATENESS HERE FOR WALES
THINK AND WE CAN CONTROL A LOT OF THAT WITH WITH BYLAWS OR OTHER ACTIONS IF WE NEED TO
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WORK THROUGH THAT PROCESS
THAT'S WHY MANY GROUPS ARE IN FAVOUR OF CHANGE AND SOME SEE THE GREEN PAPER AS A CHANCE FOR A
SO THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR FOR EVERYBODY
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE MAINTAIN OUR RIGHTS OF WAY
I DON'T DON'T THINK THAT IS THE CASE SO
AND ASKING IF THERE IS ANOTHER WAY
THAT'S WHAT WE STARTED WITH
PLAY LIKE A GIANT TENNINET
SOLID ARMOUR PIERCING SHOT AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR
WE'D MOVED UP SEVERAL GRADES AND TANKS HAD GOT THICKER ARMOUR AND WHAT WE NEEDED
WHEREAS HERE IN WALES
QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE QUITE CLOSE TO THE COUNTRYSIDE
OPPONENTS SAY THERE IS A DANGER THIS COUNTRY COULD SIMPLY BE OVERWHELMED
PARTIALLY REVERSING THE OPEN ACCESS LEGISLATION
NEGOTIATE WITH INDIVIDUAL LANDOWNERS
I'M JOINING THE TRI E VETS WITH ONE OF THEIR ANIMAL HANDLING SESSIONS
THEN WE CAN USE THEM FOR DIFFERENT TEACHING TASKS
DIFFERENT TRAINING TASKS
THE NOMINATIONS WERE MADE
THE VOTES WERE CAST AND COUNTED
THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE REARED INDOORS
MORE AND MORE FARMERS ARE KEEPING THEM OUTDOORS AND THEY HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM THE STANDARD WHITE
I NEVER STOP THINKING ABOUT CHRISTMAS
AND WHEN WE WERE BACK ON MY PLACE
IT WAS FREEZING
JUST OVER A YEAR AGO
SO WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE PLANE HAS PLOUGHED STRAIGHT THROUGH THE SOIL
THROUGH THE PEAT AND
AND THERE'S THAT CONNECTION
SO HIS MOTHER AND FATHER
THEY THINK THEY'VE FOUND SOME HUMAN REMAINS
I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU THAT THERE IS STILL TIME TO GET YOUR HANDS ON THE COUNTRYFILE CALENDAR
SO IN THE EARLY DAYS
UM BEFORE THE VARSITY MATCH AS WELL
ALMOST EVERY SPORT
PEOPLE QUITE OFTEN SAY TO ME
HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO FIT THE RUNNING IN WITH THE WORK
SOMETHING BIZARRE COMES UPON YOU AND THERE' A MENTAL BLANK
AND UM AND THAT CAN GO THROUGH THE LADY'S LEGS
AND IT CAN HAPPEN IN A SERIES
ESPECIALLY IN THE BBC BAR
INFECTIOUS SMILE OF YOURS GOING
KIND OF WEIRD TO BE BACK
SOMEONE HAS TO BE HERE
IT'S BEEN TOUGH
AND INSIDE THE BACK
BEHIND THE PLATE
IN THIS SPARE TIME
AND SO IT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY
RIGHT UP UNTIL NOW
HAVE YOU HAD ANY IDEAS
BUT I THINK IT'S NINETEENTH CENTURY AND PERFECTLY RIGHT
WHEN HE WAS MAKING HARPS
AND THEY SUPPLIED THIS BIT OF PAPERWORK
WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL TO ME
VERY VISUAL ONE
AND DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING
THERE ISN'T ONE
I KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE A VENTRILOQUIST
AS WE'LL SEE LATER
I THOUGHT IT WAS A BUG INTO THE INSTRUMENT
SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE INSTRUMENT
THERE WAS ALREADY A TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT AT THAT TIME
WE CAN DO EARTH RIGHT NOW
WE CAN ALSO COMBINE THE TWO
NOW THERE MUST BE FIVE
I WENT TO SEE STAR WARS WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT
AT THE ABC CINEMA HAYMARKET
WHICH MAKES SENSE
GIVEN THAT IT WAS FILMED IN TUNISIA
BUT WHAT ABOUT REAL LIFE
ARE THEY CREATIVE ENOUGH
WHICH HAS THIRTY PERCENT MORE GRAVITY THAN EARTH
ARE THEY ROCKY OR ARE THEY ICY
PEOPLE ARE TAKING THE IDEA SO SERIOUSLY
THE ASTRONOMERS HAVE ALREADY POINTED RADIO TELESCOPES AT THIS STAR JUST TO LISTEN OUT
BUT IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS WE'VE ANNOUNCED A REMARKABLE
PROBABLY THE STRANGEST THING WE'VE SEEN IN THE UNIVERSE IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS
THE PLANET IS THERE
WE KNOW IT'S THERE
BECAUSE THEY TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
TO REAL PLACES WITH ATMOSPHERES
IS IF WE DID FIND AN EARTHLIKE PLANET
EVEN SIGNS OF LIFE
WHAT WOULD WE DO THEN
THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE
THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION WE NEED BEFORE WE CAN CONFIRM WE'VE FOUND ANOTHER EARTH
WE KNOW THEY'RE LARGE
THAT MEANS THEY MUST BE MADE OF GAS
PARDON THE PHRASE
MONOPOLY WAS BANNED IN OUR HOUSE
I'M A PERFORMANCE ANALYST
THE MORE MONEY THEY EARN
AND STOP THEIR BALL ON THE EDGE AND THEY'LL GET THOUSANDS
BUT GO OVER AND THEY GET NOTHING
IF I KNOW THAT I CAN ACHIEVE SOMETHING AND I DON'T ACHIEVE IT
SO I'M QUITE HAPPY WITH THAT
EVER SINCE SORT OF I READ THE FIRST BOOKS
AND I WAS ABSOLUTELY HOOKED
I DID QUITE WELL ON THIS ONE IN PRACTICE
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL
ONLY A HANDFUL SURVIVE
THOSE HIGH STREETS HAVEN'T ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED IN HAMPSHIRE BECAUSE
AND JUDGING BY THE SIZE OF THIS
THIS VICTORIAN STREET IS LAID WITH COBBLES
I DO HOPE OUR EXPERTS STAY SOBER TODAY
HE WAS THE FATHER OF LUTENS
IF WE'VE GOT A PICTURE OF A PERSON
ALL OVER THE FAR EAST
IN THE UK AND IN EUROPE
BACK IN NINETEENTH CENTURY BASINGSTOKE
RATHER THAN JUST MEMORIES
ESPECIALLY TO THE MAN WHO OWNED THIS
THE LOCAL VICAR
NOT ONLY THE FIRST WORLD WAR BUT ALSO THE INTERVENING ONE HUNDRED YEARS
WHO HAVE REBUILT THIS ENGINE AND OTHER PARTS OF THIS WONDERFUL LORRY
BECAUSE IF YOU ASKED
AND SOMEWHERE AROUND THAT ERA
AS WE HEAD OVER TO THE SALEROOM FOR THE LAST TIME
HERE'S A QUICK RECAP OF ALL THE ITEMS GOING UNDER THE HAMMER
THIS WAS DESIGNED BY DAVID VESEY
THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE THERE
I TELL YOU WHAT
IF YOU SELL THIS AND YOU GET THE RIGHT MONEY FOR IT
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THE SHOW
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
THAT WAS ONE RESULT NONE OF US FORECAST
SADLY FOR CAROL AND PASHA
OUR COUPLES THEY ARE ALL AT IT TOO
IT WAS A WEEKEND OF FIRST FOR OUR BELOVED LEN
FANS OF DAME HARDY
BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF BECAUSE THE ALMIGHTY HAS RETURNED
FOUR POINTS ON A PICTURE FRAME
A FEW WEEKS AGO
HE WAS SHOWERING IN FRONT OF THE NATION
YES HE IS IMPROVING
LIGHTNING DOESN'T STRIKE TWICE
HE'S A LOVELY BLOKE
AS LONG AS YOU'RE HAPPY
BEHIND THESE GREAT DOORS
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
BE REALLY BRAVE
THAT'S THE WAY TO MAKE CASH
ON THE OTHER HAND
YOU COULD GO WITH IT
DEPEND BUT IT STILL MEANS YOU'RE PLUS FOURTEEN
SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT THE DAMAGE
LEATHERBRIDGE HELD OUT LONGER THAN MOST
HIS RESEARCH TEAM
JUST PACKED WITH WONDERFUL
ON BEHALF OF HUMANITY
I'M BRUCE FROM BISHOP STAFORD
THE MORE MONEY THEY EARN
STOP THEIR BALL ON THE EDGE AND THEY WILL GET THOUSANDS
SHE LOVES EVERYONE EQUALLY
YOU EARNED THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THAT ROUND
MY MOTHER WAS WELSH
I'M HAPPY WITH THAT
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL
FOR THIS IMPOSING BUILDING
I CAN GUARANTEE ONE OR TWO BIG SURPRISES AND ALSO A ROLLERCOASTER RIDE AT AUCTION
HERE WE ARE IN THE GREAT HALL
AND LOVE TO GO UP THERE AND HAVE A ROOT AROUND MYSELF
ONCE THE LEATHER HAS DRIED OUT
LET'S GO BACK FOR ANOTHER VALUATION
I'VE GOT MY FAVOURITES
YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT YOURS
IF YOU'RE BUYING SOMETHING
JUST OUTSIDE OF STRATFORD UPON AVON
YOU HAVE TO PAY COMMISSION
WHETHER YOU'RE BUYING OR SELLING
I'M HEADING BACK TO OUR VALUATION DAY VENUE
THAT'S OUR FIRST THREE LOTS DONE AND DUSTED UNDER THE HAMMER
WE ARE COMING BACK HERE LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
THERE WAS PLENTY OF WORK AROUND
TWO THAT WAS BEFORE I WAS BORN BUT
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A ROBE THAT A BARON WOULD WEAR
THAT WOULD BELONG TO A BARON
FUN GAME TO PLAY
AND TALKING ABOUT TRADITIONAL SKILLS AND CRAFTSMANSHIP
THESE GOWNS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE SAME COMPANY
IT HAS DONE US PROUD AND WE HAVE FOUND TREASURES WORTHY OF OUR SURROUNDINGS AND NOW WE HAVE TO PUT
WE'VE SEEN THESE THINGS FLY
YOU FEEL NO PAIN
DOESN'T TIME FLY
TONIGHT WE ARE BRINGING YOU CONTENDERS AND SURVIVORS
WE HAVE SOME MUSIC EXCLUSIVES ON THIS WEEKEND'S DANCES AND WE TAKE A PEEK AT OUR PROFESSIONALS IN
ALL THE LAYERING THATS GOING ON
THE MISTRESS OF THE BALLROOM
WE JUST WANT TO SEE MORE AND MORE OF THE EXECUTION NOW
WE COMMENCE OUR WORLDWIDE TOUR OF THE VARIOUS STRICTLY SHOWS ACROSS THE GLOBE
TWO WEEKS AGO THEY WERE JOINT FIRST
DARE WE SAY THE WORD ROLLER COASTER
NO ONE WAS HURT
GIVE ME THE KEYS TO MY SHOP BACK
WHEN SHE GETS BACK
A FORMER SOLDIER'S BEEN ARRESTED
REMEMBER SCENES LIKE THIS ON SO CALLED BLACK FRIDAY LAST YEAR
WHO HELPED BRING THE DISCOUNT DAY TO THE UK
SAYS IT WON'T BE TAKING PART
THE REASON SHOPPER FATIGUE
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH GOT HIS CBE FROM THE QUEEN TODAY
CRITICS SAY HE'S NOT BEEN TOUGH ENOUGH
YOU CAN READ HIS FULL LETTER ONLINE
THE KREMLIN CALLED DRUG DOPING ALLEGATIONS GROUNDLESS
SAYING THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE FOR THE CLAIMS
WHAT WITH THEIR PRESIDENT
AND I ENJOY IT IMMENSELY
WHO KNOWS WHERE TO START
WHO KNOWS WHERE TO START
I CAME HERE TO STUDY TOWARDS A DEGREE IN BIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL AND
I WANTED TO IMPROVE MY ENGLISH
AND CLEAN THE SILVER THERE
WHICH SPARKED MY INTEREST IN ANTIQUES
BREAK THE DUCK AND ALL THAT
BUT I CAN DO IT FOR NINETY FIVE
TITUS SALT JUNIOR SPENT SOME FOUR
WILL OUR TEAMS TODAY MANAGE TO RECOUP THEIRS
IF YOU'RE WRONG
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
THEM BEING THE REDS
FIRST LOT COMING UP
IT'S A POSSIBILITY
I DIDN MANAGE TO FILM IT
BUT IF I GAVE TO EVERY FUNDRAISING STUDENT WHO CAME IN HERE
AND CANNOT REMEMBER HOW SHE HURT HERSELF
I KNOW WE DIDN'T GET OFF TO THE BEST START
I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE WORRIES SO MUCH ABOUT STRESS
THAT IS A REAL THING
I'M NOT GOING TO POINT THE FINGER
YOU'RE SO LUCKY SHE'S CLOSE
I'M A SCIENTIST FROM NORTH YORKSHIRE AND I RECENTLY WON A BOWLING TOURNAMENT WITH MY MUM
THE MORE MONEY THEY EARN
STOP THEIR BALL ON THE EDGE AND THEY'LL GET THOUSANDS
SO LET'S HOPE FOR THE AVERAGE
THE USUAL ONE IS
SO I'M WORKING IN RISK CONSULTING AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
THAT'S ALL I CAN GO FOR
SO I THINK THAT TOOK A LOT OF PRESSURE OFF
IT SHOULD HAVE MADE IT EASIER
DON'T DON'T BOTTLE THINGS UNDER PRESSURE
IF I HAD JUST ONE BALL AND I DIDN'T MAKE IT
I'D REGRET NOT HAVING ANOTHER GO
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL
LET'S FIND OUT WHO THE LUCKY OWNER IS WITH OUR FIRST VALUATION
I'VE BEEN TWICE
IT'S A REAL NICHE MARKET BUT
DO AS THE ROMANS DO
AND WE MAY NOT SEE ANY RARE SPECIES
I'M OFF TO FIND OUT HOW THIS BOGGY SUBSTANCE HAS NOT ONLY CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE
IF THAT CLAY IS QUITE SOLID
ON OCCASION STRETCHING FOR MILES
BY THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY
THE LANDSCAPE WAS TRANSFORMED AGAIN
WATER LEVELS ROSE
THIS TIME POURING IN
FLOODING INTO THE QUARRIES
THE ANSWER WAS TO HIRE DUTCH ENGINEERS WITH SKILLS IN BUILDING DYKES
THEY CREATED A NETWORK OF CHANNELS LINKING THE RIVERS TO THE BROADS
WITH ACCESS TO PORTS LIKE NORWICH
BUT HOW COULD THEY GET THEIR PRODUCT TO SEA
EVEN AFTER THE PUB CLOSED
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
YOU CAN SEE THE SALE IS STILL GOING ON
EVERYONE'S GONE HOME HAPPY AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING
YEAH AS I SAID ON THE SHOW
IT'S VERY COLD OUTSIDE
SMOOTHER THAN CREAMY HOT CHOCOLATE WITH EXTRA SPRINKLES
WHAT ABOUT A HOLIDAY
WE BOARD GLITTERBALL AIRLINES TO SEE HOW STRICTLY IS DONE ALL OVER THE WORLD FIRST STOP
YOUR CUMULATIVE SCORE IS AMAZING
WE ARE GOING TO
NOW AS FAST AS WE POSSIBLY CAN
BUILD A NEW RAILWAY
AND WHEN THEY BUILT THEIR NEW RAILWAY THEY SAID
WE DON'T WANT STEAM ANY MORE
BUT THEY WERE THERE WAS NO TIME TO MAINTAIN THE RAILWAYS
AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR
QUITE FRANKLY I THINK
WAS GOING TO FIND IT HARD TO CARRY ON
SO WHEN THE GOVERNMENT
AS PART OF ITS NATIONALISATION PROGRAMME
WE'VE GOT A BRIGHT FUTURE
NO DOUBT YOU KNOW CAPS WERE THROWN INTO THE AIR AND
WE'RE GOING TO MODERNISE
THEY INHERITED EVERYTHING THAT WAS WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE FORMER RAILWAY COMPANIES
THERE HAD BEEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW GREAT A FUTURE
AND EVENTUALLY CONVERT THE MAINLINE RAILWAYS TO ELECTRICITY
COMPARED WITH THE PREWAR ENGINES
WERE IMPROVEMENT IN MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT
CAPABLE OF DEVELOPING SOMETHING IN THE REGION OF TWO THOUSAND
DESIGNS HAD BEEN PRODUCED FOR STANDARD LOCOMOTIVES FOR THE WHOLE OF THE BRITISH RAILWAY SYSTEM
NOT MUCH MONEY AND LONG HOURS
YOU GET BAR OF SOAP
THEY JUST NEVER TRAVELLED ON THE TRAIN AT ALL
THEY MIGHT HAVE DONE IF THEY WERE COMMUTING TO WORK IN LONDON OR ANOTHER CITY
BUT THE THOUGHT OF GETTING ON THE TRAIN TO GO ON YOUR HOLIDAYS
IT BEGAN TO REGISTER OPERATING DEFICITS
HAVING NOT DONE SO PREVIOUSLY
AND IT WAS BEING CHALLENGED BY ROAD TRANSPORT
BOTH ON THE FREIGHT SIDE
AND AND ON THE PASSENGER SIDE
THIS IS THE ORIGIN OF WHAT WAS CALLED THE BRITISH RAIL PROBLEM
AND I THINK THIS INFORMS ATTITUDES TO MOTIVEIVE POWER
THEY WEREN'T DESPERATELY KEEN
SEVERAL THINGS WERE WORKING AGAINST IT
WHICH BY THAT POINT HAD TAKEN OVER ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR STRATEGIC PLANNING ON THE RAILWAY
HAVING BEEN COMPLETED IN NINETEEN SIXTY
FIVE YEARS' WORK
ON THAT ASSUMPTION
THAT WAS A HUGE COMMITMENT
WHAT ABOUT ALL THIS MODERNISATION
INTER CITY PASSENGER TRAINS
BUT IT WAS GOING TO BE MODERNISATION MONEY SPENT ON A MUCH SMALLER RAILWAY SYSTEM
IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THE RAILWAYS DIDN'T FALL BEHIND
AS WELL AS OF MODERNISATION
BUT THEN FROM COMPLETE REGIONS
THE WESTERN REGION
WHICH COVERED AN ENORMOUS AREA
I FELT SORRY FOR BEING
EVERYTHING WAS FALLING APART
IN THE DYING DYING DAYS OF STEAM
AND IT HAD TO DIE
BUT IT WAS JUST DISGUSTING THE WAY IT WENT OUT
AND THROUGH THE EYES OF A PAINTER
WE SUDDENLY EMBARKED ON A HEADLONG RUSH TO GET RID OF STEAM FROM NINETEEN SIXTY THREE TO
AND I THINK THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE
IT'S CRAZY TO RUN A DOUBLE SYSTEM
AND BEECHING'S GENIUS WAS HE REALISED THAT
THEY HAD A LOT OF ENGINES TO GET THROUGH
PRESERVATION SOCIETIES THAT HAD BEEN SET UP AFTER THE END OF STEAM WERE BEGINNING TO HAVE ENOUGH
AND BARRY SCRAPY YARD WAS THE LAST SCRAP YARD WHERE THEY WERE LEFT IN ANY NUMBER
DAI WAS GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM PRESERVATION SOCIETIES SAYING
CAN WE BUY THAT ENGINE BACK FROM YOU
WHEN STEAM WAS BEING RUN DOWN
NEXT TO HIS ROLLS ROYCE
THE WHOLE THING WAS SO FUNNY
AND REALLY THAT IS A TREMENDOUS STORY IN ITS OWN RIGHT
OR AT LEAST PART OF THE WIDER CIRCLE OF STEAM PRESERVATION SOCIETIES IN THIS COUNTRY
WOMEN TO USE THEIR OWN TIME
THEIR OWN MONEY
THEIR OWN ENERGY TO DO PRECISELY THAT
I JUST FIND IT UNBELIEVABLE
IT'S REALLY A GREAT PRIVILEGE AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO HAVE HAD THIS CHANCE
WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL AND BORED
AND THE CHANCE TO ACTUALLY BUILD A FULL SIZE ONE
ME AT THE AGE OF FIFTY SEVEN
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THEY'RE RIGHT
NOT READY FOR A RELATIONSHIP
THEY GO FOR INFLATABLE CROCODILES AND SPLASHING
TONGUE EXPLORING EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY
THE CLACTON SARDINES HAD CLAIMED SECOND PLACE IN THE ESSEX INTERMEDIATE SWIMATHON
I KNOW WHERE MY MONEY WOULD BE
I'LL START WITH BUTTERFLY
SO IF YOU SEE ME DOING ANYTHING ELSE
FEEL FREE TO YELL
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTERFLY
BRINGING BACK ALL THE OLD TEACHER BANTER
BUTTERFLY IS ACTUALLY THE HARDEST STROKE
GOD BLESS THE TERRITORIAL ARMY
SINCE WE'RE ON DRY LAND
SO IF YOU'RE FEELING A BIT RUN OFF YOUR FEET AND HAVE AN UPSET STOMACH
BIG MONEY WHICH EVERY TIME
I'VE SEEN SOMETHING IN THE CORNER
I SPOTTED THAT EARLIER
HAVE A NICE CUP OF TEA
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
IT WAS BUILT TO IMPRESS YOUR VISITORS
AND WHILST IT MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY ALTERED SINCE THE TIME OF THE SIXTH
THE CURIOUS THING ABOUT BAROQUE DECORATION IS
THE ORIGINAL FLOOR
BECAUSE IN THAT DOORWAY
HE RAISED ANOTHER ARMY
FOR THE RED TEAM
WASHINGTON TO BE PRECISE
BUT THEN I'M VERY
IN CASE YOU'RE RIGHT
AND IT'S GOT A MUSICAL MOVEMENT IN THE SEAT
SHOPPING IN THE SAME PLACE FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY
WHICH I THINK MIGHT'VE DONE A LOT BETTER
I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU
I'VE BEEN MISLED BY ALL OF THE DOCTORS HERE
I HAVE TO DROP IT OFF WITHIN THE HOUR
PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT
I'LL FIND SOMEWHERE MORE RECEPTIVE TO MY MESSAGE
THE PAIN I HAVE SUFFERED
BECAUSE NO DOCTOR WILL RISK GETTING STRUCK OFF FOR THE LIKES OF YOU
WE SAW IT EVERY DAY
TRY MAKE HER UNDERSTAND
THE MORE MONEY THEY EARN
STOP THEIR BALL ON THE EDGE AND THEY'LL GET THOUSANDS
BUT GOT SOME MONEY
I'VE PLAYED MIXED OPENS
YOU EACH ROLL ONCE MORE
AND ALSO I'D LIKE TO TAKE MY MUM AND DAD TO PARIS
SHE'S MY FIRST DAUGHTER AND SHE'S DADDY'S PRINCESS
WE ARE SO LUCKY TO BE IN THE HEART OF BRITAIN'S BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE
LET'S HOPE WE CAN ATTRACT THE VISITORS
WHICH HAS BEEN VERY POORLY STRUCK
IT'S NEARLY NINE HUNDRED YEARS OLD
THERE WAS NO CENTRAL HEATING
THERE STILL IS NO CENTRAL HEATING
TIME HAS STOOD STILL
AND THE HEART OF THE WOOD ITSELF IS IMPERVIOUS TO WOODWORM AND BEETLE
YOUVE JUST SEEN THREE WONDERFUL ITEMS
YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT YOUR OWN OPINIONS
BUT WE DO HAVE OUR EXPERT

WHILE WE ARE HERE IN THE AREA
AH FILMING IN THE PEAK DISTRICT
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID
THEY COULDN'T STOP US
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THOSE WORDS HAD BEEN USED
HISTORY WAS MADE
AND IT'S THE BEST
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN CHINA
ALL OF THIS IS ONE PIECE
OUR EXPERTS ARE WORKING FLAT OUT TO UNEARTH GEMS FROM THE PAST FIT FOR OUR HISTORIC SURROUNDINGS
YOU'VE GOT TO BE RIGHT HERE
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE VALUE
WEVE JUST HEARD SOME FABULOUS ONES
I'VE LOVED EXPLORING THE GREAT OUTDOORS AND WE'VE HAD SOME GREAT RESULTS INDOORS AS WELL AND THAT'S
UNTIL THE NEXT TIME
IT'S NEARLY THE WEEKEND

SPEAKING OF EX COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS TURNED ELECTRICIANS TURNED PROFESSIONAL DANCERS
TAKES TO AND CAST YOUR VOTE NOW

IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF OUR STRICTLY JUDGES HAS BEEN MOONLIGHTING ELSEWHERE
HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR MY FIRST COUPLE
MY O LEVEL ITALIAN LET ME DOWN
SO LET ME REDEEM MYSELF
THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T ENJOY A FEW MORE OF YOUR WORKS OF ART
REMEMBER THE COMPETITION IS NOW CLOSED
WE'LL BE REVEALING THE WINNERS OF THOSE STRICTLY BLACKPOOL TICKETS RIGHT HERE ON MONDAY
IT'S NEARLY FRIDAY WHICH MEANS TWO THINGS
TIME FOR OUR FINAL COUPLE
I TELL YOU WHAT
THAT BALLROOM HAS BEEN CALLING FOR A THOROUGH DEEP QUEEN FOR YEARS
JUST HAPPENED ON MONDAY
MUM MARRIED MY DAD AND
TONIGHT A HUGE THANK YOU TO ALL OF MY GUESTS
HE GETS TO THAT STAGE AND HIS ELBOWS ARE BEHIND HIS BACK
WHEN ALL THE TIME
IF YOU LOT CAN'T ACCEPT THAT
THIS ALL BLOWS UP AGAIN
I'M ELAINE DUNKLEY WITH YOUR NINETY SECOND UPDATE
SHE MADE THE OTHER WOMAN WEAR A BLINDFOLD WHEN THEY MET
HE'D ACCEPTED AN INVITE FROM THE OWNERS TO VISIT THE SHOP WHICH SUPPORTS THE HOMELESS
THE STAR CALLED IT PRETTY AMAZING
CANCER TREATMENT AND AMBULANCE RESPONSE TIMES
PASSPORT FREE TRAVEL WITHIN EUROPE IS AT RISK BECAUSE OF THE MIGRANT CRISIS
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS
I WOULD LOVE IT
THAT'S WHAT I SAY
WHAT YOU DID DO
THAT'S HOW HE LOOKED
SELLING FOR JUST A PENNY EACH
WITHOUT A SHADOW OF DOUBT
AND THEN AS SOON AS THEY HAD THE FIRST DRAG
AND NAZI SCIENCE DIDN'T HAVE A GREAT REPUTATION AFTER THE WAR
SO MUCH OF IT WAS FORGOTTEN ABOUT
BUT THERE WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A LINK
THE REACTION WAS
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS
WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT
EVENTUALLY THEY SORT OF MOVED IT ALL TO THE BACK OF THE PLANE
EVEN IN THE LATE SEVENTIES
AND IT WAS TWO THINGS THAT REALLY
IT WAS THE MOST SHOCKING REVELATION
THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE JUST SAT THERE NOT SAYING ANYTHING
BUT I WANT YOU TO STOP ALL THIS ACTIVISM
IT WAS THE STUFF THAT WAS HITTING HOME
HE SLAMMED SHUT HIS AND WALKED OUT
I'M FROM THE CHOP
IT'S PREDICTED THAT AS MANY AS FORTY
THAT IF YOU GO INTO A ROOM
AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S HAD A REAL IMPACT
THOUSAND SMOKERS GAVE UP THE HABIT WITHIN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS AFTER THE BAN
I LIKE WORKING WITH OTHER PEOPLE
I COULD ASK ROB
OPERA IS NOT JUST FOR THE UPPER CLASSES
UNTIL ADRIAN BECAME MY BOSS
IT WAS JUST FLIRTING
IT'S ONLY RECENTLY THAT IT'S GOT A LOT WORSE
IN HIS SPARE TIME
TAKE SOME TIME TO THINK
OF COURSE I HAD CONSIDERED CHARLES BONNET SYNDROME
I WORK FOR A LOCAL AUTHORITY
I'M VERY COMPETITIVE
I'M A CUSTOMER RELATIONS TEAM MANAGER FROM TSIDE
AND I'M CURRENTLY TRAINING FOR A TEN MILE RUN
STOP THE BALL ON THEIR EDGE AND THEY'LL GET THOUSANDS
BUT GO OVER AND THEY GET NOTHING
I'M HAPPY WITH THAT
SO I ORGANISE EVENTS ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY
I WANTED IT A BIT CLOSER
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE SHORT
WHICH IS A FIVE K TIMED RUN
SO WE JUST LIKE TO GO AND EXPERIENCE A LOT OF THE OLD MEDIEVAL HISTORY AND GO TO THE CASTLES WHEN
SO I KIND OF WANT TO GO THERE
CLIMB MOUNT FUJI
CARRYING NEARLY TWO
WHEN HE'S HAD A GOOD BIT OF A CLEAN
THEY WERE MADE FOR ENTERTAINMENT
THIS WEEK IS THE TURN OF OUR ARMS AND MILITARY EXPERT
IT'S A PICTURE OF EXTREME VALUE
WORTH MANY MILLIONS OF POUNDS
BUT I THINK BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER ON THE FRONT
IT PROVES THAT IT WAS AT A PLACE AND AT A TIME WHICH IS EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT IN THE LIFE OF
IS THE PAPER JUST A LITTLE BIT FRESH
HAS ACTUALLY DECIDED TO CREATE NOT JUST A FAKE
BUT A FAKE HISTORY
AND WHAT KIND OF VALUE THEY MIGHT HAVE
HAVE A LOOK AT OUR WEBSITE
UNTIL NEXT TIME
THAT WAS THE ONE
AND WE'RE WITH YOU FOR THE NEXT HOUR
AND OUR GREEN ROOM IS CHOCK FULL OF BEAUTIFUL FACES TONIGHT
BUT WILL THE COURSE OF STRICTLY LOVE RUN SMOOTHLY
TONIGHT IS ALSO CHILDREN IN NEED NIGHT
EARLIER TODAY I SAW JAY AND ALIONA PRA PRACTICING IN THE STUDIO
NOW CLASSIC CHILDREN IN NEED FUN AND FROLICS
ALL WILL BE REVEALED LATER ON
AND WE WERE ACTUALLY CLOSE TO THEM ON THE LEADERBOARD WHEN WE GOT TO JUDGES' SCORES
IN THE SHOW AND WE HAVE THE RAVISHING JOANNE CLIFTON UP AT ELSTREE STUDIOS
WE CAN SEE THE BAND
CHILDREN IN NEED AND STRICTLY COME DANCING HAVE WALTZED TOGETHER MANY A TIME TO CREATE SOME TRULY
YES IT WAS TERRIFYING
IT WAS VERY VERY COMPLICATED BUT
BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE COMING AND GOING
THIS YEAR THEY HAVE AN ABSOLUTE HUMDINGER IN STORE FOR YOU
IT ALMOST CAUSED A TRAFFIC JAM
IT'S KATIE AND ANTON
FOUR MORE CONTENDERS TONIGHT
EACH OF WHOM IS HERE WITH THE FIRM INTENTION OF MOVING THROUGH TO THE NEXT ROUND AND THEN TO THE
SO PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
AND YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON TWITTER AT MASTERMINDZ
EARLIER IN THE YEAR
WHEN WE DO GET THEM IN
WHICH IS ABOUT EVERY TWO TO THREE MONTHS
STRAIGHT INTO THE CHEESE FAT
THE FARMER THEN KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'VE SOLD BEFORE THE NIGHT OF THE COLLECTION
IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SLIGHTLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE BIG BOYS
BUYING FROM A SUPERMARKET
AND THEN AT THE END OF AUGUST
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED OUR CELEBRATION OF GREAT BRITISH PRODUCE AND OFFERED YOU A FEW IDEAS ABOUT
THEY BOTH BRING REALLY DIFFERENT THINGS TO THE COMPETITION AND TO OUR GROUP
I ENJOYED THE FIRST PERFORMANCE
EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOING PAST THEM
THE BAIT FISHING MAY STILL BE A LITTLE BIT OF A CHINK IN HIS ARMOUR
IF I SEE SOMEONE
IT'S LIKE HE HAS JUST
THE ORIGIN OF THE WELLINGTON BOOTS WE WEAR TODAY
BUT BUSINESS WAS BRISK
I WAS WALKING ALONG THE BEACH
SO IT DOES HAVE ITS USES
AND SO THAT CONNECTION
I ABSOLUTELY KNOW NOTHING
AMONGST OTHER THINGS BUT
PUT ON A PIECE OF FURNITURE
HE INVOLVED HIMSELF IN THINGS
THINGS LIKE AMATEUR DRAMATICS
THINK THAT ALTHOUGH HE WAS AN ORDINARY MAN
AND THEN HE WOULD DESCRIBE HIMSELF AS SUCH
AND IT WAS A SEVERE LACK OF FOOD
I LOVE I THINK THEY'RE VERY AMUSING TO LOOK AT
EACH TIME YOU LOOK AT THEM
AT THE END OF THE DAY
AND WE'VE GOT TO FACTOR THAT IN
DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT'S MADE IN AUSTRIA
AND USING NOTHING BUT MOTORING BASED ART
WE WOULD ATTEMPT TO GET THIRTY
THOUSAND VISITORS THROUGH THE DOOR UP NORTH IN A SINGLE WEEK
I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT DRAWING
ALL WE NEED NOW IS A TAME RACING DRIVER
BUT WE BOLTED IN THE MERCEDES BENZ ENGINE IN THE BACK BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT WASN'T MADE FOR THAT
HE WON THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WORLD CONSTRUCTORS' CHAMPIONSHIP FOR BRAUN
AND WHEN HE WAS PIPPED TO THE BBC'S SPORTS PERSONALITY OF THE YEAR AWARD LAST WEEKEND
IT WAS THE MIRACLE SUBSTANCE OF THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY BECAUSE IT HAD SOME VERY STRANGE PROPERTIES
IT'S A VERY UNPLEASANT MATERIAL TO BE AROUND
SO THIS IS THE PROBLEM THAT GOODYEAR WAS TRYING TO SOLVE
ON OFFER WAS A REWARD OF TEN THOUSAND
AND BAEKELAND THOUGHT HE COULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY CREATING A NEW
BUT WHAT'S MISSING
THESE OBJECTS THAT WE THAT FORM SUCH A LARGE PART OF OUR LIVES
THIS MATERIAL OF A THOUSAND USES
CERAMICS AND LEATHER
BUT WHERE THEY CAN BE USED
IT'S EVEN THE SUPERSTAR OF THE ELECTRONIC WORLD
BUT THERE'S AN INTRIGUING NEW WAY OF DESIGN MATERIALS THAT PROMISES SOMETHING DIFFERENT
SO THE END RESULT IS THAT
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MADE UP OF MANY
SO LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
BUT ONE THING IS FOR CERTAIN
THEY ARE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE A PROFIT
THE MARK AND TYPE OF MOTORCAR
AND IF YOU OWNED A PERIOD AUSTIN SEVEN SWALLOW LIKE THAT
YOU'LL PAY A LOT MORE THAN TEN POS FOR THE PHOTOGRAPH WHICH ILLUSTRATES IT FROM THE CORRECT
IT WILL MAKE PROBABLY BETWEEN FORTY AND SIXTY
UM YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT
YOU CAN PARK YOUR WINNINGS AND WALK AWAY
HE WAS HURT MUCH WORSE THAN ME
AND MAKE DIFFICULT PHONE CALLS
HAVING A GOOD OLD STRICTLY GOSSIP
I SAID NO A FEW TIMES
SAYING YOUVE GOT TO DO IT
AH JEREMY AND KAREN ARE HERE AS WE SAY SO LONG
AND TO GET THIS FAR TAKES A LOT OF HARD WORK
BUT BEHIND EVERY GREAT CELEBRITY
MY NEXT COUPLE HAD TO SETTLE FOR JOINT SECOND THIS TIME I MEAN
IT WAS LIKE THE BALLROOM SCENE FROM CINDERELLA
WE GO FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE LEADER BOARD TO THE TOP
THEY WENT UNDERGROUND FOR A SPOT OF MINING ON SATURDAY NIGHT
BUT SADLY THEY DIDN'T STRIKE GOLD AND WERE ELIMINATED FROM THE COMPETITION
THE COMPETITION IS SO FIERCE
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A RACE AND IT'S A VERY
VERY IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE IT'S TO SEE WHICH IS FASTEST
WE DROVE ACROSS SPAIN IN THREE BUDGET SUPERCARS
WHAT DO YOU COME UP WITH NEXT
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT
WE MUST NOW FIND OUT HOW FAST IT GOES AROUND OUR TRACK AND THAT
IT IS IN FACT WOLVERINE
SO THAT'S WHERE YOU FIND HIM
OR THE SAMURAI STORY AND IN HE GOES
I DID A COUPLE OF EMMATE MUSICALS AND
AND I WAS REALLY BAD
AND THEN IT GOES REALLY HIGH AND EVERY NIGHT
I'VE BEEN COMING HERE FOR MANY YEARS
LIKE WHEN I GOT THE PART OF WOLVERINE
I WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT NO MATTER WHAT IT WAS
WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE
BECAUSE EVERYWHERE HE GOES
THEIR ATTENTION TO DETAIL
FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN
AND LOOK AT YOU
YOU DO A COUPLE OF MOVIES
EVERYONE'S WALKING AROUND
THEY'RE THEIR NATURAL SPRINGS AND THEY'RE HOT
LIKE TO COOL MYSELF DOWN
ONE GUY WHO WAS SITTING IN THE TUB LIKE THIS
THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE TOWEL
THAT WE DON'T MAKE STUFF ANYMORE AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T MAKE VEHICLES
AND WE WERE WONDERING WHAT ELSE IS
USING TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOW COPIED GLOBALLY
AREN'T WE CLEVER
WE DECIDED TO FIND OUT JUST HOW MUCH
WE HATCHED AN AMBITIOUS PLAN
WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT LONDON WAS BUT
THAT'S THE ONLY THING KEEPING ME AND AMY GOING RIGHT NOW
LET'S NOT HANG ABOUT
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
IT'S NOT REAL ESTATE TODAY
AND HAVE A GOOD RUMMAGE
I'M HAPPY WITH THAT
BUT IT'S A SWEET THING
BEARING IN MIND THAT THE GEE GEES FROM THE FAIRGROUND ARE NOT GOING TO BE SO HOT
YEAH NOT QUITE ENOUGH
YOU'VE GOT A STEADY HAND WHEN IT COMES TO THESE ANTIQUES
WHEREVER YOU ARE
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO
SHE KNOWS THEY'RE NOT
I WAS JUST IT WAS A DREAM COME TRUE
IT DIDN'T MATTER TO US THAT LEN FELT LIKE THAT
THANKFULLY HE IS NOT QUITE THERE YET
UM ALTHOUGH WE ARE GOING SOON SO
TAKE THE PHONE OFF THE HOOK
GET YOUR CUPPA AND SETTLE DOWN FOR YOUR DAILY STRICTLY FIX
PERSONALITY BUT COME ON LET
THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF
THEY SUCCESSFULLY BOOM
SHAKED THEIR WAY UP THE JUDGES' LEADERBOARD ON SATURDAY
ITS TIME TO TALK TO A COUPLE WHO ARE OFFICIALLY THE UNDEFEATED CHAMPIONS OF THE DANCE OFF
I DID EXPECT IT
YOU SAW THE RIGOROUS AUDITION PROCESS SO
I BARELY SLEPT LAST NIGHT
IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME RIGHT NOW
WITH HIS NEW SCALP
SECURITY IS TIGHT FOR THE FOOTBALL FRIENDLY BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND AT WEMBLEY
IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES THE CROWD SANG THE FRENCH NATIONAL ANTHEM
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
I COLLECT EVERYTHING
AND YOU LOOK JUST LIKE THE GIRL ON IT
I'D BEEN MARRIED FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS
I LIKE YOUR STYLE
TO MAKE A PROFIT ON THAT
AND FIND ALL THE TRAPPINGS OF NOBILITY
BEHIND WHICH THERE IS A BIT OF A BACK STORY
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS OF COURSE OVER AT THE AUCTION
SA INVESTED THIRTY FIVE
BUT LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT ANYWAY
IT'S A BIT OF FUN
NOT GOOD ENOUGH
OVERALL YOU ARE MINUS SEVENTY EIGHT
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT AMELIA
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
EVERY SO OFTEN I THINK ABOUT TRYING TO TRACK HIM DOWN
WITH A POWERFUL CONSORTIUM
THEY BOUGHT IT AND THEY SAVED THIS HOUSE AND ALL OF ITS TREASURES FOR THE NATION
RIGHT UP TO EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX
WHAT IS THE PRICE OF GOLD TODAY
IN NO SMALL PART BECAUSE HE IS THE FIRST CABINET MAKER TO PUBLISH A BOOK ON HIS DESIGNS THE
AND HE MADE SURE THINGS SAT IN HARMONY AND THEY WORKED REALLY WELL TOGETHER
THIS STATELY HOME BOASTS THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF EARLY CHIPPENDALE YOU WILL FIND ANYWHERE
AND I TELL YOU WHAT
THAT'S CLOSE TO THE DOCK
MY MOTHER WASN'T KEEPING GOOD HEALTH AND SHE ALWAYS COMPLAINED
BUT IT'S SUCH A NICE EXAMPLE
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY BUT
I'VE HAD A GREAT TIME EXPLORING SOME OF THE RICHES OF DUMFRIES HOUSE
ESPECIALLY JENNY'S NECKLACE
JOIN US AGAIN SOON FOR MANY MORE
YOU HAVE TO REALLY WARM UP YEAH
HOW ABOUT A FIRST LOOK AT OUR COUPLES IN TRAINING FOR BLACKPOOL
SHUT THE FRONT DOOR
THE VOTES HAVE BEEN COUNTED AND VERIFIED
WE WE DANCED THERE ALL OUR LIVES
THINK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US HAS HAD SOME SORT OF INJURY
COME COME ENJOY THE PARTY
AS THE EMPRESS OF STRICTLY
THAT'S ALL FOR THIS EVENING MY STRICTLY FRIENDS
I LOVED THE CHOREOGRAPHY
AND BECAUSE THE CHALLENGES THEY HAD IN MIND WERE QUITE SERIOUS
TRACK DAYS THESE DAYS ARE VERY POPULAR
THE IDEA IS THAT YOU DRIVE YOUR OWN CAR TO A RACE CIRCUIT
WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANT FOR RACING
THE GERMANS WERE ALL DRUNK
RUNNING AROUND CELEBRATING THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL
IS A DOG LEG FIRST GEAR
I'VE GOT SOME OF THE LETTERS HERE
I BET IF THE STIG DROVE IT
DEAR TOP SO CALLED GEAR
WHAT PORSCHE DO IS
I WASN'T IN CHARGE
WE BEGIN WITH JEREMY
RICHARD HAMMOND DRIVES ACROSS GERMANY IN A DEATH TRAP
HE DIDN'T SEE ONE OF THOSE MINUTES YEAH
THEY PUT THAT LAP ON THE ON YOUTUBE
AND WE WERE TOLD TO DO THE SAME THING
LET'S MAKE LOVE
GREAT BRITISH BAKE OFF
HAD THREE CHILDREN
THIS IS MY MOM JUDITH
AND I ALSO CAME ROUND TO SEE IF ANYONE NEEDS A TOUR OF LONDON TOWN
SHE NEEDS MY BEDROOM SO YOU'RE GOING IN WITH OWEN AND
THIS ONE SOUNDS LIKE TROUBLE
THE MOUNTING EACH OTHER ON THE POOL TABLE
IT WAS VERY COLD
JUDGING BY THE FEW PROGRAMS CHRIS HAS MADE ME WATCH
THEY'VE YET TO FINISH THEIR SHOPPING
WHAT MIGHT YOU BE ABLE TO BUY IT FOR
THAT'S IT THEN FOR THE BLUES
YOU ARE IN PROFIT
DON'T GET ME WRONG
BUT IN THIS CASE NOT
TO ASK THAT ALL IMPORTANT QUESTION
DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
SO THAT IS ANYTHING THAT CAN BE EASILY PACKED AWAY AND MOVED AROUND
NOTHING NEW IN THIS WORLD
THAT'S WHAT THE SALORS ALL ABOUT
SIT BACK AND ENJOY THIS ROLLER COASTER RIDE AS WE PUT THEM TO THE TEST
IT WAS MADE TO BE USED
VERY EXPENSIVE STUFF
LET'S GIVE IT A BASH
THEY CANNOT BE WITH US TODAY
THAT CONCLUDES OUR FIRST VISIT TO THE AUCTION TODAY
WE ARE COMING BACK HERE LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
WE'RE IN FOR A REAL TREAT
BECAUSE THIS ATMOSPHERE IS FANTASTIC AND ON THAT STAGE
PURELY JUST BY APPEARING ON THERE
BOLD AND BOISTEROUS
SORT THING AND IN THE EARLY DAYS
MORE PEOPLE CAME IN BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT THOSE CUSTOMERS WOULD SING SOMETHING
AND SO THEY STARTED TO PAY THE AMATEUR SINGERS AND THAT WAS HOW THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF MUSIC
THEY CALLED THEM HALLS OF MUSIC
THE MOMENT YOU WALK INTO THE AUDITORIUM
AND YOU NOTICE ALL THE FIXES AND FITTINGS
THERE'S A SPECIAL EVENT THAT TAKES PLACE JUST AFTER LUNCH
THEY WERE MADE FOR THE VICTORIAN TRAVELLER
I LOVE THIS NEXT LOT BECAUSE I'M A BIT OF A SHELL COLLECTOR
HOW OLD WAS SHE
BECAUSE I'M JUST TRYING TO DATE THE SCENE HERE
COACH TO BLACKPOOL IS WAITING FOR YOU OUTSIDE
THE STRICTLY CHRISTMAS LINE UP HAS BEEN REVEALED AND WE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK BUT
SHE'S GOING TO HELP ALL OF OUR COUPLES ILLUMINATE THE STRICTLY DANCE FLOOR LIKE THE BLACKPOOL TOWER THIS WEEK
AND I DECIDED TO COME HERE
AND SHE BRINGS GIRL POWER TO THE JUDGES' PANEL AND HAS TO SIT BETWEEN CRAIG AND LEN
WE CAN ONLY APOLOGIZE
YOU WOULD NEVER IMAGINE THAT EACH SEASON COULD GET BETTER BUT
THIS WAS A FUSION OF STYLES YEAH
AND THEN TO HAVE THE SAMBA
BUT EVERYTHING WAS GOING FOR IT UNDERNEATH
THE THINGS I KNOW ABOUT THIS MAN
A WORLD WHERE A RAPIST GETS AWAY WITH IT
I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN WOLFOW RESERVOIR
THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT IS
I'M NOT HERE ON HER BEHALF
OFFICERS SEARCHING FOR KAYLEE HAYWOOD HAVE FOUND A BODY
THEY BELIEVE IT IS THE MISSING TEENAGER FROM LEICESTERSHIRE
THE SUSPECTED RINGLEADER OF THE PARIS TERROR ATTACKS IS DEAD
JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND ARE GOING ON STRIKE
THEY VOTED MASSIVELY IN FAVOUR OF ACTION IN THEIR ROW OVER A NEW CONTRACT
WHO CALLS SPARTA FOR REUL
WITH ALL OUR FACE PAINT ON
I WANT TO HELP PEOPLE
WE COULD TAKE A FUND
WE MET ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO THROUGH MUTUAL FRIENDS
YEAH WE GOT TOGETHER
I DON'T HAVE ANY WORRY
TODAY LET'S GO AND FIND OUT WHAT SORT OF A FLIGHT OUR TEAMS ARE ABOUT TO ENJOY
BUT FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE JOLLY OLD AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT JONATHAN'S BOX
FIFTH IN FROM THE RIGHT
HE WAS THE ONE WHO PICKED ME UP WHEN I FELL DOWN
I DON'T THINK SO
HE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE A SOLDIER AND TO FIGHT IN THE ARMY
BUT HE WASN'T BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE A FATHER
WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT YOU
HOW COULD IT BE
THAT WAS THE EASY BIT
WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT
KINGS AND QUEENS HAVE BEEN WINED AND DINED
DURING THE TUDOR PERIOD
FOR ONE DAY ONLY
THIS MAGNIFICENT HOUSE BECOMES OUR BACKDROP FOR OUR VALUATION DAY
SO LET'S NOW CATCH UP WITH EXPERT MICHAEL BAGGOT
I'VE ALREADY GOT MY FAVOURITE
YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT YOURS
TOUGH THING TO SELL
BUT ALL THAT WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE
I'M HERE TO SHOW OFF AND IMPRESS
DURING MEDIEVAL TIMES
AND INDEED THE TUDOR PERIOD
THE LANDED GENTRY AND NOBILITY LIVED IN CASTLES AND FORTIFIED MANOR HOUSES BUILT AROUND A COURTYARD
THAT HE BROUGHT A BUILDING STYLE
TO HIS OWN HOUSE
HAVE A GLASS OF WINE
A LITTLE LATER ON
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
WITHOUT A ROOF PLAN
AND CONSIDERING ALL
LONGLEAT HOUSE IN WILTSHIRE
BUT RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS TO DO IN THE AUCTION ROOM
BROUGHT ALONG BY NICK
WHO HAD A FEW OTHER THINGS AND SOME OTHER ITEMS AT HOME
IT'S TAKING ITS TIME
I DO BELIEVE THAT MAKES IT THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIXTH TIME I'VE SAID BLACKPOOL THIS WEEK
THE LOVELY JV
KING OF THE GREEN ROOM PARTY
IT WAS A TOUGH SELECTION PROCESS BUT IN THE END HIS EXPERIENCE A DONKEY HANDLING WAS SECOND TO NONE
EVEN PUNCH IS AT IT
OUR COUPLES HAVE BEEN KEEPING THE WORLD UP TO SPEED ON THEIR PREPARATIONS
I DO BELIEVE IT'S NOW THAT PART OF THE SHOW WHERE I WELCOME A TRIO OF HIGHLY ESTEEMED EXPERTS TO
SADLY THEY COULDN'T MAKE IT
SO INSTEAD LET'S HEAR FOR LOUIS SMITH
HOW DOES THAT FEEL
WE GOT HERE BY CAR
YOU HAVE TO ORDER
WAIT FOR THE FOOD
I'M REALLY EXCITED FOR THESE GUYS
NOW WE ALL KNOW THAT BLACK PO IS THE SPIRITUAL HOME OF BALLUM WHY IS IT SO SPECIAL
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN THERE FOR
SO MANY QUESTIONS
IT JUST BECAME THE HUB OF BALLROOM DANCING
ON MONDAY'S SHOW
YOU CAN SEND IN A VIDEO QUESTION
DETAILS ARE ON SCREEN RIGHT NOW
WHEN THIS PLACE IS FULL TOMORROW NIGHT
AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING AROUND THE UK
CLAE I'LL BE BACK ON MONDAY WITH THE UNLUCKY COUPLE TO LEAVE THE COMPETITION
FROM HIS NEW ALBUM
BUT SHANE FILAN AND NADINE COYLE WITH I COULD BE
SHE ALWAYS KIND OF GOT THIS LOVELY BIG SMILE AND SHE ALWAYS MAKES ME SMILE WHEN I WATCH
THAT IS WHEN YOU REALLY SEE SOMEBODY SORT MAYBE TAKING STEPS FORWARD
I WANT A CONVERTIBLE SUPERCAR
THIS IS VERY TIMELY
IDEALLY TO DEMONSTRATE THIS
WE NEED JAMES MAY BUT SADLY HE'S BUSY TODAY
SO INSTEAD WE'VE GOT SOMEONE WHO LOOKS JUST LIKE HIM
WHICH MEANS THEY DRIVE SLOWLY AND THAT MEANS THEY CLOG UP THE BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE ALL SUMMER LONG
WHATEVER WE MADE HAD TO HAVE SLEEPING ACCOMMODATION
AND THEN THEY SAID ONCE WE'D FINISHED THEM
NOBODY WHO TOWS A CARAVAN HAS HAD ANY TRAINING
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE A BIT FRIGHTENED
I KNOW IT'S QUARTER TO
I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ACTUALLY A CARAVAN ENTHUSIAST
BUT UNLIKE ANY OTHER CARAVAN ENTHUSIAST
TWELVE AND THIRTEEN AND ONCE
THE RESULTS SO FAR HAVE BEEN
WE REJOIN THE ACTION AFTER SPENDING THE NIGHT TRYING TO SLEEP THROUGH WHAT FELT LIKE A FORCE NINE GAL
COATED WITH A CRUSHED
AND AS A RESULT OF OUR WRETCHED FAILURE
THIS IS IMPORTANT
BORDER CONTROL'S ON
IT'S NICE TO DO THINGS TOGETHER
IT'S ALL ABOUT BABY MO NOW
WE'VE GOT THE PRIORITIES NOW
TO SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER
WE USE IT TO BUY THEM A RELAXING NIGHT AWAY FOR THEIR ANNIVERSARY
THAT'S FOR MY DAUGHTER
YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS
MAN OF THE PEOPLE
I THINK IT FITS MY SKILL SET REALLY WELL
PARTNER NOT UP TO MUCH
ONLY THE BEST FOR YOU
WE CAN'T STAY LONG
WE NEED TO GET TO THE HOTEL
WE'RE HAVING AN EARLY NIGHT
SIX BILLION POUNDS THAT'S HOW MUCH NHS TRUSTS IN ENGLAND OVERSPENT IN SIX MONTHS
ENGLAND'S RUGBY UNION TEAM HAS ITS FIRST FOREIGN COACH
ADELE'S TWENTY FIVE IS OUT
BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO STREAM IT
LATEST REPORTS SAY UP TO TWENTY SEVEN PEOPLE DIED
IT'S A WEEK SINCE THE PARIS ATTACKS
VIGILS ARE TAKING PLACE ACROSS THE CITY TONIGHT
WHILE POLICE SAY A THIRD BODY WAS FOUND IN A FLAT THEY RAIDED
LET US GET ON WITH IT
FOUR CONTENDERS ARE ABOUT TO SIT IN THE BLACK CHAIR AND FACE BOTH THE GLARE OF THE LIGHTS AND THE
THERE IS NO APPEAL AGAINST EITHER
THEY GET TWO MINUTES OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND TWO AND A HALF ON GENERAL
I CAN'T WORK YOU OUT
I JUST REALLY NEED TO KNOW
WE NOT A DECENT DOCTOR
I KNOW THAT I'M PROBABLY THE LAST PERSON YOU WANT TO SEE RIGHT NOW
I'VE ASKED RONNIE TO GET HIM TO PHONE ME
AND HE STILL WANTS A DIVORCE
AN HOUR AGO I THOUGHT THAT KNOWING CHARLIE WAS ALIVE
IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN
HUSBAND
A SMILE OR A JOKE
I THINK THAT'S FINE
REALLY LOVE TO KEEP THEM
IT WAS A ROMANTIC VISION
AN ARTISTIC VISION
AND HE CERTAINLY GOT THAT RIGHT
WITH THE USE OF OLD FASHIONED FLOWERS AND TRADITIONAL GARDEN CRAFTS SUCH AS TOPIARY
WITH A COMBINATION OF NATURAL MATERIALS
LIKE THE STONE I'M WALKING ON
CREATED A COTTAGE LIKE ATMOSPHERE
IT'S THE EDWARDIANS TURNING THEIR BACKS ON WHAT THEY CONSIDERED TO BE VICTORIAN CONFORMITY
LET'S SAY ROWS AND ROWS OF REGIMENTED
AND I WASN'T SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT LAWRENCE WAS A KEEN PAINTER
UPON HIS RETURN FROM FIGHTING IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR
DO WE KNOW WHERE THE HOLIDAY IS
I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE WEARING
THIS VERY BUILDING BIGWOOD AUCTIONEERS AND VALUERS IN STRATFORD UPON AVON
IN ALL OF THEIR SENSATIONAL THEATRES
MADE OF HEAVY OAK
BUT THEY'D CALL IT RECYCLING THESE DAYS
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE
I DON'T BLAME THEM
THE TRAIN WAS THERE
THAT'S WHY IT'S IN VERY
SOMEBODY'S GOING HOME WITH A LOT OF MONEY
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS
BECAUSE THIS IS MY MUM'S DREAM AND SHE SAID
FIVE HELEN GEORGES
YOU WIN A COCONUT
WHAT COULD BE BETTER THAN HAVING HELEN GEORGE AS A PARTNER
BLACKPOOL IS THE VEGAS OF THE NORTH AND
NEVER MIND NINE TO FIVE
SHE WAS SLEEPING
CAN YOU AT LEAST BUY SOME SHOWER GEL TODAY
I WATCHED HIM LIFT A GUY MY SIZE
AH YOUR YOUR FATHER WAS RIGHT BUT
THE WAY YOU TREATED ALICIA
I CAN MANAGE WITHOUT SURGERY
YOU PROMISED ME YOU'D PAID IT
A DESCENDENT OF INDIAN ROYALTY
MADE A DOOMED ATTEMPT TO TAKE BACK HIS KINGDOM
AH THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THE FAMILY WERE GOING TO HOLD ON TO ELVEDEN
THE ONLY HOME SHE'D EVER KNOWN
JANUARY THE FOURTEENTH
FOR A WOMAN OF HER STANDING
FINELY DRESSED LADY
BUT HE DID IMPOSE A FINE
AH BAILIFFS CHARGED INTO HER HOUSE AND CONFISCATED SOME OF HER MOST PRECIOUS JEWELLERY
SHE NEVER HAD HER OWN CHILDREN TO TELL HER STORIES TO
AND YOU'VE GOT TO PROMISE ME
JUST AS IN LIFE
SHE LEFT MONEY IN HER WILL TO THREE SCHOOLS
THREE GIRLS' SCHOOLS
CRUISE SHIPS ARE EXPANDING
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR OUR MARINE ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD BE CHURNED UP OR INDEED DUMPED UPON
THERE ARE ABOUT
AND IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING INTERESTING THERE BEFOREHAND
THERE ARE SOME ABSOLUTELY RARE AND FASCINATING HABITATS
MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO
AND IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR
THAT LICENCE WAS QUASHED
SPOIL FROM THE RIVER TAMAR AND PLYMOUTH SOUND HAS BEEN DREDGED UP AND DUMPED OUT TO SEA OFF
PORTSMOUTH HARBOUR ISN'T JUST HOME TO THE NAVY
FERRIES AND CRUISE SHIPS
IT IS ALSO WHERE NATIVE OYSTERS LIVE
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING IS GOING TO PLAN BUT
BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ON SCHEDULE
WHAT THEY COULD REALLY DEAL WITH IS A COUNTRYFILE CALENDAR SOLD IN AID OF CHILDREN IN NEED
AND IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOURS YET
AH LAST YEAR'S CALENDAR WAS A RECORD BREAKER
WE HOPE TO RAISE EVEN MORE
MANY OF YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD THAT MY DEAR DAD PASSED AWAY A FEW WEEKS AGO
A LOT OF THE RARE BREEDS THAT HE HELPED TO SAVE STILL NEED LOOKING AFTER
HEARD AND HES DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB
MOST PEOPLE WILL BE PUTTING THEIR CATTLE INTO SHEDS AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
AND SEEING AS I KNOW WHAT YOU PAID FOR HIS DAD
MORE THAN IT WAS HIM
GO AND HIS PARKINSON'S WAS PROGRESSING
WHO HAVE HAD STROKES
SO THE FEEL GOOD FACTOR IS JUST NOT THERE
DANCING TO STAY IN THE COMPETITION
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY PETER AND
ON THEIR IMPROVEMENT IN TONIGHT
IT MARKS THE SPOT WHERE IRISH HISTORY WAS CHANGED FOREVER
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT ONE HAS REPLACED THE OTHER
I JUST COME DOWN FOR
I DO BUT I COULDN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY
HIS SISTER MARRIED NED LUSHENS
AND WHEN HE STAYED HERE
WHATEVER TROUBLES THEY'VE HAD
THIS IS FROM YOUR WORLD OR DOES IT SOUND AS THOUGH LIKE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
THAT'S NOT SO FAR FROM HERE
SO YOU HAVE BUT OF THAT
BUT I THINK OUR GENERATION
I CAN'T GO THERE
WE DON'T WANT TO GET STUCK IN THE PAST
BUT WE NEED TO LEARN THE LESSONS FROM IT
TO FIND OUT MORE
EACH WAS A LORD WARDEN OF THE SINK PORTS
USUALLY AWARDED TO A FIGURE WHO HAS DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF ON BEHALF OF HIS
I HAVE SEEN SOME
AND IF IT'S GERMAN
I WAS WATCHING THE ANTIQUE VO WITH MY MUM
WHEN I DID THE RESEARCH ON IT
LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE DETAILS
I WOULD HAVE THEN SAID
SOFT AND MALLEABLE
TRANSFORM IT INTO SOMETHING HARD
THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENTS IN OUR HISTORY
AND DESPITE CENTURIES OF EXPERIMENTATION AND SENDING SPIES TO CHINA
NOBODY IN THE WEST COULD DISCOVER THE SECRET OF PORCELAIN
IS MADE OF ATOMS
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MATERIAL IS TRANSPARENT
IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO PROMOTE ONE OF THE ELECTRONS TO A HIGHER ENERGY STATE
AND IT WOULDN'T BE FOR ANOTHER THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THOSE TWO MATERIALS WERE USED TOGETHER AGAIN
THE RENOWNED PHYSICIST
AND WHEN YOU BEND SOMETHING
IT'S BEING CRUSHED
AND SO THEY CREATED THE DENTAL ILLUMINATOR
SUPERCONDUCTORS SEEM TO HAVE A HUGE POTENTIAL
FROM THE UNLIKELY BEGINNINGS OF SAND AND CLAY
THEY FIGHT CANCER
AND HOW DID I DO IT
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
JUST OUTSIDE OF BRITAIN'S OLDEST RECORDED TOWN
IT PREDATES THE ROMAN INVASION
BUT IT'S ITS MODERN DAY INHABITANTS AND THEIR ANTIQUES WHO WILL BE THE STARS OF TODAY'S SHOW
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE
HUNDREDS OF THEM
SO LET'S CATCH UP WITH THEM RIGHT NOW
HE DIED IN APRIL
WHEN IT WAS IN STEPHEN'S HOUSE
WHAT MADE YOUR PARENTS BUY THIS BUILDING
OUR EXPERTS REALLY DO HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT
OUR EXPERTS HAVE MADE A CRACKING START
WE FOUND OUR FIRST ITEMS TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER
THIS IS WHERE WE UP THE TEMPO
WE WILL BE COMING BACK HERE LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
WE CAN RECYCLE ANYTHING YOU FIND AND WELL DONE
AND IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW BUILDINGS LIKE THIS DON'T HAVE TO BECOME RELICS OR MUSEUMS
SPANNING THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS
THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE
HOW HOW DID SHE GET ON WITH THE SAS
WORK BEGAN ON BRINGING THE INTERIOR BACK TO LIFE
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS WAS A HOUSE THAT WAS BOUGHT AND SOLD SO MANY TIMES IT DIDN'T HAVE
THE CURATORS HERE HAVE WORKED EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND OBJECTS THAT MAY HAVE ONCE BELONGED HERE LIKE
IT'S THE IMAGE OF THE GRIM REAPER
AND THE SAS WERE LOOKING FOR A HEADQUARTERS
HE MARCHED OVER TO THE STABLES
WHICH WAS WHERE THE OTHER GUYS WERE SLEEPING
MARCH THEM BACK OVER HERE
JUST OUTSIDE OF COLCHESTER
BETWEEN THE WARS
IT'S NOW TIME TO JOIN UP WITH OUR EXPERTS TO SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN TAKE OFF TO AUCTION
IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE TO THIS MAGNIFICENT LOCATION
AS WE HEAD OVER TO AUCTION FOR THE VERY LAST TIME TODAY
OPENED UP A BRAND NEW FACTORY IN CHELMSFORD
IT'S OVER TO MARK STACEY
IT'S THE MARCONI INTEREST
WHAT A WEEKEND OF FUN
FRILLS AND DRAMA IN BLACKPOOL
I NEVER EXPECTED TO MAKE IT TO BLACKPOOL AND
THIS IS JEREMY VINE SIGNING OFF
EVERYBODY HE WENT FOR A KEBA
AND THE CELEBRITY CRITICS WERE OUT IN FORCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA
AND THERE WAS FOUR OPINIONS WHO GOT TO DECIDE WHICH WAY THE SHOW WENT
AND THEY GAVE THEIR OPINION
DURING ALL OF THE WEEKEND'S EXCITEMENT
I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH DANCING WITH JABE
I HAD A VISIT FROM THE POLICE LAST NIGHT
SHE JUST TOOK IT
STAY WITH AUNTIE PEGGY
THERE'S OVER ONE HUNDRED
FROM FINE DINING TO FAST FOOD
FROM PUBS TO TAKEAWAYS
AND IN THAT COMPETITIVE CLAMOUR
TOMATOES HAVE FLOWERS
IT PRODUCES A MUCH BIGGER FRUIT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
I'LL BE INVESTIGATING SOME OF THE ISSUES ABOUT HOW WE WILL EAT IN TOMORROW'S WORLD
WHETHER WE SHOULD GENETICALLY MODIFY OUR FOOD
HOW DO WE TACKLE THE GROWING CRIME OF FOOD FRAUD AND
YOU CAN HAVE A VIRTUAL SOUR
THAT'S ALL INCREDIBLE AND HE MAY BE ON THE PATH TO THAT
A PLANT SO AMAZING
BUT IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE THIS IS A PLANT THAT WILL GIVE YOU CHIPS AND KETCHUP IN ONE
LET US HOPE THAT OUR TEAMS HAVE GOT THEIR WITS ABOUT THEM
BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST ANTIQUE FAIRS IN BRITAIN
THE FAMOUS COMPOSER
IT TOLD THE STORY OF TWO MEN
YOU MAKE NO DECISIONS
SO THE SIXTY MINUTES IS UP
LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU
LET'S FIND OUT RIGHT NOW
I'M JUST MESSING AROUND
I'VE GIVEN YOU THOUSANDS OF POUNDS
UNDER LIFTED A FINGER
I KNOW YOU ARE VERY BUSY
FROM THE HIGH STREET
I DO A BIG SHOP ON UM ON PENSION DAY
IT WAS QUITE REASONABLE
I'M GOING TO JOIN THEM
THIS IS FALMOUTH HARBOUR
THE WORLD'S THIRD LARGEST
DEEPEST NATURAL HARBOUR
WE WOULD NOT HAVE A SHOW
BUT IT CAME AT A PRICE
END UP STRUGGLING FOR SURVIVAL IN A THREE MAN DINGHY THAT WAS ONLY NINE FOOT LONG
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO US
WE TALKED ABOUT YOU
SHORT AND SWEET
THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM
WE'RE BRINGING YOU A COCKTAIL OF DANCE DELIGHTS
WITH PLENTY OF SHAKE
AND THE FLAMBOYANCE OF BRUNO BOY
THEY SURVIVED THEIR FIRST DANCE OFF TWO WEEKS AGO AND
GOT RELEASE EACH FINGER
IT CLOSED THE SHOW BEAUTIFULLY
AND BEING IN HOLD AND
THREE TIMES IVE BEEN AT THE TOP OF THE LA
AND HAS SINCE BEEN COVERED BY WILL YOUNG
HOW MUCH GOES UNREPORTED
WE LOOK AT ALL THE LATEST RESEARCH TO REVEAL THE REALITY OF A CRIME THAT SEEMS TO BE
AS PART OF MY ROLE AS CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER
IT'S ALSO A VERY RELIABLE NUMBER FOR US TO WORK ON
AN ESTIMATED FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE
THOUSAND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE WERE SEXUALLY ABUSED
THAT'S ALMOST HALF A MILLION
SHE WOULD TURN OUT AND SAY
I HONESTLY THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN FAMILIES BUT
TRY AND PROTECT MYSELF
ALMOST TEN PERCENT REPORTED BEING ABUSED BY THEIR OWN MOTHER
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUSH HIM OFF
WHEN THEY PERCEIVE A CHILD
THAT THEIR SEX DRIVE COMES BACK
DOES NOT APPEAR TO CHANGE OVER TIME AND IT'S AS CORE TO OUR BEING AS ANY OTHER SEXUAL ORIENTATION
IF YOU'RE HAVING THOUGHTS
STOP IT NOW HELPLINE
SO TO ESTABLISH SOME TRUST
ALL I'M SAYING IS IF MY PRIMARY CONCERN IS IS IN PROTECTING CHILDREN AND
IF WE START FROM THAT PREMISE
WHAT'S THE BEST TO PROTECT CHILDREN
THINK IN THE IN THE PUBLIC CONCEPTION
FOR OUR PURPOSES
THIRTEEN OR OLDER BEYOND THE AGE WHEN PAEDOPHILES NORMALLY TARGET THEM
SEXUAL THOUGHTS INVOLVING TEENAGE CHILDREN
UM BUT THEY MANAGE THOSE THOUGHTS
ALMOST THE SAME PROPORTION SAID THAT THE ABUSE ACTUALLY GOT WORSE AS A RESULT THAT THE CHILD WAS
WHEN RESEARCH SUGGESTS AROUND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE
THERE WERE FEWER THAN SIX
TERRIFIED CHILDREN GENERALLY DON'T COME FORWARD TO REPORT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM
IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABUSED
WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM
HE CALLED ME A LIAR EVERY SECOND WORD
I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A BOXING RING
OR WITH THE RIGHT SORTS OF SUPPORT AND INTERVENTION ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT'S COME FROM
BECAUSE THEY WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE ABUSER OF THE CHILD
WE SO WE SAVED ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN FROM BEING FURTHER ABUSED BY PEOPLE IN THE UK
THAT IS WHAT AN INDECENT IMAGE OF A CHILD IS
SO I THINK THERE WAS A NETWORK OF PEOPLE THAT WERE EXCHANGING PICTURES AND THE POLICE CAUGHT ONE OF
CASES LIKE JIMMY SAVILLE'S HAVE LED TO THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS COMING FORWARD
WE'LL INVESTIGATE CIRCA SEVENTY
WHICH IS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE
SO IT DOES MORE TO IDENTIFY
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TURN ROUND AND SAY TO ONE OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS
INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE THIS CRIME
TERRIFIED CHILDREN CANNOT ALWAYS HELP THEMSELVES
BRING HER ALONG
WE CAN PLAY LATER
IN THE DANCE OFF I DID THINK PETER'S DANCE DID COME UP A BIT
AND I TOTALLY RESPECT THE OTHER THREE JUDGES FOR THEIR OPINIONS
SO HENCEFORTH WHEN IT COMES TO THE DANCE OFF AND THEY SAY
THEY NEVER TELL US WHAT TO SAY
WE JUST COME OUT
IT'S BEEN CLAIMED IN SOME PAPERS THAT PETER DIDN'T ACTUALLY GET A STANDING OVATION AT THE END OF HIS DANCE
NOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CHATTER ONLINE ABOUT THIS WEEKEND'S SHOWS
AND LOTS OF YOU HAVE CONTACTED THE BBC ABOUT THE BLACKPOOL DANCE OFF AND THE WAY THE JUDGING WORKS
AND YOU CAN TELL FROM THE MARKS
ONE OF THEM IS PROFESSIONAL AND YOU KNOW
I WAS REALLY TIRED
THINK THE POSITIVE THAT I TOOK FROM IT WAS
SHE NEEDS TO KEEP THOSE DOWN
CREATE THE POSITIONS BUT BUT LET'S SEE THAT NECK
THINK THE WHOLE ACTION OF THE FOX SHOT WILL BE SMOOTH
WHEN YOU GOT A GRAND PIANO
AND EVERYTHING'S FREE
JUST WANT TO GO TO THE DARTS
I GOT SO HAMMERED
YOU'RE THE LANDLORD
I DON'T WANT A TUXEDO
UNTIL ONE NIGHT
SHE'S AWAY FROM HER FAMILY
ALSO HE DOESN'T GAIN WEIGHT
SO I GET WORRIED
AND WHEN I SAY ANYTHING
I WILL WELL I WILL COME AND SEE YOU VERY SOON
I CAN'T JUST IGNORE IT
IT MAY BE UNWISE BUT
AND IF YOU'RE ALL INTERESTED IN WHERE YOUR WIFE IS NOW
NOT ONLY DID HE HELP SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN REBUILD LONDON AFTER THE GREAT FIRE
GIVE US THEIR VALUATIONS
I FEEL LIKE I'VE DONE MY GOOD DEED OF THE DAY
BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT
THE LOFT DOES HAVE ITS ADVANTAGES
I'VE GOT MY FAVOURITES
YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT YOURS
FOR THAT BIG SURPRISE I KEEP PROMISING YOU
I LOVE THE ONE WITH THE MISSING EAR
EACH OF THESE HUGE ARMIES HAD NO IDEA WHERE THE OTHER SIDE WAS
TO FIND THE ANSWER
I HAVE TRAVELLED JUST SEVEN MILES DOWN THE ROAD FROM EDGEHILL TO THIS DELIGHTFUL ANCIENT MOATED
THE RETURN OF THE ROYALIST CAVALRY
IT WAS INDECISIVE
THE MONARCHY WAS RESTORED TO THE THRONE WITH HIS SON
SECOND BUT IT NEVER REALLY HAD THE SAME POWER
FROM THAT DAY ONWARDS
THE COUNTRY EMBARKED ON THAT DIFFICULT PATHWAY THAT HAS RESULTED IN THE DEMOCRACY WE
THE PARLIAMENTARIANS REALISED THEY COULDN'T WIN A WAR WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS
SO THEY SET UP AND STARTED TO TRAIN THE NEW MODEL ARMY
AND FROM THAT DAY ONWARDS
WE'VE GOT THAT BIG SURPRISE
IN THE BOX THERE
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED IT
JOIN US AGAIN FOR MANY MORE SURPRISES
WE HAVE THE MAN BEHIND THE MAGIC
AND MY FAVOURITE IS ALWAYS THE ONE WE DO AND
WE THAT WE DON'T PUT THAT TOGETHER UNTIL THE WEEK OF THE SHOW
SHE WORKED SO HARD
FOR A PERSON WHO HAS NEVER DANCED BEFORE
THE VOTE CLOSES AT SIX
HE IS THE GRAND MASTER OF THE BALLROOM AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE MOST BREATHTAKING MOMENTS
ON PAPER IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BE AMAZING BUT WHEN WE GOT THERE
THE MOST DRIVEN
BUT WHO WILL WIN
I WANT TO DO WELL
THE RESULT IS IN
ALL ON THE FLOOR AT THE SAME TIME
NOT THIS MUCH I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS
AT LEAST FOR HALF OF THE PERFORMANCE
THE MINUTE THEY FIND OUT I TRIED TO HELP YOU
MY PROTECTION IS GONE
IT'S DENISE FOX
IT WAS SELF DEFENCE
BEING CIGARETTE CASES
AND EIGHT LOCAL AUTHORITIES FROM SHEFFIELD TO MERSEYSIDE CAME UP TRUMPS
THEY OFFERED TO FUND THIS EXPERIMENTAL RADIO IN THEIR AREAS FOR A TRIAL PERIOD OF TWO YEARS
MAKING A BIT OF HISTORY THERE BRITAIN'S FIRST MAINLAND
LOCAL RADIO STATION
FROM MONTHS BEFORE
IT WAS BRILLIANT
THERE WAS JUST ONE PROBLEM
OBVIOUSLY FRANK GILLARD
WHO WAS THE FOUNDER OF LOCAL RADIO
A YOUTH PROGRAM
MUSIC PROGRAMS AND SO ON
AND SUDDEN IS
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHEN YOU HAD VINYL RECORDS
DOWNLOADING OFF THE INTERNET
WE'VE STILL GOT OUR FINAL COLLECTION
WE FOUND SOME REAL GEMS
WE ARE GOING OVER TO GILDING'S FOR THE LAST TIME
QUICK FLICKS AND TOP TRICKS STRAIGHT FROM THE TRAINING ROOMS
ONE OF MY FRIDAY PANEL IS KNOWN FOR HIGH KICKS
ONE FOR LOOSE LIPS
AND ONE FOR CHEEKY QUIPS
AND THEN WE GET YOU ONTO THE BED
WHO MOANS THE MOST
MY NEXT GUESTS ARE OFTEN KNOWN SIMPLY AS GG
NEVER MIND THREE TIMES SO I
WE'VE SEEN MANY ATTEMPTS AT PAO CAPEOGRAPHY
SO WHERE DO YOU GO IF YOU WANT TO HANG OUT WITH THE BIGGEST NAMES
ADOPT YOUR STRICTLY SMILES
LOVELY DANCERS NOW BEING THE ONLY TWO MALE CELEBRITIES LEFT IN THE COMPETITION
PETER AND JAY ARE DOING IT FOR THE BOYS
PEOPLE ON THAT DANCE FLOOR
THE NATURAL WORLD STILL HAS THE ABILITY TO SURPRISE US
FOUR MORE CONTENDERS ARE ALL SET TO TAKE TO THE STAGE TONIGHT
THEY SIT THERE NURTURING TWO HOPES
THAT THEY HAVE DONE ENOUGH REVISION TO GET THROUGH THE SPECIALIST RUN SAFELY
THAT THE QUESTIONS IN THE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE ROUND FALL KINDLY FOR THEM
THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO PREPARE FOR THEM
THANKS FOR WATCHING
I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU
PICTURES OF ME AND MY SON
I WONDER IF YOU COULD HELP ME
WE'RE A BIT LOST
IT'S WOMEN ONLY TANGO
I'LL SEE YOU THERE LATER
IF I CAN MAKE THIS WORK
I'LL BE HANGING OUT WITH SIR RICHARD BRANSTONS
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME
IF YOU WANTED TO SPEND TIME WITH ME
FORGIVE AND FORGET
THE STORY TELLING
NOTHING LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT COMMITMENT WILL DO
ESPECIALLY THE WOMAN
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT IT
WAS LACKING A LITTLE BIT
THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL
IT WAS SO SWEET I
AND PARTICULARLY IN SMALL DETAILS
BEEN SHAKING ALL DAY AND
HE MADE ANITA PRACTICE ALL THE ROMANTIC MOVES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
UNTIL SHE GOT IT RIGHT
AND FOR ALL THE BEHIND THE SCENES NEWS AND GOSSIP YOU CAN GO TO FACEBOOK
THEN THIS BECOMES THIS
NOW IT'S PROBABLY THE TOUGHEST ATHON WE'VE EVER HAD AND THAT'S REALLY JUST PRONOUNCING
BUT ALSO NOT TO BE AFFECTED BY ANYBODY ELSE
EVERYONE AT HOME
UNTIL THE BOTTOM COUPLE WILL RECEIVE JUST THE ONE EXTRA MARK
IN SEVENTH PLACE IS PETER
ANYONE YOU' LIKE US TO CALL
BECAUSE I WAS DOWN THE POST OFFICE THE OTHER THE DAY
WHAT DO I BELIEVE
YOU STAY AWAY FROM THAT FAMILY
WITHOUT YOU IN HER LIFE
SPEND SOME MORE TIME WITH HER BEFORE YOU DECIDE
WITH ALL OF MY HEART
AND I WILL PROTECT HER
DEALING WITH DIFFICULT PATIENTS
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
HE'S WINDING YOU UP
WE DIDN'T HAVE KIDS
SHE DIDN'T PRESENT WITH A HEAD INJURY
HOW ELM TREES ARE RETURNING TO OUR LANDSCAPE AND TIPS ON MAKING ELDERLYER CHAMPAGNE
AN AWFUL LOT MORE DRINKS WERE HOMEMADE LEMONADES
SOME WHITE WINE VINEGAR AND SOME LEMONS
LET'S BE MODERN
I DON'T WANT THIS FUNGUS IN MY SYSTEM
WHEN IT GETS FROSTED OR SNOWED ON IN THE WINTER
IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL
BUT OVERALL IT PREFERS A DAY LIKE THIS
THE LEMON SCENTED GUM
THIS IS EUCALYPTUS TETAA MEANING SQUARE STEMMED
IT IS TOO EARLY FOR THE FRUIT
THE WORLD'S SMALLEST AND THE WORLD'S LARGESTLEAD EUCALYPTUS TREE
PEOPLE SAY TO ME
THEIR USES AND FLAVOURS HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED IN CULINARY HISTORY
SO I WANT TO FIND OUT
AFTER ALL HE'S BEEN THROUGH
WHAT SORT OF MAN THAT SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD HAS BECOME
I WANT TO AUDITION FOR A BOY BAND
AND AFTER A PAUSE HIS FATHER SAID
SO I ALWAYS ENVISIT WHEN I GOT OLDER YEAH
SO THERE WAS NO REAL BIG PROBLEM AFTERWARDS
WHAT ARE YOU OUT HERE FOR
NOT TELLING A LIE
THAT'S THE POINT
SO I BUILT UP THE COURAGE
IT WOULD' HAVE NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE
WE NEED A MANAGER
MR WARREN CAME IN AND HE THEN DECIDED
SO HE WAS VERY WRONG
YOU PRACTICE THAT
I LOVE THE INNOCENCE
AS RAW AS YOU LIKE
WE WERE STRAIGHT OFF THE REST
AND IT WAS A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH
AND LET'S GET OUT BUY
IN A BOY BAND WAS A TOUGH TIME BACK THEN
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS KNEW YOU WOULD GET NICE NICE
I WAS HAPPY ENOUGH TO DO MY OOHS AND AS
THAT'S ALL I WAS THERE FOR
I THINK WE BE ON OUR SECOND TOUR BEFORE WE SAW ANY MONEY
IF YOU POSSIBLY COULD
GET BACK TO THE DRESSING ROOM AND GET YOUR HEAD IN GEAR
YOU'RE ALL BACKSTAGE WAITING
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT BAD
WE ALL HAD OUR OWN DEMONS
THINKING I'M MISSING THE CAR
PANICKED FOR FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS
BUT DID NOTHING FOR MYSELF PARTICULARLY
AND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT YOU
FIVE IN THE MORNING
SLOWLY BUT SURELY
I HUNG OUT WITH HIS DEMONIC PRINCIPALITIES
I WOULD HAVE KIND OF
BUT I JUST WANTED TO HEAR HIS VOICE
IT WAS FILLING ME YEAH
I KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM
I WAS HUNGRY FOR GOD BECAUSE OF WHAT IT WAS DOING FOR ME
I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF IT
THAT VESSEL GETTING FILLED UP BY THAT KNOWLEDGE
WE REALISED HOW LUCKY WE HAD BEEN
AND TO GET THAT OPPORTUNITY AND CHANCE AGAIN WAS VERY SPECIAL
HE WAS MY LITTLE BROTHER
AND I THINK THAT STORY ABOUT GOD HOLDING YOUR HAND UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO LET GO
REALLY I SUPPOSE
IS KIND OF LIKE THE SHANE I FIRST MET
AND THERE ARE SOME PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BEETLES THAT ARE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY AT THE MOMENT
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T
BY THE ACT OF PLANTING TREES
BUT AS TOM HAS BEEN DISCOVERING
IT'S HIGH IN PROTEIN AND A STAPLE FOOD FOR PIGS AND POULTRY
BUT WE CAN'T GROW IT HERE
BUT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS
THERE'S EVIDENCE OF A POPULATION OF THEM HERE IN ENGLAND
BUT TO BE HONEST
WE JUST DID WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO
CHARLOTTE AND I GREW UP ON THE FARM
UM WE ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO BE HERE
AND WE JUST DID WHAT WE FELT WE HAD TO DO AT THE TIME
THAT SEEMS TO BE GOING WELL
SIX PIGS AND SIX SHEEP
NOW WE'VE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY CATTLE
THE WOODLAND AROUND ME
WELL IT'S TAKEN A LIFETIME
WHICH IS SOME FIFTY
BUT IT'S THE PRACTICALITIES OF FEEDING INSECTS TO FARM ANIMALS WHICH IS THE TRICKY PART
SO THE POTENTIAL IS HUGE
AROUND ONE IN TEN
THE END END OF THAT WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER TOXIN LEVELS IN THE MEAT PRODUCTS THAT END UP ON OUR SHELVES
SO PEOPLE ARE HAVING A SERIOUS RETHINK ABOUT WHETHER THE LEGISLATION IS APPROPRIATE
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COMMONS IN THE COUNTRY AND IT'S KEPT IN SHAPE PARTLY BY THESE LOVELY
BUT LAST MONTH ALONE
AND WE HAVE A DRIFT TIME
IF YOU EVER COULDN'T FIND DAD
MAYBE MAYBE SOMETHING IS HAPPENING AND
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT HAS BEEN NOTHING
THERE IS NO SHAME IN LEAVING
HE WORKED SO HARD IN REHEARSALS
WHAT THE LANGUAGE
ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK
NOT JUST IN THIS TOWN BUT
THE SENSE I GET HERE
BEING UP IN THE NORTH
EVEN HIS PET DOGS
RETIRED TO MONTE CARLO
LIKE MANY OTHERS
WENT OFF TO WAR
ON HIS FIRST DAY OF ACTION IN NORMANDY
HE WAS KILLED BY A GERMAN SHELL
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR PAINTINGS
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER THE VALUE
WHAT IS IT AND HOW OLD IS IT
SCHOOL OLD SCHOOL FRIEND
HE'S MY THREE TIMES GREAT GRANDFATHER
AND HE'S ACTUALLY FROM
MAYBE WELL INTO THE THOUSANDS
WHICH IS GRATIFYING
GOING TO START HIS SECOND YEAR
CAME BACK WITH HIS UNIFORM ON
I'M NOT SURE IT'S UP TO THESE GLAMOROUS STANDARDS
ONCE YOU LET VALERIE IN
MAKES SHOPPING A CHALLENGE
I USED TO BE A BOXER
I'M GOING TO NEED DAYS OFF
WHERE IT WAS MADE
BUT THE CAVENDISH FAMILY
THE DEVONSHIRE COLLECTION OF ARTEFACTS HAS EVOLVED AND CONTINUES TO GROW
HERE IN THIS MAGNIFICENT SETTING OF CHATSWORTH
SO I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULAR PART OF THE COLLECTION WHICH
THE ELEVENTH DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE
AND HIS WIFE DEBORAH
I'M VERY IMPORTANT
YOU CAN FEEL THE HORSEPOWER GOING RIGHT THROUGH YOUR VEINS
LET'S BE CAUTIOUS
WE DO HAVE A HUSBAND
JOIN US AGAIN FOR MANY MORE SURPRISES
THAT'S AN ODD ONE
WAS WAS VITAL IN ONE SENSE
BUT YOU COULD PUT THE TWO TOGETHER
WE REVISIT A MOMENT IN HISTORY THAT STILL CASTS A SHADOW
BUT THEY WANT A RELIC
EARLIER THIS YEAR
AND IN SOME WAYS THE EXCITEMENT OF THE BATTLEFIELD
BUT IT DID HAVE A KIND OF PROVENANCE
AND THEY CONSPIRED TO MURDER ROB
I SIMPLY DO NOT BELIEVE THIS AND I'M SURE OUR EXPERTS WILL PROVE THE NONSENSE
HE WOULD HAVE CRACKED ME OVER THE HEAD WITH IT
I DIDN'T WANT TO RISK THAT SO YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT STRAIGHT AND
I'M NOT AN EXPERT
PENNY BRITTON TELLS US NOW ABOUT AN OBJECT THAT CAME HER WAY ALMOST BY ACCIDENT
AND I THINK IN THIS DAY AND AGE
WHEN THE MARKET IS SO VOLATILE
IT'S COMFORTING TO KNOW THAT
NO MATTER WHAT PRICES ARE DOING
YOU TAKE US THERE
WHERE DOES THE PIG FIT INTO ALL THAT
HERE FROM OUR ARCHIVES
IN THIS EPISODE
IS THE PERFECT ANTIQUES ROADSHOW MOMENT
YOU HAVE AN OBJECT AND IT SETS YOU OFF DOWN WONDERFUL TANGENTS INTO
OLD HABITS DIE HARD
THIS IS THE VALUABLE OBJECT
THE ANTI SLAVERY CAUSE
JOSIAH WEDGWOOD WAS A PROMINENT FIGURE
HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING OR COMMISSIONING ONE OF HIS MODELLERS TO MAKE THE CELEBRATED LITTLE
ONE OF THE WAYS
THE SEALS ON THE BACK OF ENVELOPES
YOU THIS WAS THE GREAT AND THE GOOD TRYING TO CONVINCE THE OTHER GREAT AND THE GOOD THAT
JOIN US TOMORROW WHEN WE WILL BRING YOU MORE MEMORABLE MOMENTS ON PRICELESS ANTIQUES
IT IS AN IMMENSELY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR HISTORY
THAT WOULD TAKE QUITE SOME TIME
OF LOVELY PEOPLE
WHO STEPPED OUT OF THE LOVELY PAGES OF JANE AUSTEN
BUT BEHIND IT OF COURSE
ONCE YOU START DIGGING
YOU REALIZE THAT THESE PEOPLE
FOR THE MOST PART THEY ARE TERRIBLY BORING
IT WAS JUST TRAFFICKING HUMAN FLESH
SEARCHED AROUND HIS FAMILY
THE TEN PADDLE MADE A FEW APPEARANCES
ON TONIGHT'S SHOW
ALL WILL BE REVEALED LATER ON
EVEN ON HIS TOUGH WEEKS YEAH HE GOES
OUR BACKSTAGE BEAVERS HAVE BEEN BUSY FACT FINDING FOR WEEKS
A BIG THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR GUESTS
JOIN ME TOMORROW
TONY EARLY THERE ARE NOW SIX COUPLES LEFT IN THE COMPETITION
OF THE REMAINING COUPLES
ONLY ONE HAS NEVER BEEN TOP OF THE LEADER BOARD
BUT OF COURSE THE MOST SHOCKING FACT OF ALL IS
ACROSS THE POND
YOU SEEM STRESSED I'M THINKING MAYBE WE CAN HAVE
EVERYTHING IS FINE
WE'RE REALLY BUSY HERE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT
ARID PARTS OF THE WORLD
EVEN WITHOUT ACCESS TO FRESH WATER
MAYBE DESERT FARMING IN THE FUTURE COULD BE ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO FEED OUR GROWING POPULATION
THE FREQUENCY AT WHICH THEY BUY
PEOPLE BUY MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF MILK
KNOW WITH BERRIES AND CHERRIES AND
DON'T SHOUT AT THE GUY
WHEN ANTS WANT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE AIRPORT
SO WHY DON'T WE FASTEN OUR SAFETY BELTS AND PREPARE FOR TAKEOFF
LOVE IT'S MODERN DESIGN
WHERE WE BOTH WENT
WE WE BOTH BELIEVE THAT YOU NEED TO SPEND MONEY TO MAKE MONEY
I'M LOOKING FOR FIVE
HE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING AFTER OTHERS
B I WILL GIVE YOU THAT
BUT WHEN SOMETHING IS SO SUBLIME
I WANTED TO BUT
AND I COULDN'T FATHOM WHY SOMEONE LIKE YOU WOULD WANT TO BE WITH SOMEONE LIKE HIM
POWERFUL AND THAT SAYS
I AM THE CHAMPION
WE WILL BE DELVING INTO THE PERSONAL LIVES OF A AND GIOVANNI
ROBIN WINDSOR PUTS GLEB UNDER THE MICROSCOPE
DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE
IT NEEDED ANGLES
IT'S MUSICALS WEEK AT STRICTLY TOWERS AND ALL OF OUR COUPLES HAVE BIG PLANS FOR SATURDAY
AS DO ALL OF OUR PROFESSIONAL DANCERS
AS THE OLD SAYING GOES
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS SO MUCH MORE TO LEARN
SHE IS THE QUEEN OF THE BALLROOM
AND SHE IS HERE WITH HER RULING
GORGEOUS MAN AND VERY GRACEFUL
T THIS WEEKEND ON STRICTLY WE ENTER THE SHOW STOPPING WORLD OF MUSICAL
AND SHALL WE FIND OUT WHAT BELTERS OUR COUPLES WILL BE DANCING TO ON SATURDAY NIGHT
AND WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER
IN THEIR INFINITE WISDOM
LOOKING AFTER THE HORSES IN THEIR DAY TO DAY TRAINING OF THEM
SEVERAL OTHER COMPETITIONS
BECAUSE I THINK YOU ARE SO BRAVE
FIRST PLACE WE GET TO
AND SPEND ALL THE MONEY ON ONE OBJECT
SO THAT'S THE POTTED HISTORY OF WEMS
LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT THE RED TEAM BOUGHT
THEY WANT THREE THINGS
WE SEE QUITE A FEW CUPS COME THROUGH IN DIFFERENT DEGREEING
THERE WE HAVE IT
THAT IS THE BEST MEDICINE FOR ME
WE'LL BE TALKING TO HER AND ALLI IN A MOMENT
DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE
AND I LOVED IT SO MUCH
PEOPLE NEED HELP
TOMORROW'S WORLD MADE THE MISTAKE OF FILMING IN COMMAND
WE WERE ONLY TWELVE
LET'S GET DOWN TO IT WITH AN AIR OF MYSTERY KIND OF WAY
SHOULD I NOTIFY YOUR RELATIVES NOW
HE SINGS THE TOP OF THE POP JINGLE IN BETWEEN EACH ONE
SHOTS WITH YOUR LEFT
OWEN'S TO BE CALLED THE GOLDEN TRUMPET
PLEASE TELL HIM TO STOP
THE PREVIOUS TENANT PAINTED IT
AND I LOVE THAT AND I CELEBRATE THAT
A GREAT SELECTION OF ANTIQUE SHOPS
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
BECAUSE IN THE SIXTY S
BUT MY MOTHER FOUND AN ADVERT ONE DAY IN THE PAPER
I JOINED THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM
WE HIT IT OFF IMMEDIATELY
IF YOU BUY THEM
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THAT
SO WE HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING CHEAP
I'VE BOUGHT SOMETHING I LIKE
COULD YOU DO SEVENTY FIVE
NOT ANOTHER MOMENT
UNLIKE THIS PICTURE
AT THE AUCTION WILL THEY GET THE PICTURE
YOU HAVE WATCHED THE SHOW
AND SO WE'VE TRIED TO BE GOOD MANNERED BY SAYING TEN
IT WAS A BIT TRICKY
ON THAT HAPPY NOTE
THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING
YOU HAVE MADE TWO HUNDRED AND NINE
IS THERE ANY MORE
AT FIFTY POUNDS WITH THE GENTLEMAN
POS IS THERE ANY ADVANCE
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE
I SAID I WAS COMING DOWN
I'VE COME DOWN TO MOVE YOU UP WITH ME
WE TALKED ABOUT IT ON THE PHONE
READING NEVER DOES GET ANY EASIER
NOT A GREAT DEAL
I DON'T FANCY GOING TO LIVE IN SPAIN
WHY FLOG THEM NOW
TRANSFORMING IT FROM NEGLECT INTO AN ARTISTIC INSPIRATION
THE PROFESSOR WAS AN ASTHMATIC
THE PROFESSOR'S SONS WERE BURSTING WITH CREATIVITY
AND THAT'S DOWN TO THE FAMILY THAT LIVED HERE
BECAUSE THEY TOOK THIS PLACE AS A BLANK CANVAS
WHO UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T BE WITH US TODAY
IN THE ROOM AT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY
ANY FAN ON TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY
AN ADVANCE ON ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY
THERE'S NO ESCAPE
NOT REALISING JUST WHAT WENT ON
THE FIRST NUCLEAR BUNKER I HAVE EVER BEEN IN
IT'S THANKS TO THE DEDICATION OF PETER AND HIS BROTHER BECAUSE A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF TWENTY
THESE ARE THINGS WE LOOK FOR
BUT THAT'S POSSIBLY THE MORE COMMERCIAL ONE
IF THESE THINGS BELONG TO YOU
WHEN THEYVE GONE
LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR MR JAMES BROWN
JUST OUTSIDE OF EDINBURGH
WOULD IT BE PERFECT
CALL THAT BOX SPLITS
THIS IS BOX SPLITS
I DON'T THINK SO
CRAIG REVEL HORWOOD WILL BE HERE
WITH ONLY A COUPLE OF DAYS TO GO BEFORE STRICTLY GOES TO THE MUSICALS
I DO BELIEVE THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF
TONIGHT OUR BACKSAGE AREA IS BURSTING AT THE SEAMS
WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME TO COAX A CERTAIN LADY OUT OF THE CLOSET AND HOPEFULLY SHE'LL DRAG A FEW
I DON'T THINK SHE HAS A FAVOURITE
UM EVERYBODY NEEDS THEIR FIX
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE SONG IS
IT REQUIRES A BIT OF A CONTEMPORARY FEEL TO IT AND WE WANT
EVERYTHING THEY SAY IS VALID
INCLUDING JEREMY VINE IN A SHOWER
YOU KNOW THE SCORE WHEN IT COMES TO FRIDAY
I'VE LINED UP A PRETTY GOOD SHOW FOR YOU
EARLIER ON VICKY GILL GAVE US A SNEAKY LOOK AT SOME OF THE FABULOUS COSTUMES FOR THIS WEEKEND'S SHOW BUT A
SO PLEASE WELCOME TO THE SHOW THE STRICTLY GLAM SQUAD
THANKS VERY MUCH
I DON'T THINK IT'S WORKING
AN APPEAL COURT OVERTURNED THE OLYMPIANS MANSLAUGHTER CONVICTION
FOR MANY CHILDREN THEY'LL BE THE MUST HAVE CHRISTMAS PRESENT
BUT HOW SAFE ARE HOVERBOARDS
THEY HAVE A FAULT THAT LEADS THEM TO EXPLODE OR BURST INTO FLAMES
THE MESSAGE FROM DAVID CAMERON TODAY
IT'S AFTER BRITISH JETS CARRIED OUT THEIR FIRST AIR STRIKES IN SYRIA
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS IT CAN'T BE RULED OUT
FOURTEEN PEOPLE DIED WHEN A MARRIED COUPLE OPENED FIRE AT A PARTY
I ONLY JUST FOUND OUT MYSELF
AND WHEN YOU'VE SATISFIED YOURSELF THAT HE IS SUITABLE FOR ME
THEN I HOPE YOU WILL COME TO THE WEDDING
IT'S NOT A GAME
YOU CALL IT A GAME CHANGER IF YOU LIKE
MAKE IT LIKE THAT
I WENT TO MY DOCTOR WITH THE SYMPTOMS OF OVARIAN CANCER
WE ARE FULFILLING ALL OF YOUR STRICTLY NEEDS FOR THE NEXT HOUR AND BOY
EVERY WEEK IS A BONUS NOW
I FEEL SO CHUFFED AND PROUD OF US ALL ACTUALLY I' GOT THIS FAR
BUT WE FINISHED IT TOWARDS MONDAY EVENING AND SOLIDLY ON TUESDAY
I DON'T KNOW WHY
MOST INTENSE AND MOST HONEST RELATIONSHIP YOU CAN HAVE WITH A PERSON
WE HAVE ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE EXTENDED STRICTLY FAMILY SNOOPING ABOUT
THE REMAINING SIX COUPLES ARE ALL PUSHING THEMSELVES TO THE MAX
LET'S HOPE THEY DON'T BOIL OVER THIS WEEK
WE GOT SOME NICE MARKS AND SO
I WONDER WHAT KATE GARRAWAY IS UP TO AT REHEARSALS
I DON'T THINK SHE LIKES IT
BUT SOMETIMES WE PERSUADE THEM OTHERWISE
UM WHO CAN SHUT DOWN A PERFORMANCE WITH A SINGLE ONE LINER
COME UP THROUGH THE RANKS
AND YOU COULD SEE IT
THE AUDIENCE HAVE FIFTY PERCENT OF THE VOTE AND
IT'S GEORGIA AND GIVANNI
FALLING OFF CHAIRS
FROSTY THE SNOWMAN
SO IT IS BUSY NOT QUITE AS BUSY AS BLACKPOOL
I'LL BE BACK ON MONDAY WITH THE TENTH COUPLE TO BE ELIMINATED
WE'LL HAVE ALL THE BACKSTAGE GOSSIP FROM THE WEEKEND
SINGING THE TITLE SONG FROM HER FORTHCOMING ROLE IN THE ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER CLASSIC TELL ME ON A
AND THEN PERHAPS THE GRAND FINAL ITSELF AND THE PROSPECT OF BECOMING THE NATION'S MASTERMIND
FOR REASONS BEST KNOWN TO THEMSELVES
FOR THE BLACK CHAIR ORDEAL
DO GO TO OUR WEBSITE BBC
I ONLY FOUND OUT MYSELF JUST BEFORE THE WEDDING
SHE IS MY BEST MATE
SO WE'RE MOVING UP NORTH
WE DON'T WANT YOU TO MOVE INTO A BRAND NEW EXECUTIVE HOME IN THE YORKSHIRE DALES
WE'RE GOING TO DO A DNA TEST
SHE'S GOT HER OWN LIFE NOW
AND IT WAS DAMAGED
AND THEY EXPECT TO FIND ITEMS IN PERFECT ORDER
SO HAVING THAT LETTER WITH IT
IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP A RECORD OF WHERE FAMILY POSSESSIONS CAME FROM
ASSUMING YOU KNOW
HE WAS SIGNING THINGS ALL DAY LONG
ON THE SIDE OF A LIMITED EDITION PRINT
TALK TO RELATIVES
RUMMAGE AROUND IN BOXES OF OLD PAPERWORK
LOOKING FOR INVOICES
BILLS OF SALE AND RECEIPTS
AND ALSO PHOTOGRAPHS
AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING
THIS IS WHY HE WAS THERE
THIS IS THE PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM BEING THERE AND THIS IS THE PROVENANCE OF WHERE IT CAME FROM
AND I SEE ALSO A LETTER
WHEN HE WHEN HE PASSED AWAY
COMPACT CAMERA FOR TAKING LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHS
PORTABLE AND GOOD QUALITY
FRESH TO MARKET
YOU'RE TALKING PREMIER LEAGUE THERE AND THE COLLECTORS WILL PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE RIGHT CAMERA
WHEN I SAY RIGHT CAMERA
AND I WAS PROBABLY BEING A BIT MEAN
BASED ON SIMILAR ONES THAT WE'VE HAD
BUT WITH THERE'S LOTS OF BUYERS FOR THESE AND THEY'RE ALL PRIVATE COLLECTORS AND THEY'RE A PASSIONATE
SO IF YOU IF YOU COME FROM THE NORTH
AND WE PICKED UP HIS OTHER CAR
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TOY VARIETY
JUST A TINY LITTLE BIT
ANITA DOESN'T WANT TO GO HOME
LAST WEEK WE WAVED GOODBYE TO OUR MUSIC MAN
BUT YOUR DRAMA AND YOUR ATTACK WAS THERE
FEEL IT WAS REALLY WELL DONE
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY
ALL HANDS ON DECK
I WILL GET YOU NEW CLOTHES
LETTER BY LETTER
LET'S FIND OUT ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST ANCIENT PLANTS ON THE PLANET
IT ISN'T WORTH WHAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO GET TO GET IT
THEY'RE A VERY NATURAL FLOWER AND ESSENTIALLY
THE ONES THAT EVERYONE'S FAMILIAR WITH
BUT VERY OFTEN GETS A BIT MUDDY
SO IT'S FAIRLY SHADY
THEY CAN GROW VIGOROUSLY FROM A HEAD START
SO DEPENDING ON YOUR BUDGET
EVERYONE'S HEARD OF IT
AND THAT'S ALL FROM US TODAY
THE WORLD AND THE OLYMPIC GAMES
WHENLYMFORD CHRISTIE WAS PRETTY MUCH RETIRED FROM COMPETITION
BUT YOU KNOW HE WAS IT WAS JUST A REAL BUBBLY CHARACTER TO HAVE AROUND
PEOPLE SEE ME WITH MY EYES WIDE OPEN
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE ALIVE ANY MORE
THE GUY THAT WAS IN CHARGE OF WHERE TO DOPING
THEY LIVE ON THAT BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT
AND THIS THE BIT THAT
THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT HASN'T RECOVERED FROM THAT
PROBABLY YOU KNOW YOUR AVERAGE AGE WAS TWENTY SIX
THE SHADOW OF OF OF BEN JOHNSON AND WHAT HAPPENED HANGS OVER THE MOVEMENT
YOU KNOW I'M TEAM CAPTAIND FOR THE WOMEN
IF I GET SECOND OR THIRD
EARTH'S NEVER GOING TO BE AS GOOD
AND IF HE DIDN'T OF
IT MADE EVERYBODY QUESTION
THIS WAS OUR MOMENT AND
AND THIS WAS THE DAY THAT WE BOTH HAD TO PERFORM
WHO ELSE MAY HAVE TAKEN DRUGS
I FOCUS MY EARS ON THE GUN
DAR TO FIND ME TO GET THE MEDAL BACK
EVEN IF YOU'D WON
AND IT WAS LIKE
THAT WAS THE BOTTOM LINE
AND WE KNEW HIM AS A PERSON
IT WAS REPORTED
THE GATESHEAD RACE
HE PROBABLY WAS
AND YOU KNOW I PROBABLY THINK
HE IS SUSPENDED FROM ATHLETICS
I WAS NOT GOING TO ANOTHER OLYMPICS
I WAS DOING SO MUCH
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS ABOUT
THE QUESTION IS
I SUPPLY ALL YOUR NEEDS
IT MUST BE QUITE FRUSTRATING AT TIMES
IT'S LIKE ATHLETICS
CAN I TAKE A PICTURE
AND IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS
YOU'VE GOT TO OVERCOME THEM
IS THAT A RELIGIOUS AFFAIR FOR YOU
LINFORD CHRISTIE WHAT A PASSIONATE MAN
THOSE PASSIONS HAVE GOT HIM INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE
BUT I LOVE THE WAY HIS FAITH IN GOD IS SUCH THAT HE KNOWS GOD WILL COME THROUGH FOR HIM AND
AFTER NEXT YEAR'S RIO OLYMPICS
RARE ONES LIKE A JAGUAR E TYPE
FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW
TO FENTON HOUSE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
AND TO TOP IT ALL
SECOND AND TO THIS VERY DAY
COMES FROM THE BEAUTIFUL
ONCE THE ROMAN CAPITAL OF ENGLAND
I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT DOG IT IS
THEY DON'T ALWAYS DO IT
BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ESSAY OFFICE HERE
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE CHARGING COMMISSION ON THIS
IT REMINDS US THERE IS SO MUCH NORTH OF INVERNET
SLEEP DEPRIVATION GETS ANYONE
BECAUSE MY SON THAT I BROUGHT UP FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS CHANGED HIS PERSONALITY
BECAUSE THERE IS AN AGEING POPULATION
WE JUST HAVE TO WORK BETTER
THIS IS ABOUT EIGHT
BUT GOVERNMENT POLICY AND SPENDING HAS HELPED TO CUT CASUALTIES IN THE PAST AND IT WOULD BE GOOD TO
THINGS LIKE SUGAR BEET
MANY FARMERS ARE TURNING TO CROPS TO PRODUCE ENERGY
FROM THE FIELD TO THE FUEL STORES
WE OPEN AIR DRY IT FOR ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS
THAT THAT GOT RID OF A LOT OF THE SURPLUS
JUST SEVENTY MILES TO THE WEST
AH CHRISTMAS ISN'T FAR AWAY
AND THIS COULD BE THE PERFECT STOCKING FILLER
A PLACE IN THE SEMIS
I THINK YOU KNOW WE'LL PUT IN THE HOURS
WORK JUST TILL DAWN
GEORGIA AND GIOVANNI
BUT THE COUPLE IM GOING TO SAVE IS GEORGIA AND GIOVANNI
HOME TO THE ROYAL FAMILY HERE IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLAND
THE GOLDEN LION
BUT MY FATHER ALSO WAS A BIT OF A LAD AND HAD SOME NICE BLUE MOVIES THAT HE'D BROUGHT FROM
I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL
IT SHOWS JOHN BETTRAMAN I SUPPOSE AT HIS BEST
THE MAIN THING IS
NOT JUST OF STAGS
BECAUSE THEY DON'T TURN UP ON THE MARKET VERY OFTEN
ITS VERY INTERESTING
PEOPLE OFTEN SAY THAT
I THINK YOU KNOW
IN BURLINGTON HOUSE
AND THEY COLLECTED NATURAL PEARLS
SOMEONE ONCE SAID TO ME IT WAS LIMESTONE
MY MOTHER GAVE IT TO ME MAYBE TWENTY
BUT FROM WHERE THEYD COME FROM
THE ACTUAL SORT OF DESIGNS WERE CREATED BY PABLO PICASSO
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THE LAST EXAMPLE OF THIS THAT I SAW TURN UP
BECAUSE YOU'LL NEVER FORGET THAT ONE
DAMAGE CAN DETRACT FROM AN ITEM'S APPEAL
IT WAS ONCE A FORTIFIED HOUSE
THERE ARE ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT
IF YOU'RE BUYING A RESTORED PIECE FOR A RESTORED PRICE
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE DOING IS BUYING A RESTORED PIECE FOR A PERFECT PRICE
IF A POT HAS BEEN RESTORED AND YOU BITE INTO IT
IF YOU BITE ONTO A PIECE THAT'S NOT BEEN RESTORED
IT'S REALLY QUITE HARD
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE GROUND COLOURS ARE VERY PLAIN
ESPECIALLY WITH THE SORT OF SUNSET RED GROUND TO IT
THEY'LL EITHER DO IT THEMSELVES OR THEY GET IT DONE PROFESSIONALLY
THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT WILL ASK
THE ONE THING THEY WILL ASK IS WHETHER IT TICKS BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT THE MAINSPRING IS STILL
AS LONG AS THAT STILL GOES
IT'S GOT MORE VALUE
THE RESTORATION WILL COME BACK AND IT WILL CHANGE IN TIME
BUT BECAUSE MOREROFT IS SO EASY TO RESTORE
WE'LL NEVER KNOW
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED IT
GET BUYING AND HAVE SOME FUN WITH ANTIQUES
AH REVEAL WHAT A STRONG IMAGE THAT IS AND
AND WALKING TOWARDS IT
WHAT DAY IS IT TODAY
I'M NOT BEING RUDE
I HAVE HODGKIN'SLYMPHOMA
HE'S GOT TWO OTHER KIDS ALREADY
WHAT'S JOE GOING TO SAY
I AM THE VIRGIN QUEEN
I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO BE ELIZABETH THE FIRST
IT WAS A MISTAKE
I'M USELESS AT EVERYTHING ELSE
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR A REGIMENTAL DINNER
HE ENJOYED IN THIS ROOM A PERFORMANCE BY THE GREAT ITALIAN COMPOSER
CRACE HE HAD NOTICED IN HIS LONDON HOME IN CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE AS AN
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
YOU FIND THAT IN A SHOP
ALL OF THEM HAVE NOW BEEN DANCING FOR FOR A WHILE SO YOU
AND WE ALL SAW WHAT HAPPENED ON THE DANCE FLOOR THIS WEEKEND
IT WAS IT WAS SHOCKING
WE HAD AN INCREDIBLE
OURSELVES AND THE FLOOR AND
ALL WITH VERY DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES AND DIFFERENT JOURNEYS
THAT SORT OF THING
I LIKE TO THINK
UM AND BECAUSE OF THAT
I THINK WE'VE GOT A RICHER SOCIETY FOR IT
AND A RICHER SOCIETY
SO ANYTHING TO DO WITH GARDENING
IT WAS THROUGH THE ROOF
BUT THE GREAT THING WAS
IT MAY HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE SEVENTY S
OAKS INDIGENOUS TO OUR SHORES
SO YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY IT SELLS WELL
BUT IN NO WAY COULD THIS EVER BE CALLED PUB MEMORABILIA
IT'S A PAINTING BY A GREAT ARTIST DONE THROUGH FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
IT'S ITS PASSPORT
AND AND I TRAIN DOWN AT A GYM IN STOKE ON TRENT
WITH ALL THE BIG BOYS
WHO GENERALLY GIVE ME A GOOD BEATING
THINGS LIKE THAT SO
I MEAN I THINK THAT'S AN ACCOLADE YOU KNOW THE WEDDING PRESENT OF THE SIXTY S
BEHIND EVERY GOOD MAN
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM GERMANY
WE HAVE MET SO MANY NICE PEOPLE
SUCH A VARIETY OF PEOPLE
IT CATCHES YOUR EYE AND IT'S QUITE AMAZING HOW MANY COMMENTS YOU ACTUALLY GET WHEN YOU
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY'S SHOW
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND US
CHOCKS AWAY OR WHAT
THIS PLACE WAS HOME TO THE LANCASTER BOMBER AND WAS USED AS A LOCATION FOR THE
AND WE WERE FED UP WITH DOING WHAT WE WERE DOING SO WE THOUGHT
WE ACTUALLY HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
SO WILL OUR TEAMS TODAY SORT VICTORY OR SIMPLY FINISH UP ON THE CUTTING
STARTED TO LEARN TO FLY
I FINALLY GOT TO THE POINT THAT I KNEW WHAT I WANTED TO DO
INCLUDING A GARDEN RAILWAY I MEAN
I DO IT JUST FOR THE GRANDCHILDREN
WEIGHT IS ALSO REALLY GOOD
WE'VE JUST BOUGHT THAT LOVELY
MY TEAM LOVE BIRDS
I'M HEADING OFF A FEW MILES SOUTH TO A PLACE THAT PLAYED ITS PART IN A DEFINING MOMENT
WELL IT'S NOT A BIG SPEND
NEVER HEARD OF THEM
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY
FOR OUR TEAMS OVER AT THE AUCTION IS
IT'S NOT QUITE A DREAM LOT FOR AUCTION
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
NOW FOR THE BLUES
LASTLY UM WE FLIP TO SOMETHING THAT IS ENTIRELY PLEASURABLE
THEY ARE GOING TO BE IN BIG TROUBLE
YOUR SCRATCH BUILT DOLLS' HOUSE
THAT WAS A WISE MOVE
WILL I GO TO PRISON
I BELIEVE IT COMES FROM GOD
IT'S TURNED HER WITS
WHATEVER SHE'S DONE
I GRABBED HER TO TRY AND STOP HER
BUT SHE PUSHED ME OUT OF THE WAY
SHE RAN OUT ONTO THE STREET
THE ONLY TIME I GO OUT IS WITH HER TO DO THE SHOPPING
I'M NOT GOING BACK
HARDLY SAID A WORD
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE
THIS WING IS OVER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD
MY BROTHER AND I STARTED WHEN WE WERE SORT OF EARLY TEENS
AND OF COURSE PEOPLE FIND THESE THINGS
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING
I REALLY DO LIKE IT YEAH
AND WE GOT THE BOXES
WHILE WE WERE UP HERE IN THE AREA
I HAVE TO ADMIT
AND I HADN'T SEEN IT
IT'S A WONDERFUL ESTATE
WE'VE GOT MATURE PLANTEDUP LIME TREES EITHER SIDE THIS WONDERFUL AVENUE
IT WAS THE VISION OF ONE MAN
IT IS FASCINATING TO GO BEHIND THE SCENES
WHEN I FIRST SAW IT
BECAUSE YOU THINK
WHAT CAN YOU SAY
I'M IMPRESSED BY THIS
THROUGHOUT THE FAMILY
THE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN RIGHT
BECAUSE SO OFTEN
JOIN ME FOR MANY MORE SURPRISES THE NEXT TIME
EVERYONE'S GONE HOME HAPPY
I THINK ANYONE CAN WIN THIS YEAR
WHEN HELEN LEFT UM
IN A BREAK FROM IT TAKES TWO TRADITION
IT'S NOT THE SAVED COUPLE KEEPING MY SOFA WARM
IT'S ONE OF OUR OTHER SEMI FINALISTS AND
JUST THE SIMPLE STUFF LIKE
HE'S ACCUMULATED A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND
BUT IF YOU'RE A BIT RUSTY
WE'VE HAD SOME RI CAKER SO FAR
THIS WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD TIME TO WHEEL THE GIGANTIC JUKEBOX OUT
I FELT LIKE I WAS SAT WATCHING A MUSICAL
A WEST END MUSICAL YEAH
AND I THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT IN THE COMPETITION
IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION
IT'S COMPANY POLICY
HE'S A LITTLE BOY
NOW WE'VE LEARNT THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO CATCH HIM TEN MONTHS BEFORE THE ATROCITY
SECURITY AGENTS TRACKED HIM TO ATHENS
BUT HE GOT AWAY
HE WANTS TO BE THE NEXT US PRESIDENT
BUT THERE'S BEEN AN OUTCRY OVER DONALD TRUMP'S CALLS FOR A COMPLETE HALT TO MUSLIMS ENTERING
HE'S DEFENDED THE REMARKS
AFTER THE STORM
SIX FIGURES OR SO
IS IT THE RARITY
THE MATERIAL IT'S MADE FROM
ON THE FACE OF IT
AND THAT'S WHAT PUSHES THE PRICE UP
THE JAPANESE WILL COPY THE CHINESE
THE CHINESE WILL COPY THE JAPANESE
THE SUMMIT WAS ALWAYS BELIEVED TO BE
LADIES WERE NOT ALLOWED UP ON THE SUMMIT UNTIL THE MEIJI PERIOD
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PRICE
WHICH IS THE ENERGY
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO EXCITING
SPACE UNDER THE ARMPITS
OPEN YOUR BODY OUT
AS WE CALL THEM
I'LL PLAY A COUPLE THIS SIDE AND WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT AT THE END
THERE'S GREAT WEALTH OUT THERE AND FOR A LONG TIME
THEY WERE DENIED THEIR CULTURE
THEY DESTROYED THEM
IT WOULD HAVE MADE THREE
UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR STUFF
ONE THING THAT I WOULD NOT BE COLLECTING AT THE MOMENT IS CHINESE PORCELAIN
WHEN I WAS A BOY
I HAD ALL MY GOLDFISH IN THE POND
SO IT MAKES LITTLE SCRATCH MARKS
SOME PEOPLE HAVE THEM IN LITTLE BOWLS
I'M SO GLAD THE SALE OF THOSE LOVELY THINGS MEANT THAT SANDRA COULD RETRACE SOME OF HER FATHER'S
BRING IT ALONG TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY
I HOPE YOU HAVE ENJOYED THE SHOW
ON BARGAIN HUNT
IT CERTAINLY DOES
IT'S ACTUALLY MY JOB
I WORK FOR A WATER AUDIT COMPANY
AND PRIOR TO THAT
LET'S TAKE A QUICK SQUINT AT WHAT'S COMING UP
YOU'D HAVE YOUR SERVIETTE
THAT WORK IS CHILD SERVICES ORIENTATED
I HAVE DONE SINCE I WAS TEN YEARS OLD
IT HAS THAT LOOK
I'M NOT SURPRISED
ON MAYBE ALL OF IT
BUT IN CASE NOT
NO GREAT SWEAT THERE
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS
BUT IF I SCRATCH THAT BASE
IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN POPULAR
IT'S A POUND SHOP
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE IS A LITTLE HIGH
I'M NOT RISKING THAT
THAT'S ONE OPTION
WE'RE HOPING FOR A SLIGHTLY MORE SERENE EXPERIENCE
OR SHE MAY HAVE HAD ATTACHED TO A CHATLINE
IT'S AUCTION TIME
THAT'S A GOOD PRICE
YEAH THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT IN
IT LOOKS ENCHANTING AND INVITING
THEY WERE IN LOVE AND THEY GOT MARRIED BUT
STONEY PUTS A PISTOL TO MARY ELEANOR'S HEAD AND DEMANDS SHE STOPS THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS AT ONCE
SHE RETREATED TO HAMPSHIRE TO LIVE A QUIET LIFE
BUT THE GROUNDS ARE A WONDERFUL PLACE FOR FAMILIES TO VISIT
THAT IS YOUR FIRST DOSE
BUT WHO ARE THE BRILLIANT PEOPLE BEHIND THOSE INCREDIBLE VOICES
WEEK THE HEAT IS MOST DEFINITELY ON
DID YOU KNOW THERE ARE ONLY TWO DANCES IN THE HISTORY OF STRICTLY THAT HAVE FAILED TO ACHIEVE
THEY ARE THE SAMBA AND THE RUMBA
BUT WHY ARE THEY SUCH TRICKY DANCES
THEY LEARNED TO DANCES SO THEY LEARN
SO THEY ARE OUT OF JAIL AND ON THE RUN
WHAT IF I WERE TO SWEETEN THE DEAL
BY CROSSING YOUR PALMS WITH SILVER
NEXT TIME YOU PHONE ME
WOMEN LOVE A MAN IN UNIFORM
HE WAS LATE FOR HIS FIRST CATWALK
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU HEARD ALL OF IT
VIS-VIS LONELINESS AND PIZZA
I'VE HAD A WORD
IF I WAS ON WITH THE CHIPS
NOT JUST WITH ANTIQUES
IT'S ALWAYS THE QUALITY THAT SHINES OUT
DON'T FEEL THAT YOU NEED TO THINK IT'S WONDERFUL AS WELL
I THINK IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE HAD A WATER
YEARS AND YEARS OF KNOWING
BECAUSE ONCE YOU DO SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T RUB IT OUT
WONDERFUL DEEP RED
THANKS TO ITS CURRENT OWNERS
DECORATION CAN APPLY AS MUCH TO THE PERSON AS TO THE HOUSE
NOR FOR THE WATERS
I DON'T THINK SO
ACCORDING TO THAT LOT
WHICH IS MINUS TWELVE
GOING RATHER WELL AT THE MOMENT
I SAW THE POLICE CAR
I PAY FOR A GARDENING SERVICE THROUGH THE LETTING AGENT
YOU EVEN HAVE A BIG GERMAN CHRISTMAS MARKET IN BIRMINGHAM
YOU MAY HAVE GOT SOME IDEAS FROM THE VICTORIANS BUT
WE GAVE YOU CHRISTMAS
I DON'T NEED YOUR PITY AND I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY AND I DON'T NEED YOUR COMPANY
I KNOW WHAT IT IS
NO POINT IN KEEPING HER WAITING
VITA WAS A WEALTHY ARISTOCRAT WHO JUST MISSED OUT ON INHERITING HER BELOVED FAMILY HOME OF KNOLE
I THINK OUR EXPERTS ARE WRONG
IT'S WORTH GIVING IT A GO
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS AUCTION
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT EVERYBODY'S TASTE
THERE'S BEEN OTHER THINGS TOO
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO BETRAY MY COUSIN
I SOMETIMES WONDER WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO BEN IF I'D BEEN THERE FOR HIM
AND AND AND THE LAST THING I WANT IS FOR BOBBY TO THINK HE'S DONE WRONG
I'VE GOT TO GET BACK HOME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BE NICE AND COSY WITH THE OLD BILL
MOST SUSPECTS WERE UNKNOWN TO POLICE
FLOODED FOR THE SECOND TIME IN DAYS
WORST HIT WAS THE VILLAGE OF GLENRIIG
SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE
YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE
THAT OFTEN CAME IN BIG CASES
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF EYEPIECE AND A NUMBER OF SLIDES AND THINGS THAT WENT WITH THEM AND LOTS OF
DAVID WAS JUMPING AROUND LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW WHEN IT SOLD
YOU'RE FEELING SLIGHTLY UNWELL
KNOW QUITE HAPPY FOR THEM TO HAVE A GO
THERE'S A CERTAIN ELECTRICITY RUNNING THROUGH YOUR BODY
IT OPERATES MUSCLES AND THE LIKE
THE CONTRIBUTOR IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ITEM THEY BRING
THEY WERE JUST GREAT TO TALK TO
SOMETIMES STINGRAY SKIN CASE
UM TO HAVE THAT AND
THEY WERE MADE IN LARGE QUANTITIES
WE'D ALREADY HAD HUGE INTEREST
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
SHOWN THEIR HAND BY BOOKING THE TELEPHONE
PROBABLY A BIT MORE
IF THEY'RE IN BOXES
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS IN VERY PLAIN BOXES
HE PATENTED THE CYLINDRICAL SLIDE RULE IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
IT WOULD LOOK QUITE FUN AND QUIRKY ON SOMEBODY'S DESK
AND I'M AFRAID I'M STILL NONE THE WISER
MY FATHER TRIED TO EXPLAIN A FLAT SLIDE RULE TO ME
IT WAS A HIGH QUALITY
BEAUTIFULLY MADE INSTRUMENT
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY
THE RESULT WAS REALLY DOWN TO TWO BIDDERS IN THE CELL ROOM WHO WERE RELUCTANT TO LET IT GO
TEAM HAS THEIR OWN WAY OF SNIFFING OUT QUALITY ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES
BEING VERY BUSY
A WATCH OPENER MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA
WHAT ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT A MAGNET FOR
BRONZE IS NOT MAGNETIC
IT'S ALSO USEFUL WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING THROUGH JOB LOTS OF JEWELLERY
WHERE WE WENT OFF TO THE YORKSHIRE DALES
THEN THAT'S WHERE IT REMAINED
I AM A COLLECTOR OF OLDER THINGS
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND US
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY'S SHOW
BUT IF IT MEANS SPENDING MORE TIME WITH YOU
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME WHETHER YOU'RE GAY
STRAIGHT OR BI CURIOUS
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
WE MET IN LONDON
SHE TALKED ABOUT
THERE WAS A CONNECTION
WE GIVE TO CHARITY
AH SO I'M WORKING THERE NOW
GOD HELP THE STAHOLDERS
HOW IS IT THAT A GREAT
YOU HAD A PLAN AS TO WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO TODAY
WE'VE GOT ONE ICE
I DON'T THINK WE WERE TRIPPING OVER GREAT THINGS
I THINK THE BASKET
THE ANSWER IS CHARITY
NOW FOR THE BLUES
THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING TODAY
I'M STILL WINCING AFTER THAT
ESPECIALLY WITH MY BEST MATE
THESE ARE REMEDIES FOR A SORE THROAT
THEYVE HAD TO START THE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING
YOU CAN SUBMIT YOUR QUESTIONS VIA SOCIAL MEDIA USING
OUR COUPLES WILL BE BACK IN THE STRICTLY BALLROOM WITH NOT ONE BUT TWO DANCES
IT IS VERY EXCITING
BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE FRIDAY WITHOUT A FRIDAY PANEL
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT LEN AND CRAIG
THE DANCE OFF LAST WEEK
THEY ARE DOING A TROPICAL LATIN THEME
WE LAUNCHED THE FIND CRAIG'S TEN PADDLE APPEAL
SEND THEM TO US
NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS TRIO
YEAH MORE OFTEN THAN NOT YEAH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO EVERYONE'S FAVOURITE PARTY DANCE THE
NO COUPLE HAS MANAGED TO SECURE A FORTY IN ALL OF STRICTLY HISTORY
IT'S TIME NOW FOR MORE HIGHBROW CHOREOGRAPHY ANALYSIS WITH MY FRIDAY PANEL
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOINGNNA TAKE TO GET HER A TEN
MAKE SURE YOU WATCH THE SEMIFINAL TOMORROW SIX
IT'S THE LEGEND THAT IS MRRYAN ADAMS WITH YOU BELONG TO ME
FOUR CONTENDERS WITH US THIS EVENING WHOSE CONFIDENCE MAY HAVE BEEN BOOSTED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BY
AND IF THERE IS A TIE AT THE END OF IT
AND YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON TWITTER AT
THANKS FOR WATCHING
I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN ALIA'S PERSONAL LIFE
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT
IT'S A FLE CHOICE
BAKING POWDER AND LEMONS
SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME
I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT MRS CAR HAD ENTERED
WE NEVER GET A CHANCE TO CHAT LIKE THIS
MAYBE HE' RIGHT FOR ALL
SHE'S NOT PREGNANT
YOU NEED TO BOOK THE MOSQUE NEXT WEEK
THIS FAMILY IS A DISGRACE
WHERE YOU'LL ALSO FIND TERMS AND CONDITIONS
SO IT'S DOUBLE THE DANCING
ONE OF OUR COUPLES WILL NOT MAKE IT THROUGH TO NEXT WEEK'S
IT'S A VERY APPROPRIATE TITLE
ANITA HAS A BABY GRAND PIANO
BUT HERE SHE IS
JUST ONE WEEK AWAY FROM THE FINAL
CAN SHE GO ALL THE WAY
I'VE GOT SOME OF THAT IN THE BACK OF MY KITCHEN CUPBOARD
SO IF YOU DO TOO MUCH OF ONE THING
IT WAS IT
IT WAS FULL OF CONTENT
IF YOU'RE NOT THERE
YOU ARE VOTING FOR YOUR STRICTLY COME DANCING TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN FINALIST
NOW THINGS HAVE BEEN GETTING A LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL UP HERE OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS SO
FIND OUT WHO IT WILL BE IN TOMORROW NIGHT'S RESULTS SHOW AT SEVEN
NO QUESTIONS ASKED
IT'S JUST I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE A BIT MORE
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA
I'VE STILL GOT SO MUCH TO LEARN
AND A BOTTLE OF WHITE
IT'S ALWAYS A BIG
YOU WOULD LIKE IT TO BE DENSE
BREAK IT INTO CLOTHES
IT TENDS TO STORE MUCH BETTER THAN HARD NECK
AND YOU CAN GET SOME FANTASTIC RESULTS
BUT ALL THAT CAN BE DONE LATER
YOU CAN GROW A GOOSEBERRY
THEY NEED PLENTY OF SUNSHINE
GET ENOUGH OF THAT AND A WONDERFUL WINE IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE
SAME WINEMAKING METHOD
HE PRODUCED A PRODUCT THAT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO FOOL THE FRENCH
THERE'S LESS IN CHAMPAGNE
WHAT A GREAT WAY TO END TODAY'S PROGRAMME
WITH MY MUM PRESIDING ALL OF IT OVER ALL OF IT LIKE THIS CALM CENTRE TO THE STORM
DON'T WORRY IF OTHER PEOPLE ARE ALL AGAINST YOU
IF YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT
I HAD TO LEARN TO
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOUR YOUNG BOTTOM NEEDS
THREE IS ENOUGH ONE UP
WHEN WE HAVE DRIVEN THESE ARAB JOHNNIES
FIVE OR SIX HOURS
MEET UP AND SEE WHO IS GOING TO TAKE WHO
NOT BECAUSE OF DISCIPLINE BUT BECAUSE OF SELF DISCIPLINE THAT DRIVES YOU ON
THREE OR FOUR MINUTES
EVEN AT THE END
BETTER AT THE PROFESSION WE WERE ALL INVOLVED IN THAN I WAS
INDECIPHERABLE AND EXOTIC LANGUAGES
THERE MUST BE SOME WAY AROUND THIS PROBLEM
GIVEN MY NATURE
SOME OF THE TERRIBLE PIECES OF TERRORISM YOU WOULD HAVE RESISTED BUT
BUT WOULD I HAVE BEEN A SUPPORTER OF THOSE WHO
FELT THEY HAD TO TAKE MORE STRENUOUS ACTION
IT WAS A QUASI RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE
MAYBE IT WAS A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE
I TOOK DOWN LIBERALISM LIKE AN OLD COAT HANGING IN THE CUPBOARD
I CAN SAY I WAS WORKING IN IN IN THE AREA OF INTELLIGENCE YES
IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY
IT WAS THE ERA AND THE COLD WAR
BUT MORE THAN THAT IT WOULD BE IMPROPER FOR ME TO SAY
BECAUSE I PROMISED I WOULDN'T
AND WE MUST HAVE THIS GUY
I USED TO HAVE NIGHTMARES THAT SCARED ME TO DEATH
AFTER THE ELECTION RESULT WE HAD THIS YEAR
THROUGH FORCE OF PERSONALITY
AND I GOT THE HANG OF IT
I'M VERY NERVOUS WHEN I SPEAK
AND I KNOW THAT
WE ALL HAD A GOOD CRY
THE TAX OFFICIALS HAD BEEN ROUND TO CLOSE DOWN THE ORGANISATION BECAUSE WE HADN'T PAID OUR TAXES
THAT'S THE KIND OF EXCUSE YOU BEAT YOU MAKE
IF ONLY THOSE SOME OF THOSE OTHER PEOPLE HAD SEEN WHAT HE'D SEEN
WITH THE THOUGHT
AND WE LOVE HIM FOR IT
PICKED UP A SHOVEL
THE MULTIFARIOUS DIFFERENCES OF HUMANITY ARE
THE GREATEST REVELATION OF THE DIVINE
WHATEVER DIVINE YOU HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IN
AND OF OUR HUMANITY AND THAT
ONE OF THE TWELVE LOST TRIBES OF ISRAEL
AND SINCE THEN HE HAD BECOME CONVINCED THAT ISRAEL MUST DO EVERYTHING IT CAN TO HELP JEWS WHEN THEY
THEY REALIZE THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEED THINGS UP
AFTER SECRET TALKS WITH THE PRESIDENT
NOT ONLY FROM HIS ARAB ALLIES
BUT ALSO FOR HIS OWN PEOPLE
AND NU OF COURSE HAD TO SAY
KNOWN AS THE BUTCHER OF ADDIS ABABA
BECAUSE HE CAME TO POWER IN A MILITARY COUP IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
IT WAS RUMOURED THAT HE HAD PERSONALLY SUFFOCATED THE FORMER EMPEROR HIGHLY SELASSIE WITH A PILLOW
NOW THIS WAS THE TIME OF THE COLD WAR
TAKE THIS PHONE
AFTER THE HOLOCAUST
MOST ISRAELIS WERE DETERMINED NEVER TO LEAVE JEWS TO THEIR FATE AGAIN WHATEVER THE DIFFICULTIES AND
BUT HOMELESSNESS IS A YEAR ROUND EMERGENCY
AND IT'D BE REALLY GREAT IF YOU COULD TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO HELP AS WELL
I WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED
AND NOT REALLY KNOWING WHAT TO DO
BUT I WOULDN'T SLEEP IN SHOP DOORWAYS BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL SAFE
I THOUGHT THAT SOMEONE COULD COME ALONG
THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT CRISIS
WHO OFFER IMMEDIATE HELP TO PEOPLE SEPARATED FROM HOME AND FAMILY
NOT JUST EMERGENCY HELP AT CHRISTMAS
THEY'VE ALL TURNED UP HERE TODAY TO ASK OUR EXPERTS THAT ALL IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH EVERYBODY
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE STARTED TO PUSH A FEW BUTTONS AND RECORD SOME ANTIQUES
IT LOOKS LIKE ANITA MANNING IS OUR FIRST EXPERT TO THE FLOG IT
SOMETHING LIKE A HIGH CLASS RAFFLE
SO HE SET ABOUT RIPPING OUT ALL THE EARLIER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ROBERT ADAM RESTORATION FROM THE FIRST
BUT OVER THE YEARS
IT WAS AN ART AT THAT TIME
IT GOT THERE QUICKLY
ONE COUPLE MUST LEAVE TONIGHT
THE JUDGES HAVE SCORED AND YOU HAVE VOTED
BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM IS GUARANTEED A PLACE
FIRST TO DANCE AGAIN FOR A PLACE IN THAT FINAL
I'M JUST JUDGING THIS ON THIS ONE DANCE
NOTHING THAT BEEN NOTHING THAT COULD BE IN THE FUTURE OR IN THE FINAL
IT WAS TOTALLY CLEAR
AND THAT COUPLE
REGULARLY WITH THE COURT
AND ALEX WAS WORKING WITH LINKE
AND THEN MOVED AWAY FOR HIS OWN WORKSHOPS
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO
WHICH IS ALWAYS REFERRED TO AS PALE AMBER
IT'S ALL RELEVANT
BECAUSE IM I A LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT THE HOUSE
WE'VE GOT A WONDERFUL THING HERE
WE'RE GOING STRAIGHT TO GLASGOW
WOULD YOU LIKE TO READ IT FOR ME
WHAT IT'S USED FOR
HOW DO YOU GET THEM
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
MADE OF RAM'S HORN AND
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL SELL IT
THE FAMOUS SERVANT OF QUEEN VICTORIA
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR HER FATHER'S MEDALS
AND WENT THROUGH SOME PRETTY TRAUMATIC TIMES
WHEN I SAW THE POSTER
BUT WE'VE GOT THE NEXT BEST THING
AS THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH HISTORY
AND IT'S REALLY
MARKETRY IS BASICALLY A PICTURE
BUT THIS MAN WASN'T PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN HIS BAYONET
THE QUALITY OF IT
IT MIGHT BE WORTH X
THEN IT MIGHT BE WORTH TEN TIMES X
WHO PERHAPS HASN'T JUST GOT THAT EXAMPLE
CRAFT OR POTENTIAL ENEMY AIRCRAFT
IT'S VERY UNUSUAL FOR US TO SEE ITEMS THAT HAVE SURVIVED FROM AN EARLIER PERIOD
SO THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE DIGGING AWAY IN THE MUD
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD LOOK
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF TODAY'S SHOW
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED IT
DO JOIN US AGAIN SOON FOR SOME MORE INSIDE INFORMATION ON TRADE SECRET
I ALWAYS DO BUSMAN'S HOLIDAYS MYSELF
THAT'S THE SORT OF ENGLISH VERSION
YOU WANT SOMETHING MADE
YOU WANT IT MADE BY THE BEST
AND IF NOT THE BEST
CERTAINLY THE SECOND BEST
YOU DON'T WANT IT JUST KNOCKED OUT
YOU WANT TO SAY TO PEOPLE ROUND THE DINING TABLE
UM I HAD SPOKEN TO BEFORE THE SALE
LIGHTER CAMERAS AND MUSICAL CAMERAS AS WELL
I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED
FANTASTIC ENGINEERING IN EVERYTHING THEY PRODUCED
THE MOST FAMOUS NAME IN CAMERAS
AND BUT I WOULD JUST SAY TO YOU
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING WISE TO THAT
SO WHAT CAN BE DONE
IT IS WORTH TRYING TO NEGOTIATE
BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY AMENABLE TO NEGOTIATION
NOT TO EVERYONE'S TASTE
WHICH IS UNBELIEVABLE
YOU CANNOT GET A ONE OFF SUIT ANYWHERE FOR THIRTY
WHICH ISN'T TO EVERYBODY'S TASTE
A REGULAR TO THE VALUATION DAYS UP IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND
WHICH IS NOVELTY SALT AND PEPPER POTS
IT'S A NEVER ENDING PROCESS
YOU BUY SOMETHING BUT
ALWAYS TRADE UPWARDS
BRING IT ALONG TO ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY
THAT MAKES SENSE
HIS FATHER DESIGNED THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT BUT IT'S WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE THAT INTERESTS ME
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS ACTORS OF THE DAY
IT'S OUR JOB TO TELL THEM
SO LET'S GET ON WITH THE SHOW
AS THEY WERE KNOWN BUT DESPITE DULLL COLLEGE'S HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT'S WORTH
IT'S NOT DRAMATICALLY VALUABLE
I NEVER DO ANYTHING WITH IT
ONE OF HARRISON'S TIMEPIECES WAS SUCCESSFULLY TRIALLED AND APPROVED BY THE BOARD
THAT CLOCK THAT FINALLY NAILED IT
THEY PIECED TOGETHER ESSENTIAL INFORMATION FOR NAVIGATORS
AND HE MADE JOHN FLAMSTEED THE FIRST ASTRONOMER ROYAL
TOWNS AND CITIES AROUND THE WORLD KEPT LOCAL TIME
WHERE DELEGATES DISCUSSED WHICH OF THE HALF A DOZEN OR SO MERIDIANS CURRENTLY BEING USED COULD BE
IT WOULD DROP DOWN
THIS A BIT OF A WHOPPER
AND IT USES A LENS RATHER THAN A MIRROR TO FOCUS AND GATHER LIGHT FROM THE OBJECT BEING OBSERVED
IT'S THE LARGEST REFRACTING TELESCOPE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
BECAUSE THEY COULD SEE IT
BUT THAT WAS INTERRUPTED BECAUSE OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR
THE LAST OBSERVATION TO BE DONE HERE WAS MADE IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR
THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND IT'S A FASCINATING INSIGHT INTO EARLY SCIENCE
AND I HOPE MY LITTLE VISIT TODAY HAS INSPIRED YOU TO COME AND TAKE A LOOK FOR YOURSELF AT THIS
LIGHT POLLUTION FROM THE CITY AND VIBRATION FROM TRAINS STARTED TO AFFECT THE GOOD WORK BEING DONE
AND MAYBE A FIXED RESERVE JUST BELOW
IS TWENTY YEARS AGO
MY FLATMATE DIED AND HE ACTUALLY WAS LEFT
GOT TO BE HAPPY WITH THAT
THE AQUARIUM LIGHTER
BELONGING TO ALAN
YEAH WE ALL DONE
HE'S REALLY EXCITED
EXCITED ABOUT THE WEDDING
I SUPPOSE I COULD FIND YOU SOMETHING TO BE GOING ON WITH
BECAUSE THIS IS THE GREATEST STORY IN THE WORLD
AND I DON'T WANT NONE OF YOUR FLASHING LIGHTS
WHAT YOU ON ABOUT
I'M AS SICKA AS YOU ARE
CAUSE I'M TELLING YOU NOW
THEN THEIR CUSTOM WOULD BE ESPECIALLY WELCOME
WHAT IF SHE WAS RIGHT
WE BOTH GOT A LITTLE CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT
I'VE JUST COME TO SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING
IN THE MEANTIME
THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE
AND I AM NOT GOING TO LET YOU PUSH ME AWAY THIS TIME
SO SAY INSPECTORS IN ENGLAND AND WALES
THEY THINK POLICE FORCES ARE ON THE VERGE OF BEING OVERWHELMED
THE RED CARPET FOR THE STAR WARS PREMIERE IN LA LAST NIGHT WAS HALF A MILE LONG
A BOMB THREAT WAS REPORTEDLY MADE
POLICE SAY THEY'LL SEARCH EVERY CAMPUS
I WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH YOU
I DO COLLECT IT MYSELF
THE DEEP PURPLES
IT OBVIOUSLY MEANS THEY ARE NOT PRODUCING ANY MORE WARES
WORKING EXTREMELY HARD
AND I'M SURE IT WAS THE CONDITION OF PAT'S TILES THAT SENT THEM THROUGH THE ROOF
FORMED A MOVEMENT LATER TO BE KNOWN AS THE ARTS AND CRAFTS MOVEMENT
WHICH CHAMPIONED TRADITIONAL SKILLS AND METHODS TO MAKE BEAUTIFUL HANDCRAFTED THINGS
AND ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME
HE ENJOYED POTTING SO MUCH HE MADE SOME GREAT ERRORS BUT ALSO MADE SOME GREAT GLAZES
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT HANDCRAFTED ITEMS
SO IF YOU'RE HUNGRY FOR MORE
FROM THE AGE OF ABOUT TWELVE
UM MY FINAL YEAR
I HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING
AS LOVELY AS BATEMANS IN STAMFORD
HAVEN'T WHAT'S THE THEORY
IT'S BECAUSE I'M ON MY OWN NOW
UNLESS SOMEONE CAMPS OUTSIDE MY DRIVEWAY
I'M JUST GOING TO LET YOU KNOW
WHEN HARRY MET SALLY
WE'LL BE CATCHING UP WITH THE WEEKEND'S LEADER BOARD TOPPERS
SO LET'S SEE HOW GEORGIA AND JAY ARE GETTING ON WITH THEIR NO RULES
AT THE WEEKEND THEY FACED THE MUSIC AND BOY DID THEY DANCE
PLUS AN EXTRA SPECIAL TREAT WE HAVE THREE FAMILIAR FACES FROM THE CLASS OF TWENTY FIFTEEN
JUST A REMINDER
IF YOU WANT TO SEND A VIDEO MESSAGE TO ANY OF OUR FINALISTS
YOU'VE STILL GOT TIME
TO THE GREAT CANADIAN WILDERNESS
IT IS THE OTHER WAY ROUND
AND OBVIOUSLY BEN WITH HIS PHYSICAL CHALLENGES
ONE OF HIS ARMS
THAT ARM WAS ON HIS RIGHT ARM
OUT FROM THERE TO THERE
SO WE FINALLY ARRIVED
SO OVER THREE DAYS
LET'S GRIEVE AND GET ON WITH IT
HELP ME ALL THE TIME
HIS LEFT ARM WAS USELESS
AND THEY WERE SAYING
HIS LUNGS COULD EXPAND
THEY'VE GOT THE MOST INCREDIBLE TEETH THAT GROW THROUGHOUT THE LIFETIME OF THE ANIMAL
BEING A SOLDIER
YOUR PRESENCE IS ENOUGH OF A PRESENT FOR ME
IT MAKES NO SENSE
I MIGHT HAVE PAID EXTRA FOR THAT
BUT IT'S MY BIRTHDAY
YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS HAD RUBBISH BIRTHDAYS
I WANTED A BOUNCY CASTLE
CHARLIE DIMMOCK WAS DOING A MEET AND GRA
I DON'T LIKE TO TIE MYSELF DOWN
WELCOME TO MY BIRTHDAY INVITE PAGE
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DUMP ME
IT WAS AMICABLE
NONE OF THAT TRYING TO LOOK SEXY CRAP
IT'S THE MOST EMBARRASSING INVITE PAGES I'VE EVER SEEN
WHEN I WENT TO MY SISTER'S BIRTHDAY
THERE WAS THE DAY TRIP TO HIGH BARNET
THEN YOU STOLE MY CAKE
WE'VE ALL LEARNED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE ITEMS THAT HAVE PASSED THROUGH OUR HANDS
I WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH YOU
I THINK THIS IS WORTH TWO
YOU DID SAY BEFOREHAND BUT
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID
SAY THE RIGHT THINGS
IS THAT YOUR FATHER
I'M NOT THE NERVOUS TYPE
I COME FROM LANCASHIRE
I THINK THE FIRST TIME YOU DO A PROGRAMME
UM AND IT'S UNUSUAL
YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS AND PERHAPS YOU DON'T LET THE REAL YOU COME OUT
AND OF COURSE MY BRAIN WAS SWIMMING AROUND THINKING
WHAT HAVE I SAID
WHAT VALUATIONS HAVE I PUT ON THESE THINGS
IN FRONT OF THE CONTRIBUTORS
THE WHOLE THING WAS JUST FANTASTIC
THE ADRENALINE KICKS IN AND IT WAS JUST BRILLIANT
WHAT SORT OF VALUE COULD YOU PUT ON THESE
I'VE PROBABLY HAD TOO MUCH RED WINE
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC
THE QUALITY OF THE CLAY
SO HE SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE MORE PROFITABLE TO ACTUALLY TURN TO PRODUCTION OF ART POTTERY RATHER THAN
THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC
THE WONDERFUL FORMS AND COLOURS OF HIS DESIGNS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
PROLIFIC DECORATION EVERYWHERE
BUT TO GET A REAL SENSE OF HOW REVOLUTIONARY HE WAS
THE LAST ONE OF THESE THAT SOLD
AS WELL AS THE BOOKS THAT WE HAVE IN THE LIBRARY
AND IF WE FIND ANYTHING ELSE IN SCHOOL WE CAN SELL
BUY SOME ANTIQUES
HERSCHEL THE CELEBRATED ASTRONOMER PHOTOGRAPHED BY JULIA MARGARET CAMERON
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY'S SHOW
FASHION CHANGES ALL THE TIME AND WE FOLLOW THE FASHION AND WE PLUCK FROM THE PAST
AND THIS IS WHY THESE CUFF LINKS
THE LATE NINETEENTH AND VERY EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY
WITHOUT ITS STORY
THESE DAYS THE WEDDING RING IS ABOUT AS BEJOED AS A MAN WOULD GET BUT HISTORY TELLS
HIS MEANING EVERYTHING THAT LOOKS VALUABLE ISN'T NECESSARILY SO GOLD OR NOT
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL
NOT ALWAYS BUT MOST OF THE TIME
ENGRAVED FOR LADY CONSTANCE TRENER
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS
AND ANY GOOD AUCTION HOUSE
PEOPLE WANT DIFFERENT THINGS
HAVE I GOT A SEMIPRECIOUS STONE IN MY HAND
PICK UP A PIECE OF GLASS
BUT STILL RELEVANT
WHEN SOMETHING IS VERY PRECIOUS LIKE THAT
I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE A LITTLE MORE PREPARATION
I HAVE SOMETIMES
AND I KNOW LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH QUALIFICATIONS
IF THAT'S PERTAINING TO ME
COULD YOU GET ME HER ROOM NUMBER
BUT THIS IS ALL ON A CARD
THAT WAS NOT MY FAULT
JUST THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE
SHE'S BEEN THE SEAMLESS SEAMSTRESS WHO NEVER BREAKS A SWEAT AND ALWAYS HAS A CHEEKY
TO THE DIZZYING HEIGHTS OF THE STRICTLY FINAL
IF YOU WANT TO ASK A QUESTION
THE OTHER STARS OF THE SERIES CAN REMINISCE
I JUST MISS PASHA
WE WERE SUPPORTING EACH OTHER
WHAT IS AMAZING
AS IT'S NEARLY CHRISTMAS
FAVORITE MOMENTS FROM OUR FAVORITE DANCES
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT GET EMOTIONAL
GETTING CANCER IS NOT LARGELY DOWN TO BAD LUCK
WE'VE ALREADY GOT DAFFODILS IN DECEMBER
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT
IT MAKES SUCH A BAD IMPRESSION
IS NOT PRICE SENSITIVE
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE BALANCE BETWEEN PATIENT CARE AND THE PRACTICE'S NEED TO CAPITALISE ON
FOUR MORE CONTENDERS TONIGHT
EACH SHARING THE SAME AMBITION TO GET THROUGH THIS ROUND
PLENTY TO PLAY FOR

THANKS FOR WATCHING
I DON'T KNOW IF HE KNEW WHERE THE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX WAS KEPT
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE USED THE KEY I NEVER TOLD HIM
I JUST WANTED YOU TO REMEMBER HIM AS YOUR HERO
IT'LL BE FANTASTIC
WHENEVER I GO AND PICK HIM UP
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME THEYARSE MY PITCH FOR THE DRAGON
IT'S HARDLY A SURPRISE
KIND BUT LONELY SNOWMAN WHO JUST WANTS TO HELP PEOPLE AND MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
CHOCOLATE FOR BREAKFAST
I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO OLIVIA
WE HAVE LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AND LAUGHED
THE VOTE IS NOW FROZEN
ELLIE GOULDING WILL BE PERFORMING
AND NOW YOU HAVE A DRIVE
YOU CAN TAKE ON DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
YOUR FAVOURITE COUPLE NEED YOU TO VOTE FOR THEM
PICK UP THE PHONE OR GO ONLINE AND VOTE FOR YOUR WINNERS
I HE SAID IT BEFORE
LET ME TELL YOU
FOR ONE FINAL TIME
BECAUSE THEY ARE AMAZING DANCERS
THE BEST IN THE WHOLE WORLD
THERE IS A PLACE FREE
SHE HAD A TERRIFYING WAKE UP CALL WHEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A BRAIN ANEURYSM
I WAS ALWAYS IN TROUBLE
ALWAYS SPEAKING MY MIND
AS A PARENT NOW
BUT THERE ARE SOME SMARTER WAYS IN WHICH TO WORK HARDER
WELL I LOOKED AS THOUGH I HAD HAD A FIGHT WITH MIKE DYSON
I WAS ALL SWOLLEN
WE HAVE TO TAKE YOU TO A E
AT THE SAME TIME JUGGLING THE PHONE
AND THEY TOOK ME STRAIGHT IN
I'M I'M SORRY TO HAVE TO TELL YOU
YOU HAVE A BRAIN ANEURYSM
I NEED TO GO TOMORROW
SHE WAS NOT IN CONTROL THEN
SHE WAS ON A ROLL WITH GETTING THINGS ORGANISED AT THE CLUB AT THAT TIME
WHICH KIND OF SURGERY DO YOU HAVE
WHERE DO YOU HAVE IT
ONE PERSON WAS SAYING TO ME
AND ANOTHER PERSON WAS SAYING TO ME
HAVE A COIL FITTED
WHICH IS A NONEVASIVE WAY OF DEALING WITH IT
AND THEY SORT OF PITCH TO YOU WHAT THEY THEY THINK YOU OUGHT TO DO AND
PITCH TO EACH OTHER
WHEN THAT HAPPENS TO THEM
AND SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE
YOU WANT TO GIVE UP YOUR JOB
YOU WANT TO TRAVEL THE WORLD
AND THAT TERRIFIED ME
THAT SOMEONE ELSE WOULD BE ADVISING THEM AND HELPING THEM
PHRASES LIKE WORK LIFE BALANCE
UM AND I WAS RUNNING A BUSINESS
I FELT I HAD A RESPONSIBILITY
I BECAME COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED FROM BEING UP ALL NIGHT WITH HER
MY CHILDREN AND MY WORK WERE THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN MY LIFE
YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DISTRIBUTE IT MORE EVENLY
IN THOSE FEW DAYS WAITING FOR THE OPERATION
AND JUST TO GIVE ME THE STRENGTH TO KE TO CARRY THROUGH
TRUE AND IT WAS INTERESTING WHEN I WENT DOWN FOR MY SURGERY
I REFUSED TO BE WHEELED DOWN
AH SHE GIVES EVERYBODY A CHANCE
WE OFFER NO ADVICE
AND IN THE APPRENTICE
AND HALF OF THE SHOW IS ABOUT HOW PEOPLE HANDLE THEMSELVES IN THE BOARDROOM
THEY EITHER HAVE RUN A BUSINESS
THEY'RE RUNNING A BUSINESS
OR THEY WANT TO RUN A BUSINESS
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT TO WANTING TO BE AN EMPLOYEE
ONE OF WHICH I AM
IT WAS QUITE A PROTRACTED PROCESS
THAT'S A GOOD DEAL
THERE WAS NO REAL TEAMWORK
PEOPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE DEBT THAT THE CLUB WAS IN
IT WAS A VERY MALE DOMINATED ENVIRONMENT
IF THEY DON'T FEEL ENGAGED WITH THE CAR
IF THEY DON'T SEE THE FUTURE
A DREAM REALLY FOR WEST HAM
SUPPORTERS WERE ANXIOUS AND NERVOUS
OR TOTTENHAM BRINGING WEST HAM IN
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT WELL ONE DAY
YOUVE GOT SCIENTISTS
MAKING SURE EVERYTHING IS PERFECT
THAT'S WORTHY OF THE ACCOLADE OF OF HAVING A FIFTY FOUR
WHO DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR SKILL OTHER THAN THEIR ABILITY TO WORK HARD
WHO PUSHED THEMSELVES
WHO WENT OUTSIDE THEIR COMFORT ZONE
PEOPLE THAT I COULD LOOK UP TO
WHO IS HEAD OF OUR CHURCH
HE OFTEN POPS INTO US ON CHRISTMAS DAY FOR A DRINK
THAT'S NOT TRUE
WHETHER SHE LIKES IT OR NOT
IF I WASN'T A CHILDREN'S ENTERTAINER
IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR YOU
SAY CONCERNS US ALL
WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT
STOP THE BAR SERVICE
I GET CARRIED AWAY
YES I COULD DO THAT
WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING MY ACT
I HEARD PEGGY SAY IT'S THE WETEST NIGHT SHE'S EVER SPENT
WELCOME TO FLOG IT
NO JOB AND LITTLE MORE THAN TEN POUNDS IN HIS POCKET
THE ANSWER IS ELEMENTARY
AND IF THERE'S ANY MISBEHAVING
AND HOPING TO SELL THEIR ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES ARE THE GOOD PEOPLE OF PORTSMOUTH AND THE
AND THEY'RE HERE TO ASK OUR EXPERTS THAT ALL IMPORTANT QUESTION
I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS A PRINT
THERE IS A RARITY FACTOR
AND A WONDERFUL PIECE OF FAMILY HISTORY
AND THERE'S NOTHING GREENER THAN ANTIQUES
THEY'RE NOT SECOND HAND OR THIRD HAND
AND IF YOU'VE GOT ANY UNWANTED ANTIQUES
THREE MAGNIFICENT ITEMS ALL READY TO SAIL OFF TO THE AUCTION ROOM
MY EXPERTS HAVE JUST MADE THEIR CHOICES
LET'S PUT THOSE VALUATIONS TO THE TEST
NOT ONLY IS IT A WORK OF ART
BUT IT'S ALSO A WEAPON OF WAR
WITH THE FIJIAN THROWING CLUB
BELONGING TO GEORGE
GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN
WAITING FOR FLOG IT
AND I TELL YOU WHAT
UNTIL ONE PORTSMOUTH MAN CAME ALONG
HE RECOGNISED THE PLIGHT OF THE POOR KIDS IN RAGGED CLOTHING
BUT ALSO TRADITIONAL SKILLS AND CRAFTS
LIKE SHOEMAKING AND CARPENTRY
AND HE WOULD SAY
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM GERMANY
THAT'S QUITE A CHANGE
FROM SHEFFIELD TO PORTSMOUTH
IS GETTING IN A BIT OF NICHE COLLECTING
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT I'M GOING TO BE OUT AND ABOUT
IT WAS HAPPENING BEFORE MY TIME
AND I THINK THEY
UM THESE TREES ARE PERFECT BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT TO COME OUT
IT'S PRETTY TIGHT
WHICH WAS DEVISED BY OUR FIRST BISHOP OF TRURO
HE SAW PEOPLE YOU KNOW ENJOYING SINGING CAROLS IN A FOLK SETTING
IN COMMUNITIES AND PUBS
AND HOW DID IT COME ABOUT
YOU WERE A DOCTOR
I NEED A WINTER SALAD WITH HAKE
AND I HAD TWENTY FOUR HOURS
SO TURKEY AT CHRISTMAS WAS A GIVEN
THEY DON'T GIVE ME TOO MUCH INFORMATION
WE GET LOADS OF SUNLIGHT
IF IT'S GETTING COLD AND THAT
MOMENT I'M GOING TO BE JOINING MATT AND THE PEOPLE OF COVER ACT FOR THE BIG SWITCH ON
BUT BEFORE THAT
I JUST GOT TO THE STAGE WHERE IT'S LIKE
IT BECOMES A JOB AND IT GETS A TAD TEDIOUS
VERY GOOD LUCK TODAY BECAUSE NOW IS THE MOMENT FOR ME TO GIVE YOU THREE HUNDRED SMACKERS EACH
AND THAT'S WHERE BASICALLY OUR LOVE OF ANTIQUES CAME FROM
I WANT YOU TO THINK INTERNATIONAL CANDLESTICKS
SO THAT'S A BIT OF A CONFUSION
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S A TRULY COSMOPOLITAN CANDLESTICK
WHAT A GOOD IDEA
IN THE MEANTIME
WITH THIS GLAZED COLOUR SCHEME
ONE DR CHRISTOPHER DRESSER
NO IT WOULD BE OUR FIRST ITEM
AND EVEN A SLICE OF CAKE ON ME
I THINK THE INK QUI
DON'T YOU AGREE
WHY DON'T WE CHECK OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT DAVE'S NAPKIN RINGS
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU
THE LEFTOVER LOLLY MOMENT
YOU GAVE YOUR MAN TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN POUND
AT THE BACK AT THIRTY FIVE
I'VE GOT TO SELL
WAS BY NO MEANS STRAIGHTFORWARD
WHICH WAS THE TWENTY FOURTH OF MAY
THE PUPILS WERE ASSEMBLED AND THE PACKAGE WAS CEREMONIOUSLY UNWRAPPED
LIVE VIA THE WIRELESS
OR THE WIRELESS
AS IT WAS CALLED
ASKING HIM WHETHER HE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DELIVERING A MESSAGE TO HIS PEOPLE
BUT HERE YOU ARE
YOU HAVE A PHYSICAL RECORD OF EVERY TIME YOU STAMMER
EVERY TIME YOU MISTAKE A WORD
I WOULD SAY IF YOU GOT HIM TO LIST HIS OWN PERSONAL QUALITIES
HE WOULD PROBABLY NOT LIST PUBLIC SPEAKING AS ONE OF HIS TOP ONES
NEW ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE BBC
IT IS EVEN SAID THAT THE DEATHBED WORDS OF GEORGE THE FIFTH WERE
HOW IS THE EMPIRE
THE BBC LAUNCHED ITS EMPIRE SERVICE
WHEN THE KING WOULD SPEAK LIVE ON THE RADIO TO HIS PEOPLE IN BRITAIN AND AROUND THE WORLD FROM HIS
BUT ALSO HAVING THIS GLOBAL ROLE WAS VERY MUCH PART OF THE FABRIC OF THE INSTITUTION
IT WAS ACTUALLY THE OFFICE OF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSEHOLD
SOME LISTENERS SWORE THEY COULD HEAR A SANDRINGHAM CLOCK TICKING IN THE BACKGROUND
WHILST THE SPECTATOR MAGAZINE
HE WASN'T TRYING TO BE A RADIO HOST
HE WAS JUST LIKE YOUR DAD BY THE FIRESIDE
FIRST CAME TO SEE A SPEECH THERAPIST IN AN ATTEMPT TO HELP HIM CONTROL A CRIPPLING STAMMER
QUITE OFTEN WE WOULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE TAKE
THE KING STEPS UP TO THE MICROPHONE
TAKES A LONG BREATH
I TURN TO HIS MAJESTY AND SAY
MAY I BE THE FIRST TO CONGRATULATE YOU
AFTER THE WAR HAD ENDED
IN DECEMBER NINETEEN FIFTY ONE
IT WAS THEN TAKEN BACK TO THE BBC AND EDITED TOGETHER FOR CHRISTMAS DAY
GIVE ME A LIGHT THAT I MAY TREAD SAFELY INTO THE
THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST
WHOSE BIRTH WE CELEBRATE TODAY
AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY
SO SHE'S INTEGRALLY LINKED TO THE COMMONWEALTH
AFTER HER CORONATION
FOR THE FIRST TIME
THIS IS A BRITISH MONARCH GOING OVERSEAS
INDEPENDENT COMMONWEALTH REMAIN TOGETHER
IT WAS GOING TO BE TELEVISED
AND JUST TO ADD TO THE PRESSURE
LIKE THE RADIO BROADCAST BEFORE
IT TOO WOULD BE LIVE
BUT OF COURSE SHE HAD TO DO IT ALL THE TIME
HAD BEGUN IN MARCH
NINE MONTHS EARLIER
THE QUEEN CHOSE TO BROADCAST FROM THIS
WHERE THE TEAM TOOK THE DESK AND EVEN THE CURTAINS FROM SANDRINGHAM TO SIMULATE CONDITIONS AND PUT
REHEARSALS CONTINUED UNTIL THE TWENTY THIRD OF DECEMBER
WHEN IT WAS DECIDED THAT TO CARRY ON WOULD ONLY ADD TO THE QUEEN'S NERVES
EVERYTHING WAS RUNNING
THE LIVE TELEVISION BROADCAST WAS DEEMED A GREAT SUCCESS ALTHOUGH ONGOING STRANGE
ONE VIEWER EVEN HEARD AN AMERICAN POLICEMAN ANNOUNCE
IN THE GREEN DRAWING ROOM AT WINDSOR
WHICH PUT A CONSIDERABLE STRAIN ON THE MONARCH
LIKE HERE AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE
AND WHEN SHE WENT AROUND I SAID TO THE CAMERAMAN
WHAT IS THE MATTER
BUCKINGHAM PALACE HAS SAID THE SUN'S ADVANCE PUBLICATION OF THE QUEEN'S CHRISTMAS MESSAGE WAS VERY
TODAY'S EDITION CONTAINS WHAT IT SAYS IS THE FULL TEXT OF THE BROADCAST
BY THEIR VERY NATURE
ON THE EIGHTH OF NOVEMBER
THERE WAS A CORRESPONDENTS' LUNCH
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ALL THAT HARD WORK
BECAUSE ICE IS GREAT FOR THE BEARS
AND WELCOME TO CELEBRITY MASTERMIND WITH ME
THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND THE REGULAR MASTERMIND IS THAT THIS LOT DON'T ONLY HAVE TO
WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY
THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO SUPPORT ME
IT'S A GREAT THING
WHO WHO WHO KIND OF MAYBE SPENT TWENTY YEARS LIKE
SO ULTIMATELY I WOULD SAY THAT VALUE OR WHAT SOMETHING'S WORTH IS ULTIMATELY WHAT SOMEBODY WILL PAY
THANKS FOR WATCHING
THERE IS NO MORE ROOM AT THE INN
WHEN THEY DON'T SLEEP
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO SOMEONE
HAS DONE FOR ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS
THE DEAD DON'T COME BACK
ALL PRESENT DAY BEAR SPECIES EVOLVED FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR
WHAT THAT ANCESTOR DID WAS MOVE OUT
EXPAND AND POPULATE DIFFERENT HABITATS ACROSS THE WORLD
THIS AREA WAS SELECTED BECAUSE THERE WAS A HIGH DENSITY AT THAT TIME
FOUR PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE A SUCCESS OF THEIR CAREERS
THE RULES ARE PRETTY MUCH UNCHANGED NINETY SECONDS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT
TWO MINUTES ON GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AWAIT THEM
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CELEBRITY TO TAKE PART IN THE REGULAR MASTERMIND
DO JOIN US AGAIN NEXT TIME FOR MORE MASTERMINDS AND THANKS FOR WATCHING
IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE HIGH STREET ELECTRICAL RETAILERS
IT'S THE BIG ONLINE PLAYERS
THE DEPARTMENT STORE
WE'RE ASKING OURSELVES
IS THAT BECAUSE WE PHYSICALLY CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE MONEY
AND THE PEAK WEEK WAS THE FEW DAYS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE CHRISTMAS
THEY DON'T SEE THE COMPLEXITY
AND THE WHOLE WALL OF LIGHTS WILL LIGHT UP
I DON'T WANT TO BE PLAYED
AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS
I THINK THAT'S IT
AND ALTHOUGH THERES STILL PLENTY OF THIS YEAR STILL TO GO
NINETY SECONDS OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT
AND THEN TWO MINUTES ON GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
LET US GET ON WITH IT
KNOW IT IS A GOOD IDEA THAT SOMEONE WHO DEDICATES FIFTEEN YEARS OF LIFE TO SOMETHING
AND IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE ON IT
AND THE CHALLENGES
IT WAS JUST A NAME I I MADE UP
BUT IT KIND OF SERVED ME WELL FOR A FEW YEARS AND WON THE MERCURY PRIZE AND THINGS LIKE THAT
USUALLY THE BUTT OF THE JOKE
UM IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO APPEAR IN THE NEXT SERIES ON BBC TWO
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT
BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY
MAY COME TO SHARE HIS LIFE IN GLORY
IN ORDER TO BE REGISTERED TOGETHER WITH MARY
WHO WAS WITH CHILD
HE TOOK BREAD AND
AND GAVE IT TO HIS DISCIPLES
BUT SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
HAVE MERCY ON US ALL
THAT WITH THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY
WITH THE BLESSED APOSTLES
FILL YOU WITH THE GIFT OF HIS PEACE AND FAVOUR AND MAKE YOU SHARERS WITH THE
LORD JESUS CHRIST
BY YOUR PRESENCE
OUR SAVIOUR AND OUR GOD
I LOVE CHRISTMAS
BUT TODAY YES CHRISTMAS DAY THE DAY JESUS WAS BORN
WHO LOVED THE WORLD SO MUCH THAT HE SENT HIS SON TO BE OUR SAVIOUR
I KNOW YOU SAID YOU HAD YOU GAVE A PRAYER
AND EVEN FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AND AND THE HOMELESS HERE IN BATH AND MANY
THERE'S A SPECIAL PARTY BEING PREPARED FOR THEM CALLED OPEN CHRISTMAS
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE WORLD
CHRISTMAS IS JUST ONE DAY
THE PROBLEMS IN OUR OWN LIVES
PERHAPS THIS IS THE FIRST CHRISTMAS WITHOUT ONE YOU LOVE OR YOU ARE ANXIOUS FOR THE HEALTH OF
AND A SIMPLE PRAYER MIGHT CHANGE OUR LIVES
IN THAT REGION THERE WERE SHEPHERDS LIVING IN THE FIELDS
AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD SHONE AROUND THEM
AND THEY WERE TERRIFIED
TO YOU IS BORN THIS DAY
IN THE CITY OF DAVID
LETS GO TO BETHLEHEM AND SEE THIS THING THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE
WHICH THE LORD HAS MADE KNOWN TO US
THEY MADE KNOWN WHAT HAD BEEN TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS CHILD
THE SHEPHERDS RETURNED
IF I SAY IT'S JUST AN ORPHANAGE
HIS PARISH PRIEST ASKED HIM
COULD HE POSSIBLY TAKE IN A FAMILY OF FOUR CHILDREN
IN ANSWER TO HIS PRAYER
RECEIVE THE BODY OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
WHICH HE GAVE FOR YOU
WHICH HE SHED FOR YOU
ALL GLORY AND HONOUR BE YOURS ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE
THIS IS MY BODY
WHICH IS GIVEN FOR YOU
AH CALLING TO MIND HIS DEATH ON THE CROSS
IN THE COMPANY OF ALL THE SAINTS
MAY PRAISE AND GLORIFY YOU FOR EVER
LET ME START BY SAYING
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T QUITE GOT OVER MY OPERATION WHICH WENT VERY WELL
I WAS A BIT WORRIED WHEN THE SURGEON STOOD OVER ME AND SAID
AND I HAVEN'T SAID THAT FOR A LONG
AS EVERYONE COMPETING TONIGHT HAS ALREADY PROVED THEMSELVES ON THE DANCE FLOOR
THE PHONE LINES WON'T BE OPEN INSTEAD
THEIR VOTES WILL BE COMBINED WITH THE JUDGES' SCORES TO DECIDE WHO WILL BE OUR STRICTLY CHRISTMAS
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE DANCING IN A HOUSE MADE OF REAL SWEETS AND IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH OF A TREAT
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING
EITHER THAT OR I SAVAGE IS BACK
QUICK QUESTION HOW MANY BRUSSELS SPROUTS DO YOU WANT
IT'S A FAST AND FURIOUS ROUTINE
WHICH IS PERFECT FOR CASSIDY
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TWO NEW BABIES IN OUR FAMILY MY BABY
EVEN IF IT'S FOR ONE DAY
I DO FEEL EMOTIONAL
IT'S THE AUDIENCE VOTES COMBINED WITH THE JUDGES' SCORES THAT DECIDE WHO WILL BE OUR STRICTLY
I'VE GOT THE GRAVY
AND EXQUISITE DANCING
I COULD I WOULD NOT BELIEVE MYSELF IF I SAID I LOVE TO DANCE
SCROOGE ISN'T HIS FULL NAME
IT'S NOW THE MOMENT WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR
I'VE BEEN VERY BUSY BABYITTING MY NEW THREE WEEK OLD GRANDDAUGHTER
MUST BE FROM YESTERDAY
I WANTED TO COME
I JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE
AND JUST CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS
AND WITHOUT HIM
I'M NOT WILD ABOUT IT
I NOW DECLARE THIS MARRIAGE
WHICH IS A SHAME
EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR POUNDS BY THE END OF THE MONTH
WE'LL TALK IT AFTER OVER
AS FAR AS THE SPARSHLY
YOU THE GREAT BRITISH PUBLIC PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS AND HELP RAISE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MONEY
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED PEPPER PIG
YOU ALWAYS SAID
WHO TEND TO LOOK A BIT GRUMPY
SINCE COMIC RELIEF STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
ALL THOSE PEOPLE CAN'T THANK YOU IN PERSON
IT'S REALLY WORKED
IN THE MEANTIME
THERE WAS ONE SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AND THAT IS THAT AND I QUOTE HERE
NAOMI HARRIS FOUND IT QUITE A CHALLENGE
EDUCATION AND CARE IS PROVIDED FOR SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE
THERE'S NOT ANYTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT NOW
LIKE IT TURNED YOUR BACK ON ME
AND HE'LL SEE YOU FOR WHAT YOU REALLY ARE
THEY'VE GONE OFF AND LEFT ME WITH BABY MATTHEW
BUT THEY KNOW THAT IT'S FAR TOO DANGEROUS TO EVEN THINK ABOUT IT
UM BEING ABLE TO ACCEPT
WE HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME
FROM NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
BECAUSE EVERYTHING HE STANDS FOR
I'LL DO MY BEST
SO EVERYBODY'S THINKING
GET US TO SET OUR BEST TIME
AND SHE COULD GET US TO KNOCK TWENTY SECONDS OFF THAT TIME
THE POINT IS WE DECIDED TO ACCEPT HIS CHALLENGE
CROSS WITH MYSELF
SOME PEOPLE THINK HE'S LIKE A TRUE BRITISH HERO
AND UTTER HUMILIATION WHICH
YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITH A CAR
WHICH YOU'VE KNOWN ABOUT FOR MONTHS
AS MUCH AS YOU'D WANT TO LEAVE HIM IN THE CAR FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
NOBODY CAN DRIVE THAT LONG
IN THE CASE OF CAR RACING
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
SEEM REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC
SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING
THEY DRAW YOU IN
WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE BONKERS ABOUT CARS AND WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CARS
THAT'S THE EXCUSE FOR WHAT THEY DO
IF THEY DIDN'T MAKE YOU LAUGH
IT WOULDN'T WORK
WHICH WAS HILARIOUS
NOT AS WELL AS IF I HAD A RISE
IF YOU DARE'T LEAVE ME IN CHARGE
MADONNA'S BEEN AFTER HIM
HE ONLY COMES HOME AT WEEKENDS
AT THIS VERY MOMENT IN TIME
WHICH BRINGS ME BACK TO YOUR MATCH
IF YOU HAD THAT MANY WOMEN
YOU WOULD NEED SOME HELP
HE STUMBLED ON THIS FORMULA WHEN HE WAS EXCAVATING A TOMB IN THE VALLEY OF THE
FRANK SINATRA USED TO DRINK THIS BY THE BUCKET LOAD
WHAT SHE NEEDS IS
IS UP THERE IN HER BEDROOM AT THIS MOMENT
IT'S MY LOVE LIFE AS WELL
IS FINE FOR FEMALES
THE GRASS IS STARTING TO RUN OUT
IT IS BASICALLY A COMPLICATED GEOLOGICAL FEATURE
THE WHOLE THING
THEY'VE BEEN IN AND EATEN ALL THAT SEED
SO NOW THEY'RE GETTING REALLY HUNGRY
WE JUST NEED TO GET LOTS OF FARMERS TO DO IT
NEED TO GROW PLANTS
GROW CROPS FOR BIRDS
I DIDN'T REALLY APPRECIATE THE DURHAM DEALS UNTIL I LEFT
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU
THE PIGS DON'T HAVE A PASSPORT
AND DEPART WITH THE FINANCIAL BACKING OF A MULTIMILLIONAIRE DRAGON INVESTOR
AND LEAVE WITH NOTHING
COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S SHOW
WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND YOU CAN SEE YOUR GREY HAIRS
THE SAFETY HAZARD DATA SHEET IS
NOBODY HAS BOTHERED TO MENTION THE FACT THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY A PRODUCT OUT THERE THAT ACTUALLY
THEY MAKE THE INNOVATIVE PRODUCT
IF YOU HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED ONLINE DATING FOR YOURSELF
YOU CAN LIKE OR DISLIKE PEOPLE ANONYMOUSLY
BUT IF YOU REALLY LIKE SOMEONE
AT THE END OF THIS EVENING
THANK YOU FOR SEEING ME TODAY
AND I JUST THINK
DELIVERED BY A FORMER MILITARY MAN WHOSE LONG ARMY CAREER HAS PROVIDED HIM WITH THE INSPIRATION FOR
MY NAME IS ROY FITTER
AND YOUR LOYALTIES BETWEEN TWO VERY
AND FOUR BRAVE SOULS WHO HAVE BOWED TO PRESSURE AND AGREED TO BE TESTED ON HOW MUCH THEY KNOW
AND THE BLACK CHAIR
BUT SO HAPPY TO COME HOME WITH A BRONZE MEDAL
THINK TO BE ABLE TO PLAY AT WEMBLEY
I THINK THAT KIND OF KICKSAR A LOT OF PEOPLE'S INTEREST IN WOMEN'S FOOTBALL
UM I THINK THE KEY TO MOST THINGS
MOSTLY THE ENGLISH
SO I WROTE HER ONE DAY AND SAID
AND HE'S BEEN MESSAGING ME
TO TAKE PART IN THE REGULAR MASTERMIND PROGRAMME
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CELEBRITY
EVERY TIME WE GO OUT
THAT'S WHAT THAT IS
THE ONLY SPECIES OF HUMAN ON THE PLANET
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK VERY FAR TO FIND WE'RE SHARING THE PLANET WITH ONE OTHER HUMAN SPECIES
THOUSAND YEARS AGO IN EVOLUTIONARY TERMS
THEY WERE AROUND UNTIL ABOUT THIRTY
MAKE NO MISTAKE
LIVING ALL OVER THE PLANET
AT THE SAME TIME AS US
FROM A CURSORY LOOK AT A FEW BONES
THREE PERCENT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH BUT THREE PERCENT IS THE AMOUNT OF DNA THAT YOU GOT FROM ONE OF YOUR GREAT GREAT
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION
BUT PROBABLY NOT
AND THE REASON BEING IS THAT WE KNOW
ABSOLUTELY YOU SAID IT ALL
WHAT YOU DO TO THE BONE THROUGH A LIFETIME CAUSES ADAPTATION
WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THESE BONES
SO FROM THIS EVIDENCE
AND TO FIND OUT HOW THEY WERE HUNTING
EARLIER THIS YEAR
I WENT TO ONE OF THE BEST NEANDERTHAL HUNTING GROUNDS IN THE WORLD
BELIEVE IT OR NOT
TWO YEARS AGO THE FIRST COMPLETE NEANDERTHAL GENOME WAS SEQUENCED
SOME DWARF BIRCH AROUND BUT
THEY NEEDED TO STAY WARMER THAN JUST THEIR PHYSIOLOGY WOULD ALLOW FOR
SOME DON'T HAVE VERY MANY
IT'S THE ABSOLUTE POSITION
THERE SEEMS TO BE NO REASON TO ASSUME THAT THEY COULDN'T
IT'S VERY CONSISTENTLY OUTWARDS
OUTWARDS IN THE BOTTOM
THAT'S NOT FROM CHEWING
THIS IS THE TEETH BEING USED AS TOOLS
CAN WE CAN WE WORK OUT IF THE NEANDERTHAL COULD SPEAK OR MAKE A NOISE
SO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THEIR WORLD THEN
WE WEREN'T ALWAYS THE ONLY HUMANS ALIVE
FIVE MILLION YEARS
TO RECREATE ONE OF THE EARLIEST HUMANS
THESE BONES WERE DATED TO FORTY NINE
THEY WERE WELL SUITED TO THEIR ICE AGE HOME AND
GIVEN THEY WERE SUCH A SUCCESSFUL SPECIES THEY SURVIVED FOR THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
I STOLE PLAY RUGBY
IF I HAVE A COLD
I GET REALLY EXCITED
NOT FOR STABBING SOMEBODY
IT WOULD SIMPLY COST YOU LOADS OF MONEY
UNLESS YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE IN EDINBURGH AND TO GO DOWN PAST ANOTHER STALL A FEW YARDS
WHICH IS A LOT FOR A SLIVER OF SILVER
WE HAVE NO IDEA
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
BUT YOU AND I KNOW THEY COULD EASILY MAKE ONE TO TWO HUNDRED
DON'T GET ME WRONG
IT'S UM IT'S QUITE A TREAT TO SEE THIS PAINTING EVERY DAY
I'M READY TO GO
HE WASN'T PAINTING FRENCH ROYALTY
YOU'RE MINUS ONE OF
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
NEVER TRAVELLED THE WORLD OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
SO I THINK THERE'S A GOOD SOCIAL ASPECT
THE ENVIRONMENT I WAS IN
MY TRAINING GROUP
TAUGHT ME A LOT YOU
YOU'LL COME ACROSS PEOPLE WHO WILL BE DOING THE CATCH PHASES AND
LARRY HAGMAN WAS THE GREAT EXAMPLE
IT STILL HAPPENS
LESS SO THAN IT USED TO
SO BECAUSE HE WAS THE OPPOSITE OF MALCOLM
THE MORE VICIOUS AND UNPLEASANT MALCOLM BECAME
ALSO BECAME A KIND OF TRAINING MANUAL FOR POLITICIANS
WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER RESIGNED
AND WHICH WE JUST MADE UP
IT WAS JUST A LINE LINE WE MADE UP AND I GOT A CALL A LITTLE WHILE LATER
WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER HAD RESIGNED
THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS LOOP WE'RE ABOUT TO ENTER
HE BECAME INCREASINGLY ANNOYING BUT ALSO
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CELEBRITY OR EVEN A TIMELORD TO TAKE PART IN THE REGULAR MASTERMIND
THANKS FOR WATCHING
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ABOUT AWARDS
IT'S NOT ABOUT AWARDS
IT'S ABOUT THE LITTLE PEOPLE
AT THE END OF THE DAY
BECAUSE I NEED TO GET HOME AND I NEED TO CHECK ON AMY AND HAD A GOOD NIGHT AND
I'VE GOT FEELINGS FOR YOU
WE'LL COME FACE TO FACE WITH ONE OF THESE EARLY ANCESTORS
WE'RE GOING TO RECREATE IN EXTRAORDINARY ANATOMICAL DETAIL ANOTHER OF OUR PREHISTORIC
AROUND UNTIL TWELVE
ALL WILL BE REVEALED LATER
THE INDIVIDUAL WE'RE INTERESTED IN TONIGHT WAS A YOUNG LAD WALKING THE EARTH ONE POINT
FIVE MILLION YEARS AGO
IF YOU HAVE A LARGE TERRITORY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHY
IN NEW YORK STATE
WHICH IS A REALLY PROFOUND CHANGE
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE SEE MODERN SAVANNAH GRASS EXTEND
WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE DOING
BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO TRY SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF FIRST
WHAT THEY DID INSTEAD WAS DO THAT VIRTUALLY
IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE
AND BUT THEY'RE REALLY EATING HIGH QUALITY FOOD
ONCE THE MUSCLES HAVE BEEN PUT ON THE SKELETON
IS THAT WE THAT ALLOWS US TO BE ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE DAY
IN A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN OTHER PREDATORS MIGHT HAVE BEEN RESTING IN THE SHADE
AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE SPACE IN BETWEEN THE PELVIS AND THE DIAPHRAGM
AND WHERE OUR GUTS LIVE
AND ESPECIALLY ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED
FIVE MILLION YEARS
WHICH IS OLDER THAN ANY OTHER SITE THAT HAS EVER BEEN FOUND
WHAT ARE YOU ABLE TO TELL ABOUT HOMO ERECTUS AND AND FIRE
WE COULD USE THAT
EVEN IF WE WEREN'T COOKING
WE COULD USE IT TO SCARE AWAY THE LEOPARDS
THAT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT SOMEONE WHO'S HAD A RICH EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTANDS WHERE THE
JOIN US BACK HERE
SOME KIND OF AL AND GOING ON HERE
AND THEN TWO MINUTES ON GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
AND AND HOW COME YOU REALISED
ALL MY FAMILY STILL WATCH IT
IT'S VERY POPULAR OUT THERE WITH THE AUDIENCE
IT'S ABOUT CHARACTERS
IT'S SORT OF LIKE A MUSIC HALL TRADITION
THE STORIES ARE PERFECT
ANYTHING ELSE THAT I READ OR WATCH
NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CELEBRITY TO TAKE PART IN THE REGULAR MASTERMIND PROGRAMME
IF YOU'D LIKE TO APPEAR IN THE NEXT SERIES OF MASTERMIND ON BBC TWO
THANKS FOR WATCHING
OSCAR WINNER EDDIE REDMAE
THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR GREAT DRIVERS
IT JUST FEELS LIKE A GOLF
THE TOTAL BILL IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT ONE
WHAT A WAY TO MAKE A LIVING YOU
HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT
I'M SAYING THIS OUT LOUD
WITH WONDERFUL LITTLE ASIDES
WHAT'S MY DAMAGE LIMITATION
WHEN I'M GOING ROUND
SO THEY SENT ME ROUND AGAIN THAT WAS NOT TIMED
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG
I THINK IF YOU ARE INTO CARS THEN THERE'S LOADS THERE FOR YOU BUT
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT INTO CARS
YOU KNOW YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT
EVEN TOP GEAR MUST HAVE HEALTH AND SAFETYED THIS
THEY'RE NOT MAKING THIS UP
HERE'S THE WORLD
YOU DON'T GET TO THE MAGNETIC NORTH POLE WITHOUT BEING AMBITIOUS
WE'RE UNWRAPPING OUR VERY OWN CHRISTMAS SPECIAL
WE COME BACK TOLYME PARK IN CHESHIRE
WHERE RECENTLY WE WELCOMED OVER TWO
THOUSAND VISITORS WHO BROUGHT ALONG THEIR FAMILY TREASURES
IT HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH BALTIC COUNTRIEST
IF YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY
OF COURSE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED MAKING AND REPAIRING THINGS ALL AROUND THE ESTATE
AND HER GIFTS WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN WE WE CAME TOLYME PARK AND ASKED THEM
WHO WAS BORN IN NINETEEN ELEVEN
THEY WERE FORCED OUT
THE PROMOTERS AND WE'VE GOT THINGS HERE LINKED TO TELEVISION
AND WE YOU THIS
AND AS A CHILD IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN
IF YOU WENT OUT WITH FIFTEEN SHILLINGS AND ELEVEN PENCE
ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR CHRISTMAS
SO THE ROADSHOW COULD BE YOUR ROAD TO RICHES
SO MAKE SURE YOU COME AND SEE US IN TWENTY SIX
BUT TONIGHT WE'VE WHITTLED THE LIST DOWN TO THE SIX MOST PLAUSIBLE CANDIDATES
HE WAS A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN
BUT TO REALLY FIND OUT WHAT THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM WAS OR WHETHER IT EXISTED AT ALL
THEY THEN SEE THE STAR AGAIN
BUT AS A HISTORICAL DOCUMENT
THE WINTER SOLSTICE
EVERYTHING GATHERED AROUND THIS DARK
THE PROBLEM IS WHERE AND WHEN TO LOOK
AND WHILE HE WAS ABOUT THIS
HE REALISED IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECALIBRATE THE ENTIRE DATING SYSTEM OF THE WORLD
OF THE THEN CHRISTIAN WORLD
WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHEN ALL THIS HAPPENED
ONE MONTH BEFORE PASSOVER
THAT THE WRITER OF THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW WAS DRAWING ON AND BUILDING UP IN TERMS OF A MEANING
AND IT WAS VERY EASY
OFTEN AFTER THE EVENT
JUST BEFORE THE FLOOD CAME
JUST BEFORE THE HARVEST FAILED
THERE WAS A COMET
THERE WAS A CONJUNCTION
AND SO I'VE COME HERE TO THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY
MANY THINGS COULD NOT BE PREDICTED LIFE
IN THOSE DAYS WITH A VERY RICH CULTURE
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE AND AND LOOK AT THE OTHER OPTIONS BUT
BUT THIS IS FASCINATING
OBSERVING IT AND WRITING IT DOWN
AS THE SUN MOVES AGAINST THE CONSTELLATIONS
BUT ON THAT DAY
THAT STAR WILL BE BRIEFLY VISIBLE JUST BEFORE THE SUN RISES
IT'LL GO OFF AS A SUPERNOVA
AT SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX LIGHT YEARS' DISTANCE
IT'S GOING TO PUT ON ONE HELL OF A SHOW IN THE NIGHT SKY
WHICH MEANS THE LUCKY STAR OF THE KING
WHICH WE KNOW AS ALPHA AQUARIRIA
NOW FROM THE ARABIC NAME
IT TRANSLATES AS THE LUCKY STAR OF THE KING
THINGS WERE NOT GREAT FOR PEOPLE
SO THEY KNEW THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF EXPECTATION AND THERE WERE WOULD BE MESSIAHS AND
QUITE A COINCIDENCE
BUT NOT A TOO AMAZING ONE
IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE SHOWERS OF SHOOTING STARS
AND THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
WHY NOBODY ELSE SAW IT WOULD VISIBLE ONLY FROM THAT PART OF THE GLOBE AND ALSO
IT'S ONE THAT HAD A RELUCTANT CHAMPION
AND A FAMILIAR FACE TO SKY AT NIGHT VIEWERS
WHICH I ADMIT IS NOT VERY CONVINCING BUT
AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE DARK SKIES OF TWO
THEY STILL DO TODAY
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS LIKE THE MOON GOING IN FRONT OF A PARTICULAR STAR
WE THINK THAT OBJECTS OF THAT SIZE HIT THE EARTH TWO OR THREE TIMES A CENTURY
BUT MOST GO UNRECORDED
BUT YOU CAN SEE
LOOK AT THOSE VIDEOS
I DON'T THINK THAT SEEING ONE OR TWO OR EVEN A WHOLE HOST OF METEORS WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED AS A MIRACULOUS SIGN AND WRITTEN INTO THE LEGENDS OF THE TIME
AND SO THAT MAKES A METEORITE STRIKE OUR FOURTH CANDIDATE TO BE THE STAR OF BETHLE
WHOSE JOB IS TO BE UP THERE NOTING DOWN EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU SEE A METEOR
ARE A GREAT LIKE CONTROL PANEL OF INDICATOR LIGHTS AND IF ONE OF THEM STARTS BLINKING
OR IF A LIGHT APPEARS WHERE IT'S UNEXPECTED
BUT LARGER OBJECTS DO HIT THE EARTH AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS
A JOURNEY THAT MUST HAVE TAKEN WEEKS
IF THERE WAS A STAFF BETHLEHEM
NOW THIS IS A BAD GOD
A BAD DIVINE BEING WHO IS BEING SENT OUT OF THE HEAVENLY REALM AND INTO THE UNDERWORLD
SO IT'S BAD NEWS FOR HIM
IN THE SAME WAY
ALL THE EVIDENCE ADDS UP AND TO YOU
BUT IT'S A QUITE RARE NATURAL EVENT
OBVIOUS CANDIDATE FOR THAT
IT DEPENDS HOW MUCH IS FALLING ONTO THE SMALL STAR
HOW QUICKLY IT'S HAPPENING
HOW BIG THE SMALL STAR IS
NO IT GETS HOTTER AND HOTTER AND HOTTER SUDDENLY
BECAUSE AS YOU SAID START
YOU CAN'T SEE THE STAR THERE
AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS
THE KING OF THE GODS
SYMBOL OF KINGS
WE'LL BE BACK IN FEBRUARY
BUT IN THE MEANTIME
YOU CAN STILL CHECK OUT THE WEBSITE TO FIND PETE'S GUIDE TO THE HIGHLIGHTS OF JANUARY'S NIGHT SKY
PROBABLY HAD LANGUAGE AND
POINT TWO MILLION YEARS AGO
HE WAS WORKING OUT IN EAST AFRICA IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE WHEN HE CAME ACROSS A FOSSILISED BONE THAT
YOU COULD PUT THOSE REMAINS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND
THERE WAS A SINGLE TOOTH
AND MY GIRLFRIEND ON THE EXPEDITION SAID
IF YOU THINK IT'S A FEMALE
SHE WAS FULLY ADULT
SIX FIVE MILLION YEARS AGO
THE BIRTH CANAL
AND NOT JUST THE MODIFICATIONS FOR LOCOMOTION BUT
BUT IT'S BECAUSE WE GIVE BIRTH TO BABIES WITH LARGE BRAINS
IN MODERN HUMANS
THIS IS ALL ABOUT BABIES FITTING THROUGH BIRTH CANALS
THERE ARE THINGS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PELVIS AS WELL
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT AFARE' CHILDREN
BUT ALL THAT CHANGED SIX YEARS AGO WHEN A DRAMATIC NEW DISCOVERY WAS ANNOUNCED
IS THE WAY THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS MOSAIC MODEL OF EVOLUTION
KIDS TAKE A LONG TIME TO LEARN FROM THEIR PARENTS
AND THAT'S WHAT THE LONG CHILDHOOD IS ABOUT
I'VE BEEN TO FIND OUT ABOUT A NEW RESEARCH PROJECT IN ITS INFANCY THAT'S LOOKING INTO JUST THAT
LOOK A BIT LIKE LAUGHING
POSSIBLY ONE OR MORE MALES
AND AND SO THAT TELLS US THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO COMMUNICATE IN ORDER TO LIVE IN IN SUCH A
AH CHIMPANZEES USE AND MAKE TOOLS TODAY
THESE MARKS NEED TO BE TREATED WITH CAUTION
WHICH MAY NOT BE SUPER NUTRITIOUS BUT
IN THE SAME REGION AS DIKIKA BABY WAS FOUND
THE BAD NEWS IS IT INVOLVES ANIMAL DUNG
I'M GOING TO PUT HUNDRED TO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PO
I THINK WE SHOULD FIX THE RESERVE OF SIX HUNDRED
ACTION RIGHT HERE
ON THE TOP OF A HILL
THE INLAY ON THE BOX
BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOING TO UP THE TEMPO
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS EXCITING
VERY BRAVE
WE'RE PUTTING OUR FIRST BATCH OF ANTIQUES TO THE TEST IN THE CELLROOM
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT
LET'S HOPE WE GET THE TOP END OF THAT ESTIMATE
NOW WHILE WE WERE IN THE AREA FILMING
PEOPLE'S LINKS TO THE PAST WOULD BE LOST FOREVER
NOW I'M HERE TODAY TO MEET THE MUSEUM'S DIRECTOR
NOT ONLY ARE THEY TAKING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESERVATION OF THESE BUILDINGS THROUGH SHEER
WHAT IS IT THEY SAY
SUCH A MEMORABLE DAY
WE FOUND SOME WONDERFUL TREASURES AS WELL
LET'S HOPE WE SEE LOTS OF ACTION
I TOLD YOU FOUR TO FIVE HUNDRED
IT'S ALL OVER FOR OUR OWNERS AND WHAT A DAY IT'S BEEN
WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU AT ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS
AND FOUR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACHIEVED A LOT OVER THE YEARS
THEY COULD BE PUTTING IT ALL AT RISK DEPENDING ON HOW THEY EQUIP THEMSELVES IN THAT BLACK CHAIR
BUT THEY ARE DOING IT ALL FOR CHARITY
FROM EVERYTHING I'VE READ
SHE WAS ONLY TRULY HAPPY WHEN SHE WAS IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE
YOU'VE GOT TO WHISPER
IN IN A FOOTBALL GROUND
YOU ARE BESIDE THE GREEN
IT WAS RIGHT TO LEFT
LET'S DISCUSS IT YOU KNOW
BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF WHAT DRAWS PEOPLE INTO THE GAME
JACK OF ALL TRADE YEAH
PEOPLE TALK IT UP AS BEING THE EPITOME OF EVERYTHING
I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
IT'S AH IT'S A DIFFERENT
I'D REALLY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO A GOOD NORTHERN IRELAND ACCENT
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO APPEAR IN THE NEXT SERIES ON BBC TWO THEN DO VISIT US ONLINE AT BBC
FLED HIS HOMELAND IN NORTH AFRICA AFTER SOLDIERS STORMED HIS SCHOOL AND ATTEMPTED TO
BUT WAS SO TERRIFIED THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN
HE DECIDED TO ESCAPE
IF THEY CAN DO IT
JESUS WAS A REFUGEE
FLEEING AS A BABY WITH HIS PARENTS
RETURNING YEARS LATER TO A STRANGE NEW HOME
HE TELLS US TO BE THOSE WHO WELCOME THE ALIEN AND STRANGER
THE POOR AND WEAK
AS A NATION WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE SO
THE HOSPITALITY OF PEOPLE HERE BRINGS LOVE
TODAY OF ALL DAYS
YOU WATCH US GET MARRIED
MICK WANTS YOU THERE
THEY BREED LIKE RABBITS
IT WAS NOT JUST THAT
FOUR CONTENDERS WHO HAVE MADE A GREAT SUCCESS OF THEIR LIVES
BUT NOW FACE A CHALLENGE THAT IS DAUNTING
IS THE CHRISTIE
YOU JUST GOT TO GET THE TONE RIGHT
I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING
I THINK BBC NEWS THEMSELVES
THE PEOPLE THAT I WEAR WITH
I THINK THAT THERE IS A MUCH MORE OF A PURE SOUND
I THINK IT MAKES THE EXPERIENCE GREATER
AND IT'S A GREAT CHALLENGE
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH I CAN'T TOUCH MY PUDDING
I NEVER THOUGHT
THANKS FOR WATCHING
IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THEY COULD PUT ME ON A TROLLEY AND WHEEL ME AWAY AND WE'D SAY GOODBYE
THEN YOU CAN GATHER THE BULBS
DESPITE THIS SUMMER RAIN SHOWER
I'M NOT SAYING THEY WERE EXPERTS BUT
MARK HOW MUCH YOU NEED AND THEY DELIVER IT ON THE BACK OF A TRUCK
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE SURROUND
IT WAS JUST A LOOSE HOLLY
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
PUT IT SOMEWHERE
RATHER THAN DESTROY THE ROOT BALL JUST TO FIT A POT THAT YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE
THEY WON'T GROW OUT AS THEY WERE BEFORE
THAT'S REALLY GOOD NEWS
ALL NURSERIES DO THIS TO TREES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SELL
WE'RE FINDING OUT HOW THE WORLD OF PLANTS AND THE WORLD OF MEDICINE SOMETIMES OVERLAP
AS WELL AS IN A TERRIBLE STATE HEALTH WISE
THIS H IS FOR HEALING PLANTS
SO THEY WOULD THEN SMOKE OPIUM
I THINK AS THE WEATHER SEEMS TO BE GETTING WARMER
THAT'S ROUND ABOUT ME
AND HYDRANIA MACROELA
THEY CAN THRIVE IN MANY
ALL THAT'S BEEN ACHIEVED
IF IT GETS INCREDIBLY COLD HERE AND WE FREEZE UP
I PUT SOME CAMERAS ROUND THE SIDES
AND WE DID GET BIRDS GOING IN AND OUT
SO I DO KNOW THEY DID LAND
AND HE GAVE ME THE EXMOOR PONIES HERE
AND WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN
MY DAD GAVE US A RARE BREED EACH TO GET US INTO RARE BREEDS CONSERVATION
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN UP FOR THE GATHER BEFORE
I'D BEEN A FALCONER FOR MANY
AND THAT WAS ALL I WANTED TO DO
NOT LEAST BECAUSE YOU WERE GRIEVING FOR YOUR FATHER
WHAT CAN YOU REMEMBER FROM THAT TIME
AND THAT WAS A MUCH GREATER DISTRACTION
THAT WAS LIKE LOSING MYSELF IN THE WILD
ALWAYS WANTING TO SEE WHAT'S THERE
IT STARTED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
AND MY DAUGHTER
THAT'S IT FROM WILTSHIRE
AND I LOOK BACK AT SOME WINTER WILDLIFE HIGHLIGHTS
THEY THINK I SWAN ROUND MAYFAIR SPENDING RICH PEOPLE'S MONEY
THE PARTY BAGS HAVE TO BE THEMED
WE LOVE THE WATCHES
THEY ALSO HOPE IT GOES UP
I BUY WATCHES THAT I LOVE
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE PRICE
IT'S ABOUT THE RESULT
THEY ARE SELLING VERY
BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN INVITATION AND THEY'RE COMING TO YOUR EVENT
I'M THINKING ABOUT
IS THE DAY I'VE FORGOTTEN WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN I FIRST STARTED DEALING IN WATCHES
WHERE THEY LIVE
YOU FIND THEM IN THE HOTEL BAR
IT'S GOT TO BE GENUINE
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
THIS IS FABULOUS
IF YOU CAN TELL ME
IF YOU BUY RIGHT
JUST SAID HOW HIS DREAM CAR IS A PHANTOM COUPE
PRETTY CLOSE TO THE WIRE
PREPARE TO BE AMAZED
AND HERE HE IS NOW
I THINK I MIGHT TAKE HIM TO MARKS AND SPENCER AND WALK HIM THROUGH LADIES' UNDERWEAR
AFTER YOU'VE COUNTED TO TEN
AND HOW DO I KNOW THEY ARE CLEAN
BECAUSE I WASHED THEM
WE'RE TRYING TO ARRANGE MAGIC'S FUTURE HAPPINESS
SURELY THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
GO AND GET ME A THERMOMETER
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION
THE BLACK DEATH
IT WIPES OUT HALF THE PLANET
I AM NORMALLY MR IMMOVABLE
HE SELLS ME MEAT
SHE'S DESPERATE TO MAKE ME SOUND UNATTRACTIVE TO OTHER WOMEN
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT
AND WHEN GASTRIC COMES BACK IN
COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S SHOW
HE'S A FORMER FINANCIER FROM THE CITY WHO'S HOPING THAT ENTREPRENEURIAL SUCCESS IS ALL IN
WE WE SUPPLY BUSINESSES
SOME PEOPLE WILL BE ON AN O TWO NETWORK AND IT WORKS
OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEUR
A FORMER FIGURE SKATER FROM RUSSIA
THEY' AH THEY'LL BE TALKING TO HUNDREDS OF OTHER PEOPLE
IT'S WHAT I WANTED TO DEFEND AS A PROPOSITION
SO THAT'S WHY I'M NOT GOING TO INVEST
AND IT LOADS UP THE BRAND'S WEBSITE
A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON THE INTERNET TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT WAYS TO SAVE
AND WHAT YOU'RE
TWO VERY DIFFERENT STORIES
HE RESCUED A YOUNG BOY AND HIS MOTHER FROM THE CLUTCHES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
THEY'RE ALL MADE DURING RENE'S LIFETIME
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU ON ABOUT
WHAT YOU DID IS THAT THESE WERE LET INTO THE BRASS RADIATOR CAP OF YOUR
THEN YOU HAVE THAT
THAT'S A FIGURINE
SO I HAD MY ARM THROUGH HIS FOR THE MORNING
AND MY SISTER SAID
TWENTY ONE WHEN HE DIED IN MAY
IT'S ALL DOCUMENTED
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WILL WOULD LOVE TO SEE THEM
I MUST ADMIT FIRST
UPHEAVAL IN THEIR LIVES
IT MAKES YOU WONDER HOW ON EARTH DID THEY MANAGE TO HOLD ON TO OBJECTS
AND THAT WOULD FIT IN
IT MADE ITS WAY
INTO THE HANDS OF A RUSSIAN BARONET
HE WENT OVER TO AMERICA
IT'S SO RARE TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS THERE TO WITNESS IT FIRST HAND
AND THE FAMILY HAVE NO INTENTION OF PUBLISHING IT
NOW IF WE EXAMINE IT
NOW I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY FAIRLY REALISTIC
FORS FOR WOMEN
THE ORIGINAL CASE
GOT NOW THE SECOND LOT IS THE ACCORDION WE
I THINK THE TIME IS RIGHT
SO THE WHOLE REGION PROSPERED
WITH THEIR SUPPORT
ACTUALLY BROUGHT TO BROUGHT HERE AND
SO WHERE DID THIS IDEA SPRING FROM
WITH THE CLOSURE OF A LOT OF THE HEAVY INDUSTRIES IN THE REGION
A LOT OF OBJECTS WERE BEING LOST
THE ORIGINAL FOUNDER OF THE MUSEUM
WE HAVE OUR OWN COSTUME DEPARTMENT
BUT THROUGH THE PEOPLE THAT CAN HELP BRING IT TO LIFE
WHAT I REALLY ADMIRE ABOUT MUSEUMS LIKE BEAMISH IS THE WAY IT BRINGS HISTORY ALIVE IN SUCH A
AND SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO THAT WAS
AND THEY HAVE PHONED EACH OTHER AGAIN
THEY WILL NOT LEAVE HERE TONIGHT ANY RICHER
THEY FEEL WARM AND FUZZY AND THEY GO AWAY HAVING LEARNED SOMETHING OR FEELING BETTER ABOUT
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A CONFLICT
BECAUSE IT'S MY OWN CHANNEL
THERE ARE BRANDS THAT THINK THAT YOU'RE LIKE TV
THAT'S NOT REALLY HOW WE WORK
YOU WANT TO TELL A STORY
THAT'S THE WHOLE THING
SLEEPING IN THE SAME ROOM AS HIM
BASICALLY ANYTHING CAN BE MADE A RECORD OF
IF YOU'RE TENACIOUS ENOUGH
YOU CAN YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE
YEAH THEY HAD TO GET THIRTY DOGS RIDING A WAVE AT THE SAME TIME
VISIT US ONLINE AT
THANKS FOR WATCHING
WE COULD GO TO OUR GRAVES CURSING THEM
SOMETHING LOW KEY
EVEN THINK ABOUT CONVERTING
MAYBE I'M GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF
YOU KEEP GOING THE WAY YOU'RE GOING AND LYING TO EVERYONE
ONE TUTORIAL WITH THE BATTLE AXE LATER
THE TERMS OF YOUR PAROLE MEAN THAT AFTER TODAY WE MEET ONLY BI MONTHLY
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A CASE WITH VAGUELY SIMILAR HALLMARKS DOESN'T MEAN SHIT
A CRITICAL ERROR
HE WILL TELL DS JONES
WELL I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A MIDWIFE TO START OFF WITH
AND OVER THE YEARS
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT HERE
AN EXPERT TO TAKE YOU ON YOUR WAY
YOU'RE PERFECTLY SOUND IN YOUR OWN RIGHT
VELLUM THAT LOOKS AS IF IT MIGHT HAVE COME FROM SOME FIFTEENTH OR SIXTEENTH CENTURY
WHEN SHE WAS TAKEN TO BITS
WILL IT TURN A PROFIT ON FIFTEEN
SO YOU FEEL IT'S A THOROUGHLY AUTHENTIC
THAT'S THE THEORY AND
SO I'M GOING TO GET MYSELF INTO PLACE BECAUSE
SOMEBODY COULD BE GOING HOME WITH A LOT OF MONEY
WHO'S IT GOING TO BE
STAY TUNED AND YOU'LL FIND OUT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NECESSARY
THEY ARE REHEARSING EVERY DAY IN TERM TIME
THEY ARE PREPARING FOR EVENSONG
BUT THE VOICE OF TOD AMERICA
BEFORE THE REFORMATION
IS THAT SOME OF THE PLACES WE VISITED ON TOUR
SINCE IT'S BEEN A CATHEDRAL PROPER
DURING RESTORATION WORK
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY
AND I WONDER IF WILLIAM EVER DID GET TOGETHER WITH SARAH
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TWO TO THREE HUNDRED A FEW YEARS AGO
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN
THIS IS AUCTION
IT IS A COLLECTIBLE
GOING UNDER THE HAMMER RIGHT NOW
THERE'S NOTHING MORE WE CAN SAY
WHEN IT GOES LIKE THAT
THIS IS THE ONE WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR
IT WAS IT WAS MINE AND DAD'S THING AND NOW IT'S NOT
NOT THAT IT'S NOT NICE TO SEE YOU
BUT SADLY WHAT IS DONE IS DONE
SHORTLY AFTER THE BIRTH
BUT I WASN'T SURE
SOME ARE LEAKING
IT'S THOUGHT THEY CAME OFF A SHIP
IT WAS ABOUT SOCIABILITY
ABOUT PEOPLE MEETING
IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT INFORMS ME OF THE ORIGINAL GLORY DAYS OF THIS FABULOUS BUILDING
I MEAN LANCQUI
I STOPPED GOING
DID DID YOU EVER GO
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE MY AGE
WE ARE BRINGING SOMETHING BACK TO LIFE
HOW ARE YOU DOING
I DON'T WANT TO PUT A NUMBER ON IT
I KNOW I SHOULD BE THINKING
IT WAS STOLEN FROM MY CASE
WHO BETRAYED ME
I WAS IN THERE FIFTEEN HOURS
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME PA
I NEED TO BE WITH MY SON
IT'S YOUR HUSBAND
THIS PLACE SCORES HIGHLY ON THE GREEN CREDENTIALS FRONT
I THINK WE NEED TO PUT AN ESTIMATE AT
AND AND I THINK WILL DO WELL
IT'S A FANTASTIC PLACE
HE BUILT IT HIMSELF
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS COASTLINE
GRAHAM LENT OVER THE ROCKS
A LONG WAY DOWN
SALT WAS INCREDIBLY
THERE WAS SOMETHING SO COMPELLING ABOUT THE STORY THAT CAPTURED THE READER'S IMAGINATION
WHEN LAURIE LEE WAS JUST THREE YEARS OLD
LAURIE SPENT MANY A HAPPY TIME HERE AND HE IS WELL REMEMBERED BY BARBARA HOOPER
WHO SHARES LOTS OF MEMORIES WITH HIM
BUT IT WAS MADE IN STAFFIA QUITE A LONG TIME AGO
IT IS TOTALLY BANNED
IF YOU'VE GOT ANY ANTIQUES YOU WANT TO SELL
WE WANT TO SEE THEM
CHECK DETAILS IN THE PRESS
WE'VE RUN OUT OF TIME
SEE YOU NEXT TIME
MY FAMILY KEPT HIM A SECRET FROM ME
BAD THINGS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME AND
COME CAN WE DO IT NOW
BRIAN TOLD ME ABOUT THIS OTHER WOMAN UP NORTH
TAKE A STEP BACK
DON'T GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY WITH THE TRUTH
WITH THE FAMILY
LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT RIGHT NOW
WE WANTED TO SEE BABY ARTHUR BEFORE WE LEFT
HIS SISTER AND HIS SISTER IN LAW
AND THE MARVELLOUS THING IS
BUT HIS REAL PASSION WAS WRITING
WITH A MUCH MORE POPULAR NOVEL AND THE ONE WHICH REALLY BROUGHT HIM PUBLIC ACCLAIM UNDER THE
WHICH WAS A CHURCH BAND AND IT WAS VERY MUCH A FAMILY TRADITION FOR HIM TO DO THAT
GRANDFATHER AND UNCLE ALL PLAYED IN THE STRING BAND
LATER HE WAS DESCRIBED BY ANOTHER POET
HE OBVIOUSLY HAD
HISTORY TELLS US IT WAS AWFUL
I COULD BE FINE AND THIS
SHARES PLUNGED AFTER CHINA SUSPENDED TRADING ON ITS MARKETS FOR THE SECOND TIME THIS WEEK
IN THIS CASE A FLOWER
THESE KILLER WHALES KNOW THAT BY PRODUCING THAT FREQUENCY OF SOUND AT THAT VOLUME
THE SHARK HAS TO DISAPPEAR WHEN IT'S VIEWED FROM THE SIDE
AND THIS IS WHERE IT GETS REALLY CLEVER
THEY'VE GOT TO SEEK THAT PREY OUT
THERE IS NOWHERE TO HIDE
SO HOW CAN A CREATURE AS LARGE AS A GREAT WHITE SHARK CONCEAL ITSELF WHILST
AS ANIMALS ARE PREPARING FOR THE WINTER
PROTEIN ALL IN ALL
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM
THIS PARK IS A HOTBED OF THEFT AND DECEPTION
BUT HERE IS THE REALLY INTERESTING THING
THEY'RE NOT FOOLING ANOTHER SPECIES THEY'RE TRICKING ONE ANOTHER
THIS IS A CASE OF DECEPTION AND THEN COUNTER DECEPTION EVOLVING AT THE SAME
CHEAT AND STEAL FROM ONE ANOTHER TO GET THEMSELVES A DECENT MEAL
THERE ARE PLENTY OF MONKEYS ABOUT
BUT TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE GETTING UP TO
IF ANYTHING IS GOING TO GET MY PHONE BACK
BECAUSE IF THEY WANT THEIR CON TO WORK IN THE LONG TERM
TO ENSURE THAT THE VICTIM IS BLISSFULLY UNAWARE THAT IT'S EVER BEING HAD
VERY DIFFICULT TO DO
SO IT'S TURNED TO A LIFE OF CRIME
YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT
IS REMARKABLE AND SURELY MAKES THIS ONE OF THE MOST DEVIOUS ANIMALS ON OUR
WE SHOULD ALL BE TOGETHER
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE
BUT I NEEDED TO PROTECT ARTHUR
WE KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IF YOU CAN LEAD ME
YOU CAN LEAD ANYBODY
WITHOUT A SHADOW OF DOUBT
IN A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION
YOU'RE IN THE ROOM
THEY ARE MOVING VERY WELL
SO IT'S TO TAKE PEOPLE INTO ANOTHER WORLD
CALLED THE WILD WILD WEST
THEY GET TWO MINUTES OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT
AH FOUR CONTENDERS ARE ABOUT TO SIT IN THE BLACK CHAIR
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT ALL THE SCORES
THANKS FOR WATCHING
THE USUAL RULES APPLY A MINUTE AND A HALF ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND TWO MINUTES ON GENERAL
IT'S ACTUALLY EMPOWERING TO GO AND DO SOMETHING
IF YOU WANT ME TO AUDITION FOR THIS FILM
I CAN JUST IMAGINE IT NOW
THE CONTENT OF THAT WAS INCREDIBLY ENLIVENING AND CONFIDENCE GIVING AND HE JUST HAD A
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT
ONLY WHEN I LOSE MONEY
IF YOU'D LIKE TO APPEAR IN THE NEXT SERIES ON BBC TWO
DO JOIN US AGAIN NEXT TIME FOR MORE MASTERMINDS
THANKS FOR WATCHING
I'M JUST LOOKING FOR MY PATIENT
WE WERE REALLY STRETCHED THAT DAY
ARE GOING TO THE BALL
THIS IS HEARTWOOD FOREST
AS TOM HAS BEEN FINDING OUT
THE ONE I'M WAITING FOR
THE BUS MIGHT NOT COME AT ALL
WORK WHAT ABOUT YOUR SOCIAL LIFE
WHEN YOU'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO SPEND
OVER THE PAST DECADE
THEN IT'S PLACES LIKE THIS THAT ARE GOING TO BE HIT REALLY HARD
SOME PEOPLE RISK BEING CUT OFF FROM JOBS
EVEN YOUNG ONES
ARE INCREDIBLE HABITATS AND
LAST YEAR WE ASKED YOU TO TELL US ABOUT YOUR FARMING HEROES FOR A BRAND NEW COUNTRYFILE AWARD
THE RESPONSE WAS INCREDIBLE AND IT WAS A TOUGH ASK FOR ADAM AND HIS FELLOW JUDGES TO PICK A WINNER
WE ARE GOING TO BE LAUNCHING FARMING HERO TWENTY SIXTEEN
AND THIS YEAR WE ARE LAUNCHING THE AWARDS AGAIN
SO WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT THOSE SPECIAL PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE WHO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND
THANK YOU SO MUCH
HE COULD BE A COMFORT IN YOUR LIFE
I WANT YOU TO BLOW IN THAT
THAT'S WHERE THE DEEPEST LOVE LIES
IN THREE FLAVORS
JUST AROUND THE CORNER
WOULD YOU BELIEVE
AND NOBODY SAID A WORD
AND AS SOON AS YOU HAVE
THEY WERE SKILLED IN THE ARTS OF LOVE WHEN WE WERE STILL PAINTING BY NUMBERS
THANK YOU FOR ASKING
IF MR NEWBOLD COMES IN HERE ON HIS OWN
I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BACK OUT ENTIRELY WHEN SHE KNEW HER DATE WAS GASTRIC
TELL ME IT'S READY
THE QUESTION IS
DO WE FEED GASTRIC BEFORE WE GO
WAITING IN THE WINGS ARE ENTREPRENEURS DESPERATE TO SECURE SOME CASH
BUT THE RULE IS
THEY MUST GET AN OFFER OF ALL THE MONEY THEY'VE ASKED FOR OR THEY LEAVE WITH NOTHING
WE'LL SEE WHETHER ITS KEY INGREDIENT WILL GIVE THE DRAGONS A KICK
AND POTENTIALLY YOU COULD BE A LITTLE BIT ALL OVER THE PLACE IN LIFE AS WELL
YOU'VE GOT TWO PREMISES
THAT TAKES THREE MINUTES
WHEN I SEE BAGS OF APPLES
IN YOUR FIRST YEAR
I DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE THE SIZE THAT YOU THINK IT IS
THANKS FOR LISTENING
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE
FIFTY FOR THIS CYLINDER
THAT'S THE SLIGHTLY MORE ROMANTIC SIDE OF IT
BUT I'M VERY SORRY
LIKE SPENCER WITH HIS UNIQUE GAS STOVE
WHICH CREATED A BIDDING WAR IN THE DEN
THE MAJORITY OF THE HOUSE IS DEDICATED TO A MUSEUM AND GALLERY
WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT DEVIZES SCHOOL
HE BOUGHT IT WITH MY LATE MOTHER
BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU TOOK IT OUT AND USED IT YOU WOULD REMEMBER THAT PARTICULAR PERSON
SO IT WAS A CODE
BUT I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THEM
AND FROM ALICE IN WONDERLAND
HE WAS THE REAL ROBINSON CRUSOE
I'VE JUST SPOTTED SOMETHING FANTASTIC
SYON PARK AND OSTERLEY PARK
BOTH IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AND IN THE CAPITAL
I THINK JOHN WAS SORT OF OUT HUNTING MOST OF THE TIME
AND IT WAS HIS WIFE
THE DOOR PANEL ITSELF
SINCE CALLED THE SHAKESPEARE OF ENGLISH CABINET MAKERS
TWO STAFFORDSHIRE DOGS
AND FIFTY POUNDS FOR THAT ONE
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE SHOW
WAIT A COUPLE OF DAYS
YOU'VE BEEN MONITORING MY PHONE SINCE SHE LEFT
YOU ALSO LIKE TO FOLLOW HIM
WE'VE GOT A HUGE CROWD HERE
THEIR JOB IS TO PICK OUT THE BEST ITEMS TO TAKE OFF TO AUCTION LATER ON IN THE SHOW
I'VE GOT TO BRING SOMETHING
I'D LIKE TO SAY
BACK INTO THE CAR PARK
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME FOR OUR FIRST VISIT TO THE AUCTION ROOM
WE'VE FOUND SOME FANTASTIC ITEMS
IT'S TIME TO PUT THOSE VALUATIONS TO THE TEST
SO WHILE WE MAKE OUR WAY OVER THERE
HE TESTED IT FOR GOLD
BUT DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
A COMBINATION OF HEAVY TAXES AND MORE ECONOMICAL METHODS OF PRODUCTION MEANT THAT THE ESSEX SALT
MONITORING THE WATER
BUT IT COULD BE A HARM ONE
I THINK IT COULD MAKE A HUNDRED
AND ALSO EVEN MORE UNUSUAL IS THIS LOVELY LITTLE BIT OF SPRIG DECORATION
AND I THINK IT'S GOT CHARM
WHO'S JOINED US NOW
AND I'M SELLING AT FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY
I DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT STACEY
I WAS REALLY WRONG TO DO WHAT I DID
NOW CHILD KILLER ROBERT BLACK HAS DIED IN PRISON IN NORTHERN IRELAND
IT WAS FROM NATURAL CAUSES
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE PLUMMETING PRICE OF OIL
SERVICES IN SOUTH EAST LONDON WERE DELAYED TODAY BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE OF THE SUN
MINISTERS SAY THE STRIKE IS UNNECESSARY
KILLING AT LEAST EIGHT GERMAN TOURISTS AS WELL
ALWAYS A JOY TO TALK TO
AND THAT CAUSES AN INCREASED PRESSURE IN THE HEAD
HIS SCHEDULE HAS BEEN CHANGED
SO HE IS NOT ALLOWED TO STAY UP PAST EIGHT O'CLOCK
AND THEY DO USE GREENWICH MEAN TIME ON THE ISS
GO AND WE ASKED HIM WHAT HE BEEN DOING
SPACEWALK IS TO ACTUALLY FIX A BOX WHICH TRANSFERS ALL THE POWER FROM ONE OF THE SOLAR
WHERE I CAN HAVE A LOOK AROUND
THE PREPARATION AND THE AND THE TRAINING IS ALL DONE BACK IN HOUSTON IN THE NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LABORATORY
THE WHOLE SIX AND A HALF HOURS WE HAVE PLANNED IN METICULOUS DETAIL
MYSELF AND TIM COPRA HAVE RUN THROUGH THE PROCEDURES
AND SO WE ARE REALLY READY TO GO
CONNECTING ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS
NOW IN ADDITION TO THIS
I GOT ANOTHER BAG WITH THREE MORE ELECTRICAL COILS AT LEAST AS BIG AS THIS
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WORKING WITH THIS KIND OF THING IN WEIGHTLESSNESS IS FRAUGHT WITH PERIL
NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF
ITS SOMETHING THAT I' AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT DOING
WE' IN A VERY WET CHESHIRE
YOU HAVE TO DO IT SOMETIMES
YOU CAN JUST SEE HOW STABLE IT BECOMES
IT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE ITS PLANE
WHEN WELL PROFESSOR LUCY GREEN IS HERE TO SHOW US THE WAY
IT IS GOING TO REMAIN IN THE SAME PLANE
I CAN PUT IT PHYSICALLY INTO A DIFFERENT PLANE
AND ITS MUCH MORE STABLE
SO IT JUST GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW WE USE SPIN STABILISATION AND GYRO STABILISATION FOR
WHAT CAN WE HOPE TO SEE IF WE GET LUCKY
THE ISS IS NOTHING WITHOUT THE ASTRONAUTS ON BOARD
HE EMBARKED ON ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS OF THE TRAINING IT TAKES TO MAKE IT UP THERE
BUT WHEN THE WEATHER CLEARS
NOW IS A GREAT TIME TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR THE PLANET MARS
WE ARE ALL ABOUT THE PLANETS AT THE MOMENT
AND IF YOU ARE OUT BEFORE DAWN
ALL FIVE PLANETS THAT ARE VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE WILL BE LINED UP ALONG THE HORIZON
A REMARKABLE SPINNING NEUTRON STAR
WEEK WERE GOING TO BE FINDING OUT WHAT IT TAKES TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT
LIZ BONIN WILL BE JOINING US LIVE FROM EUROPE'S ASTRONAUT TRAINING CENTRE
INCLUDING TIM PEAKE
HAVE TO GO THROUGH
BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE WE GOING TO SPEAK TO TIM DIRECTLY FROM THE SPACE STATION
SO JUST ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TO GO RIGHT
AND WELCOME ON BOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION
COME BACK TO US SOON THOUGH FOR HIS FIRST ASTRONAUT TRAINING SESSION
THE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING ONE FOR MISSIONS ACROSS OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
THE IS BUT I WAS LOOKING UP OTHER CRITERIA THAT YOU MIGHT NEED SHOULD YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS FURTHER AND SOME
ESPECIALLY WORKING WITH YOUR SAFETY TETHERS
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A LOT OF FOCUS ON SAFETY
A SCIENTIFIC OR TECHNICAL QUALIFICATION AS WELL
YOU GOT TO HAVE THE RIGHT PERSONALITY
HOW YOU CAN SEE IT FOR YOURSELF
I REMAIN OPTIMISTIC
BUT HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT YOUR CHANCES ARE OF SPOTTING THE SPACE STATION AND OTHER OBJECTS IS THE
SO TONIGHT MAKE THE MOST OF IT AS IT CLEARS
TOMORROW NIGHT LITTLE CHANCE
WELL THESE ARE RADIO PHENOMENA
BUT PUSH PHYSICS TO ITS LIMITS
LET'S REJOIN TIM PEAK NOW ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION
WHEN WE CHAT E
THE ONLY DIFFICULT PERIOD IN ADAPTING AND EVEN THEN
AND IT WASN'T TOO BAD
BUT AFTER THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR HOURS
A NORMAL REGIME ON THE BIKE MACHINE
A RESOUNDING YES
IT HAS FAR EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS
THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE
UM AND I THINK REALLY
THE TRAINING CAN PREPARE YOU FOR ALL OF THE PRACTICAL ELEMENTS
UM ALL OF THESE KINDS OF EXPERIENCES AND THEN FIRST THAT FIRST VIEW OF PLANET EARTH FROM SPACE
AND THAT WAS ANOTHER EXCITING MOMENT BUT
BUT SEEING HOW LARGE THE SPACE STATION LOOKED OUTSIDE MY SAWYERS WINDOW AS WE
YOU SEE THE CITY LIGHTS
YOU SEE THE THUNDERSTORMS AND YOU REALISE JUST THE SCALE OF THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE PLANET AND
YOU SEE THE STARS AND IT'S AND IT IS INCREDIBLE
I ALMOST FOUND IT HARD TO PICK OUT FAMILIAR CONSTELLATIONS BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY STARS AND
SO MUCH BRIGHTER UP HERE ON THE SPACE STATION THAN FROM PLANET EARTH
EARLIER ON WE SPOKE TO TIM PEAKE
SO WE CAN'T SAY WE SIZE IT FOR ANYBODY IN PARTICULAR
WE JUST BUILD PARTS
GREAT TALKING TO YOU
SEE IF JOHN BISHOP HAS COMPLETED HIS TASK
HOW IS HE DOING
WONDERING ABOUT THE UNIVERSE AND OUR PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE AND OBVIOUSLY I'M SURE EVERYBODY WHO
FANTASTICALLY COMPLICATED PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITELY NOT DESIGNED FOR COMFORT
TO DO WITH THE WHAT THE PARTICLES THAT MAKE UP THE ATMOSPHERE
MAINLY HYDROCARBONS ON THE EARTH
THEY GO OUT THE DOOR
THAT'S ALWAYS THE MANTRA OF MISSION CONTROL
AND FORCE IS THE CHANGE IN MOMENTUM
THE RATE OF CHANGE
YOU'D THINK THAT PERHAPS OUT THERE IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE
THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME SIZE
HAD A SPINNING PART TO IT WHICH ALLOWED THE ASTRONAUTS TO HAVE A FEELING OF GRAVITY ON THE WAY THERE
SO IF WE CAN GET SOME SORT OF ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY GOING
NOT JUST TO GET THROUGH THE DATA BUT HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE LOOK AT EACH PARTICULAR OBSERVATION
THESE BEING MORE COMMON MAYBE THAN OUR NORMAL KIND OF PLANET
IT MUST BE THAT TIME OF DAY AGAIN
FIVE MORE MINUTES
IN A SMART GEORGIAN DINING ROOM
IT'S GOING TO BE WORTH
IF YOU KNEW ITS PURPOSE
THEY'RE NOT AN UNUSUAL THING TO SEE
HOW ARE YOU DOING
LOOK AFTER YOURSELVES
IT'S WORTH ANYTHING FROM BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND FORTY
SEE WHAT HAPPENS YEAH
AND THEY THEY PRINCIPALLY USED IT IN VENICE
THAT'S MINUS TEN
AND THEY GAVE IT TO HER
LAR GETS ALL THE ATTENTION
SO DID YOU BUY IT BECAUSE OF THE DECORATION
CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT ITEMS ARE COMING WITH US
SO IT'S VERY INTERESTING
ITALIAN AND LATIN
THINGS LIKE THAT
OVER THE NEXT TWO HUNDRED YEARS
IT CAME FROM A GERMAN MONASTERY AND TOOK
AFTER SIX CENTURIES OF BEING INHABITED WITH QUEENS
DUKES AND MONKS
THE FUTURE OF ASHRIDGE WAS THROWN INTO COMPLETE JEOPARDY
YOU HAVE THESE VERY CLEAN LINES
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE MODERN
IT'S WORTH GOING FOR
YOU KNOW I CAN'T AFFORD A THOUSAND
TRUE WELL I SHALL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING SALE
IF YOU ARE THINKING OF BUYING SOMETHING AT AUCTION
NOT QUITE YOUR MONEY BACK BUT
SEE YOU NEXT TIME FOR PLENTY MORE SURPRISES
YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE ROBINS TO WANT THAT
CAN YOU SEE MAYBE SEVEN
AT THE END OF ITS MISSION
BECAUSE IT'S VERY
YOU KNOW THE ONLY THINGS THAT WE DO THAT MIGHT REACH OUT TO THE STARS IN A WAY THAT THEY COULD FIND WOULD BE
BY THAT I MEAN TELEVISION
SO THEY WON'T SEE ANYTHING
SO THEY CAN THEN COMPARE HOW THEY WORK IN SPACE
WE'VE UNCOVERED THINGS THAT WE WERE EXPECTING THINGS THAT WE WEREN'T EXPECTING
AGO IT WAS EVEN CLOSER
WE WILL END IN SEPTEMBER
MEANING LITTLE GREEN MAN ONE
THE OXYGEN SYSTEM DECREASES GRADUALLY
BUT THE EFFECTS ARE QUITE EXTREME
PLEASE DON'T BE ALARMED THOUGH
THOUGH HE WAS IN GOOD HANDS THROUGHOUT
SO WE REMAIN HOPEFUL
I STILL LOVE THE VIEW
EVEN THOUGH IT'S CLOUDY THERE IS STILL SOME HOPE THAT IT'LL ACTUALLY BRIGHTEN UP AND MAYBE YOULL BE ABLE TO SEE SOME
MUCH BETTER CHANCES OVERALL AS WE GO THROUGH TOMORROW NIGHT
LIZ BONIN IS PUTTING JOHN THROUGH THIS PROCEDURE
TALK TO YOUR FANS
WHENEVER THEY THEY WENT TO SOME PLACE
SO THE IDEA IS TO GO TO THE MOON AND TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE MATERIAL WHICH WE HAVE OVER THERE
SO EVEN DURING THE UKRAINE CRISIS
JOHN BISHOP ENDURED HAVING HIS BRAIN DEPRIVED OF OXYGEN AS PART OF HIS ASTRONAUT TRAINING
I STILL CAN'T QUITE FAT THEM HOW YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO TO GET YOURSELF OUT OF THAT SITUATION PROPERLY
WHATS GOING ON
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
YOU ARE A BRAVE MAN
JOIN US TOMORROW FOR MORE SPACE EXPLORATION TRAINING FROM THE MAN
NASA SAYS IT IS HOPING TO GET PEOPLE TO MARS BY THE TWENTY THIRTY S AND PLANS BY THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY
WE CAN LOOK FOR WATER
FOR SEVERAL REASONS
IF YOU GO TO MARS
SO YOU CAN HAVE EVEN SKYPE TO THE MOON
SHE SET HIM OFF ON A MAJOR REBUILDING PROJECT
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH CATHERINE GOT VERY SERIOUS
HE WAS CAUGHT NAPPING
OPENING UP THE SKIN
YOU ARE INFECTING THE PATIENT WITH SMALLPOX
MAKES IT VERY RISKY
THEY THOUGHT THAT
SOONER OR LATER
WHEN IT WAS READ BY HER ADVISERS
WAS JUST THOUGHT FAR TOO REVOLUTIONARY
GENUINELY SURPRISED THAT EVEN SOME OF HER CLOSEST FRIENDS
SOME OF THE MOST ENLIGHTENED PEOPLE IN THE EMPIRE
WERE SO RELUCTANT TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT SERFDOM
THAT SO MUCH OF IT WAS OUT OF HER CONTROL
AND IT'S THIS GREAT DESIRE TO EDUCATE
TO IMPROVE EDUCATION
ALONG WITH THE REST OF HIS TWO HUNDRED
IN THE AUDIENCE OVER THERE
AS A POWERFUL WOMAN
NOT NECESSARILY SEXUAL SENSE
WHEN THEY WERE COMPLETE
HE WASN'T GOING TO COME TO RUSSIA
CAPABILITY BROWN SAID
ONE IS THAT ANY SUGGESTION OF DOING THAT COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO SOME SORT OF
EVEN A COUP AGAINST HERSELF
SHE WAS VERY SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT MONARCHS COULD BE REPLACED BY THIS METHOD
THAT WAS ONE DANGER
THE OTHER ONE WAS
AND ALEXANDER DIDN'T SHOW ANY WILLINGNESS WHATSOEVER
AS FAR AS ONE CAN TELL
A FEW MOMENTS LATER
BUT ALEXANDER WAS AN EMPEROR WHO FANCIED HIMSELF AS A MILITARY MAN
HE'D TAKEN COMMAND OF THE ARMY HIMSELF
IN ECONOMIC TERMS
BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT
IT WAS QUITE INTOLERABLE FOR ALEXANDER AND FOR RUSSIA FOR NAPOLEON TO CONTROL POLAND
ALEXANDER REALISED THAT THIS HAD BEEN HIS OWN FAULT
NAPOLEON WAS NOW FACING AN ALEXANDER WHO WAS OLDER AND WISER
IT WAS MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE PAINTER TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF CAVALRY IN ATTACK
CATHERINE THE GREAT
BUT WE MET AGAIN AT EIGHTEEN WHEN HE RANG ME BECAUSE HE HAD A TELEPHONE CALL FROM THE
CAN BE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
BUT WITH FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES GONE
A STARTING PRICE
WELL I'M NOT COMPLETELY DECIDED
THE ORIGIN OF THE SPECIES AND ALL THAT
IS THAT SPECIAL
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
BUT JUST IN CASE IT GOES
AH YOU DECIDE LATER
WE WERE PLANNING A BIT MORE
I'M I'M TRYING TO MAKE THIS EASY FOR YOU
AND I SWEAR IT WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO MY FEELINGS
I TOOK HIM ON AS WELL
THAT'S ALL SHE SAID TO ME
MORE BOMB AND GUN ATTACKS FOLLOWED IN JAKARTA
IT'S AFTER A DAMNING NEW REPORT FROM THE WORLD ANTIDOPING AGENCY
IT SAID CORRUPTION WAS EMBEDDED IN THE BODY HE NOW HEADS
LEADS THE RACE FOR THIS YEAR'S OSCARS
MAD MAX FURY ROAD IS JUST BEHIND WITH TEN
FOUR OTHERS HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY ALSO STOLE GEMS WORTH FOURTEEN MILLION POUNDS
TWO TRIBUTES TO ALAN RICKMAN WHO'S DIED AGED SIXTY NINE
THE NEXT TWO MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE
BECAUSE IF YOU GIVE THEM TO ME
LET ME ASK YOU FOR SOMETHING
EVEN STEAL FROM ONE ANOTHER JUST TO GET AN ADVANTAGE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DECEPTION HERE
WHEN IT COMES TO MATING
AND WE CALL IT THE GESSO
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING
THEN THIS TRICK MIGHT JUST WORK
A BURDEN ON THEIR ABILITY TO FIND FOOD FOR THEMSELVES AND SUCCESSFULLY REAR THOSE YOUNG
THERE'S ALWAYS AN UNDERLYING CONFLICT BETWEEN PARENTS AND THEIR OFFSPRING
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU I'VE BEEN STAGGERED AT THE LENGTHS THEY'LL GO TO TO TRANSFORM THEIR APPEARANCE
OR THEIR BEHAVIOUR
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT
WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE THING THAT YOU' FOUND
AND IF YOU WANT TO GET A BEHIND THE SCENES LOOK
WILL IT END UP SHINING FOREVER
THIS WAS THE ONE YOU WERE DREADING THE MOST
YOUVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW YOU ARE NOT FALLING INTO SOME SILLY TRAP AND SHOUTING WITH ENTHUSIASM ABOUT
BUT SO WHAT IS THE INTEREST TODAY
THEY ARE ALSO VERY USEFUL CLOCKS
WE CAN USE TO LOOK OUT FOR GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION
THEYRE GOING TO USE THESE THINGS LIKE NAVIGATION BEACONS
EVER SINCE THEN
AND FINDING OUT HOW THAT IS AFFECTING HIS BODY IS A CENTRAL PART OF THE RESEARCH HE
RESEARCH HERE ON THE GROUND AIMS TO MAKE SPACE TRAVEL MUCH LESS ARDUOUS ON THE HUMAN BODY
BUT THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW AND WHY IT PUNISHES US
AND THEN TRY TO STOP IT HAPPENING
NOW THE MESSAGE ON MY PHONE SAYS
DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE PLANETS
EXERCISE AS YOU WERE SPINNING AROUND
MUCH LIKE IF I HAVE A TUNING FORK
WHAT KIND OF GEE
WEVE LOOKED AT THREE MILLION SEPARATE OBSERVATIONS ACROSS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
GOOD NIGHT FROM US
THE DEAD REMNANTS OF A PARTNER STAR
SO EITHER WILL BE A WHITE DWARF
WHERE ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THAT MANY PEOPLE LISTENING TO YOUR LATEST SONGS
ALL THE BIRDS WERE OFF SEEING CLIFF RICHARD
VAN MORRISON WAS THE WORST
WHAT WE DIDN'T WANT WAS A REPEAT OF WHAT HAPPENED AT ALTAMONT WITH THE HELLS ANGELS
REALLY PUT ME OFF
IT'S A LONG TIME AGO
PAT AND TONY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE
WE APPROACH BRIAN'S MANAGER
WHO DECLINED THE OFFER
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS
UM GOT STUCK ON ONE OF YOUR TRAINS WHICH PI OF GROUND HALT ON THE WAY TO THE V
WELLOP FRIDGE
DON'T WOUND ME WITH YOUR DESPERATE LIES
I AM NOT GOING TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU
A ROUND OF DRINKS IS TWICE AS EXPENSIVE
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT EMOTIONS
SO THAT WOULD BE
WHO WAS THE STAR PLAYER BACK THEN
FOUR MORE CONTENDERS ARE ALL SET TO TAKE TO THE STAGE TONIGHT
ONE OF OUR FOUR WILL GO THROUGH TO THE NEXT ROUND
PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
IT'S BYE BYE TIME
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP THINKING ABOUT HIM
TODAY WAS THE NEXT MOST DANGEROUS THING THAT AN ASTRONAUT DOES
SIX AND A HALF HOURS WE WERE SCHEDULED FOR TODAY SO WEVE BEEN HERE ALL DAY WITH CHRIS HADFIELD
WATCHING THE SPACEWALK EVERY STEP OF THE WAY
EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO PLAN
SO IT WOULD BE UNNERVING FOR THE FLIGHT SURGEON
YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN KNOW IT WAS THERE
WE NEED TO GO AND FIX IT
THE SPACE STATION IS FINE AT THE MOMENT
THE SEQUENTIAL SH UNIT IS A BIT LIKE THE ON OFF SWITCH
OUR POWER COMES FROM THE SUN
SO THE ASTRONAUTS HAD TO WAIT UNTIL WE WERE IN THE DARKNESS UNTIL THE SUN HAD SET FOR THEM TO GO AND TOUCH THAT BOX
TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE IT AND REPLACE IT
IS MY BEST GUESS SO
SORT OF WITH ALMOST NO WARNING
TIM PEAKE NOT ONLY HAS TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING OUTSIDE
GET HIS HELMET OFF
YOUR MOM WITH YOU
EVERYTHING IS WORKING WELL
HE GETS THE RIGHT NUMBER
WE ARE RUNNING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AT A TIME RIGHT NOW
THE CREW WERE NEVER IN DANGER
BUT JUST AS A SPECIES
EVERYBODY HAS DONE THEIR JOBS PERFECTLY
WE KNOW HOW SERIOUS THAT CAN BE
AND WE DEALT WITH A SERIOUS PROBLEM
BUT I MEAN ITS TAKEN US TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO ACTUALLY SEE WHAT HE DOES
I MUST ADMIT I WAS QUITE RELIEVED WHEN UM WHEN YOU KNEW THAT THAT WAS IT AND THEY WERE ALMOST BACK TO SAFETY AND JUST
WE KEEP USING THIS WORD SURREAL
USUALLY WE TRY TO BUT
IF HE GETS THE CHANCE
WRITERS AND COMPOSERS FOR THE LAST FEW CENTURIES
FOR ONE DAY ONLY
AND WE'LL BE FLOGGING THE BEST AT AUCTION LATER ON IN THE SHOW
RIGHT NOW IT IS NINE THIRTY
THIS PILE HERE
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WE
SOME ITEMS COULD FLY AWAY
WE HAVE BEEN CALLING IT A BRONZE VESTA CASE BUT
I AGREE WITH THAT
WHICH IS YOU KNOW A FEW MILE AWAY
WAS IT ALL HANDS AT THE PUMP
AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT THINGS WEREN'T MAINTAINED
BUT IT SURVIVED ALL OF THAT
THE HOUSE AND THE GROUNDS WERE DESIGNATED AN ANCIENT MONUMENT
WHEN YOU'RE BROWSING AROUND AN AUCTION ROOM
ALWAYS BUY A CATALOGUE
READ WHAT IT SAYS IN THE DESCRIPTION
AH ONE COUPLE REMAIN IN THE HUNT FOR TEN
FLOSSIE'S HOME ALONE
YOUR CHANCES OF SURVIVING THE OPERATION ARE VERY SLIM
WHAT DO WE DO NOW
NOW DON'T LET ME DOWN
THANKFULLY FOR PARENTS LIKE SARAH
THE RIDING FOR THE DISABLED ASSOCIATION IS THERE TO OFFER HOPE
ANYONE WITH A PHYSICAL OR LEARNING DISABILITY
HOWEVER YOUNG OR OLD
PLEASE GIVE WHAT YOU CAN
AND TO GET THE SEARCH FOR COUNTRYFILE'S TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN FARMING HERO UNDERWAY
WITH THE HELP OF THIS SONIC HAMMER
SOME OF THEM ARE OBVIOUSLY INCREDIBLY OLD
WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THOSE RESCUED HORSES
SOME COULD END UP BEING DESTROYED AND I'LL BE LOOKING INTO THAT LATER
WE DO EVERY YEAR
IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME
TO HEAR THAT IF YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT A FLY GRAZED OR NEGLECTED HORSE
IT COULD END UP BEING ROUNDED UP
I' GOING TO BE PLANTING SOME NEW SPECIES THAT WILL BE TAKING ROOT IN TWENTY SIXTY
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR COUNTRYFILE CALENDAR
BUT I'M A RUBBISH DAD
VISIT OUR WEBSITE AND TELL US WHY THEY DESERVE TO BE OUR NEXT FARMING HERO
IT'S OVERDU TO HELP FIND THE COUNTRYFILE FARMING HERO FOR TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN
I FOUND A BABY BIRD
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS
BUT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SPOTTING RAPTORS
NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO SEE BUZZARDS SOARING AND TO HEAR TAWNY OWLS AND FOR THAT
BUT JUST LIKE BUDDHA HERE
KEEPING A SILENT WATCH OVER THE GROUNDS
ESPECIALLY TODAY AS IT'S KEVIN'S WEDDING DAY
ARE YOU STILL CALLING HER MRS FEATHERSTONE
YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN HOUSE
APART FROM MRS FEATHERSTONE
IT TAKES A BETTER CLASS OF PERSON
FOR PEERS OF THE REALM
NO WONDER SHE'S INSECURE
I THINK THERE'S STILL A PLACE FOR ROMANCE
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE BEST WAY TO RELIEVE PRESSURE IS TO TREAT YOURSELF
YOUR WIFE WON'T BELIEVE YOU
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
YOU'LL MISS MORE THAN PLACES
I NEVER HAVE TIME FOR A ROLL
I KNOW THAT MR NEWBOLD IS PURSUING ME
BUT THERE'S STILL TIME FOR SOMEONE WITH A BACK POCKET AS FULL AS YOURS
I'M NOT SAYING THAT I DIDN'T ENJOY IT
HE CAN ONLY GET AS FAR AS THE YARD
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT
I TELL YOU WHAT
WHAT WOULD DO IS
I THINK YOU'RE GETTING
I PAID GOOD MONEY FOR THIS ANCIENT SACRED ITEM
A GIANT EMERGED FROM AN ENORMOUS EGG
HE COINED THE TERM BIG BANG
THAT THE UNIVERSE SOMEHOW WAS CREATED OUT OF NOTHING IN AN ALMIGHTY EXPLOSION
WHEREAS THE BIG BANG WOULD
AND TO HIS MIND COULD
HUBBLE'S EXPANDING UNIVERSE CAUSED A STIR BECAUSE OF WHAT IT IMPLIED
THE DAY BEFORE SMALLER STILL
NO RADIATION AT ALL FROM THE SKY
EXCEPT THAT THEY HAD COATED THE SURFACE WITH A WHITE WHITE STICKY MATERIAL WHICH MIGHT NOT ONLY ABSORB
BOB CAME BACK AND SAID WELL
ALL WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY RADIO SOURCES
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THIS RADIATION WON'T GET IN THE WAY
WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THE BIG BANG SEEMED TO BE WINNING THE TWO HORSE COSMOLOGICAL STAKES
THERE WERE STILL SOME THINGS THE THEORY COULDN'T EXPLAIN
SOME REGIONS THAT WERE SLIGHTLY DENSER THAN OTHERS
THESE SLIGHTLY DENSER REGIONS WOULD GRADUALLY ATTRACT MORE AND MORE MATTER UNTIL
THE LEAST INTENSE REGION WAS ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES AWAY IN THE CONSTELLATION OF AQUARIUS
AND WE COULD BEGIN TO SEE THAT THE UNIFORMITY OF THE RADIATION WASN'T PERFECT
THERE WAS A MOST INTENSE REGION
AS YOU LOOK OFF IN THE SKY
IT'S IN THE CONSTELLATION OF LEO
TO EXPLAIN HOW GALAXIES CAME ABOUT
WHO SPEND THEIR LIVES CREATING STRANGE TYPES OF MATTER BY SMASHING ATOMS TOGETHER AND SEEING WHAT
NATURE WAS QUITE SIMPLE AND IT WAS ONLY THEN AS THE INCREDIBLE TEMPERATURE BEGAN TO COOL OFF
AND THEN SEE WHAT HAPPENS
IT'S A UNIVERSE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT
IT'S ONLY SMALL IN DIMENSION
THE BIG BANG JUST DIDN'T WORK WITHOUT THE RIPPLES IN THE PENZIAS AND WILSON COSMIC BACKGROUND
THE TELLTALE PATCHES OF HOT AND COLD THAT THE U TWO SPY PLANE HAD FAILED TO DETECT
IT'S A PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CAPABLE OF CREATING THE CONDITIONS LESS THAN A BILLIONTH OF A
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTEEN
POINT SEVEN BILLION YEARS
THE BIG BANG'S JOURNEY THROUGH EIGHT DECADES OF PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATE AND SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVOUR
IT WAS TO BE ABOUT ORTHODOXY
THERE WAS TO BE GOD ON ONE SIDE
RUSSIA ON THE OTHER
THIS BOOK WAS PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO
AND JUST AS UNCLE TOM HELPED TO MOBILISE PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST SLAVERY OVER THERE
BUT TO NICHOLAS
HE HAD FULL BLOWN PNEUMONIA
WHEN THE LAND WAS SPLIT UP
A BIT LIKE A HAND GRENADE
WHEN THESE SHATTERED
AND THE LOWER HALF OF ALEXANDER'S BODY WAS SHATTERED
WHICH WOULD HAVE COME FORWARD
ON THE DAY OF ALEXANDER'S EXECUTION
THIS BUER WAS AT SCHOOL DOING HIS GEOMETRY EXAM
SOME OF THE WORKERS BEGAN TO SHOUT
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED
YOUR PAIN IS LEAVING YOU
SO YOU SHOULD GET ON AND DO PLENTY OF SINNING
THERE THEY SHOT HIM AGAIN
BY THE NEXT DAY
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
LENIN DESCRIBES THAT THE LUSTS ARE NOT AS NICHOLAS THE SECOND BUT AS NICHOLAS THE BLOODY
AND THEY HOLD THE IMPERIAL FAMILY AND THE ROMANOV REGIME RESPONSIBLE
LENIN AND HIS COMRADES ARE FIXED ON ONE THING
THERE WAS ONLY ONE SURVIVOR
LIKE IN BRITAIN
THE LIVES OF HIS FAMILY
I WANT TO PLAN MY OWN FUNERAL
RUN OFF TOGETHER
WE NEED CONTINUITY
SHE'S TAKING YOUR MONEY
YOU NEED TO KNOW
I KNOW WHAT I WANT
HAVE TO WRITE THEM DOWN JUST LIKE THEY DID WITH THE BIBLE
THE BRIGHT LIGHT
THAT WASN'T THE DEVIL
SHE TOOK US UP IN THE VAN
HE'S TOLD ABC IT WOULD BE AWKWARD TO GO AFTER THE NOMINATIONS ROW
HE THRASHED SAM GUTH
MOSCOW'S DISMISSED THE REPORT AS A JOKE
I MISS HIM DREADFULLY
REALLY OLD AND ANGRY
THERE WAS NOBODY THERE
WE CAN HALLUCINATE
I'D LOVE SOME MORE PHOTOS BUT
IF YOU DIE A VIOLENT DEATH
I FEEL YOU ARE FLATTERING ME SO YOU CAN GET YOUR OWN WAY
MY HOME IS IN LEATHERBRIDGE
FOUR MORE CONTENDERS TONIGHT
EACH OF WHOM SHOULD BE APPLAUDED FOR PUTTING THEMSELVES THROUGH THE ORDEAL
BUT THAT IS AS MUCH SYMPATHY AS THEY ARE LIKELY TO RECEIVE
IF THEY MAKE IT ALL THE WAY
SO PLENTY TO PLAY FOR
CONGRATULATIONS TO HIM
AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A CONTENDER THE NEXT SERIES
AND YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON TWITTER
WHY SOMEONE TOLD YOU ABOUT THE ROOF
ONCE STACEY IS FULLY AWARE OF THE SITUATION
WHEN DID GOD START SPEAKING TO YOU
BUT HAVING BIPOLAR PUTS YOU IN A MUCH HIGHER RISK GROUP
IT WAS NOT CHEAP
I LIKE IT BECAUSE OF THE MILITARY HISTORY
I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE BATTLE OF SE ASOPOL
SO I THINK IT'S A TEN OUT OF TEN NUMBER FOR
HE PENNED IN EXCESS OF THOUSAND
HE RUBBED SHOULDERS WITH THE GREAT AND THE GOOD
EACH CONTAINING THIRTY FIVE VOLUMES
AND THE LEATHER BOUND EDITION
LIKE THESE ONES
TODAY LET'S FIND OUT WHAT IT'S WORTH
WHEN WILLIAM HEARD THAT HAROLD'S MEN WERE CAMPED SIX MILES NORTH OF HASTINGS
AND FOR THAT REASON ALONE
I'M NOT THE MANAGER
I'M WATCHING YOU
AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY MIGHT BUMP INTO
ALL WE KEPT SAYING IN THE CAR WAS THAT HE WAS APOLOGISING
LEAVING ONE COUPLE ON THE CUSP OF GLORY
STANDING ON THAT CUSP
IT'S JUST BEEN A LOT OF FUN
SO I'VE DECIDED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK
COVERING ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS
I THINK I ENJOYED SCHOOL LOOKING
WHEN I WAS WRITING THE BOOK
BIG ON ON JOINING THE PUBLIC SERVICE
WHETHER IT WAS THE ARMED FORCES OR WHATEVER
THAT'S WHERE QUEEN VICTORIA WOULD ARRIVE BY HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGE
IT'S A THOROUGHLY MODERN PUBLIC SCHOOL
I'M A HOUSEKEEPING MANAGER
SOME THINGS FLEW OUT
STOCKS ARE PLUMMETING
REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER
THAT COMES WITH ITS CHALLENGES
ONE'S WIN'S ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY
HOW DOES IT ALL SIT WITH THIS PLACE
AS I'LL BE FINDING OUT LATER ON
THERE IS STILL FISHING HERE IN CLOVELL BUT
BUT IT'S NOT ON THE SCALE THAT IT USED TO BE
THERE ARE FRESH CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT NEW RESTRICTIONS ON CATCHERS COULD HAVE ON THE
BUT NOT ANY LONGER
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO THINK AGAIN ABOUT WHETHER WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE THIS FAIRLY AND THE NEGATIVE
BELOW FORTY TWO CENTIMETRES
I'LL BE FINDING OUT WHY LATER ON
THE SCIENTIFIC ADVICE IS FOR LANDINGS
I CAN EXPLAIN THIS
THE THE IDEA IS TO GET
WHAT WE WANT AND WHAT WE
ABUNDANT STOCKS AND NO REGULATION
OVERFISHING AND A SLOW RESPONSE
EMERGENCY MEASURES AND AN ANGRY REACTION
BUT THIS PLACE IS NOT A MUSEUM
IT'S A WORKING VILLAGE
AH THE QUESTION IS
YEAH THE MORE WE CAN REDUCE HOW FAR WE TRANSFER FOOD
LOOKING FOR THOSE REMARKABLE PEOPLE WHO EMBODY THE VERY BEST OF OUR COUNTRYSIDE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED YES
AS ELLIE WAS SAYING
ONE THAT LAID WASTE TO ACRES AND ACRES OF INDUSTRY
IT MIGHT HAVE A SMALL ENGINE ON IT
DESPITE BEING THE WORLD'S FIRST
THEY'D GET OVER IT
HE'D COCKED IT UP A BIT
IT WAS A BIT TOO NARROW
IT'S BECOME A BIT MIDDLE AGED
RATHER THAN IN A SUBVERSIVE CARD SWAPPING EXERCISE IN A SCHOOLBOY' LAVATORY IN ROTHERHAM
TIME TO FIND OUT
IT'S THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD
THE E TYPE JAG WAS A GREAT CAR FOR WINNING THAT GAME THEREFORE IT WAS A BETTER CAR BUT THAT'S NOT
YOU WERE FUNDAMENTALLY A GODDAMNED COMMUNIST
THE FORD FALCON
I'VE LEARNED A LOT OF INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE AMERICAN MOTOR INDUSTRY
ABOUT THE TEENAGE LIVES OF THOSE GUYS
HAVING A LAUGH AND DOING STUFF ON THE BACKSEAT OF THE MUSTANG TWO
WITHOUT REALISING THAT HIS ENGINE WAS TOO BIG
IT WAS TOO HEAVY
BUT FUEL ECONOMY IS BORING ON THE TELEVISION
AND THEN THERE WAS HONDA
IT WAS COMPLETELY BAFFLING
BMW TRIUMPH AND TRIUMPH FADED AWAY
DISAPPEARED AND GONE
AND THE NEXT TRIUMPH AFTER THE DOLOMITE WAS THE ACCLAIM
WHICH WAS REALLY JUST A LICENSE BUILT HONDA
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT
HE'S TAKING A PICTURE
PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER CAR MAKER
BUT IT'S MORE FAMOUS
FOR BEING THE SITE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST ATOMIC ATTACK
A COMPLETELY MODERN ONE
I'M GOING TO GO BEHIND THE SCENES
EVEN BOYS OUT THERE
THEY'LL THEY'LL USE THE INSPIRATION OF THE CATWALK
AND THAT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE NOW
WHAT HAPPENS NOW
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS SO DEMOCRATIC NOW
INDIVIDUAL DESIGNER WHO IS ONE OF LONDON'S FAVOURITES
I WAS IMAGINE THIS GIRL
THREE WORDS THAT DESCRIBE WHAT YOU KIND OF ALWAYS THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE CREATING SOMETHING
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS LIKE
EVERYONE IS VERY GLOSSY AND VERY PUT TOGETHER
AND THE REALLY
IT'S SO EXCITING
AND IT'S A SPECIAL SHOW TO BE AT
JOE PASSED AWAY A FEW MONTHS AGO
IT'S ONE TO WATCH
HE'S A P FRIEND OF MINE
YEAH JUST STUFF THAT BUILDS UP OVER TIME
I DO WANT TO GET TO KNOW EVERYONE
JUST ONE STAGE AT A TIME
AND WE HOLD IT TO THE LIGHT
THEY'RE NOT ON THE AGENDA RIGHT NOW
EMBARRASS MY FAMILY
THE HELENA LUBAS IN THE SCHOOL PHOTO
I DON'T NEED A PASSWORD
YOU HAVE A NICE DAY
FRIENDS THAT HE WILL HAVE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
THE EASIERIA BECOME
THE PARTNER OF EX EASTENDERS ACTRESS SIAN BLAKE
FOUND DEAD WITH HER TWO SONS
ARTHUR SIMPSON KENT APPEARED IN COURT IN GARA
HE SAID HE DIDN'T RUN AWAY
BRINGING GALES AND HEAVY RAIN
SO SAYS AN NHS REPORT
SO DID THE OUT OF HOURS HELPLINE
THIS IS THE BRITISH MAN WHO FILMED HIMSELF ABUSING YOUNG GIRLS IN THE PHILIPPINES
IS THE ORIGINAL ONE
IN YOUR BACKYARD
WHAT WEIRD WINTER WILDLIFE YOUVE SPOTTED
WEVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND THE FIRST CAMERA TO DELIVER WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES SOUTH WEST OF HERE
NO SNOW HERE WHATSOEVER
I HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OFF THE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO HERE
NUTS BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT IT DOES GO STRAIGHT BACK TO THEM
LOCALLY THEY COULD BE COMPLETELY WIPED OUT
THEY ARE PROLIFIC BREEDERS AND THEY ARE VERY GOOD AT REOLLONIZING
THEY WILL BE AFFECTED LOCALLY
THERE IS A VERY GOOD REASON FOR THIS
THEY WENT INTO THE MAZE OF THEIR OWN ACCORD TO GET A TREAT OF NUTS
WE DIDN'T MAKE THEM GO IN
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAZE
I JUST HOLD ON TO EM FOR A BIT
HE'S PROBABLY THE FINEST SCIENTIST SCOTLAND HAS EVER PRODUCED
THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOMETHING WE CALL ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION
BUT WE USE THEM FOR SO MUCH MORE
HE'S ON THE PAR WITH EINSTEIN
WITH MANY OTHERS
WHAT APPEALED TO ME ABOUT MAXWELL IS HOW NORMAL HE WAS
AND THEN HE REALISED SOMETHING WAS MISSING
IT WILL SURROUND ITSELF AGAIN WITH AN ELECTRIC
AT THIS MOMENT YOU THINK
A MACHINE LIKE WORLD
AND THAT MACHINE LIKE WORLD WAS WAS WAS WAS WAS PRETTY PRIMITIVE
THE GREAT AND THE GOOD
THIS IS MY LAST DAY
I PICKED IT UP AT THE AIRPORT
SOME TRASHY ROMANCE
I'D LIKE TO MEET SOMEONE
BUT I FORGOT MY SWIM SHORTS
REDDISH BROWN HAIR
I'M NOT ACTUALLY A MEDICAL DOCTOR
I HAVE A PH D IN CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCES
I'VE JUST BETRAYED SOMEBODY I'VE NEVER MET
I FEEL EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
THAT'S THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
WILL OUR EXPERTS BE ON THE MONEY
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT IN JUST A MOMENT
THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT THIS
ONE IS SELLING IT ALL TOGETHER
SOME REAL QUALITY
BUT IF YOU LOVE HORSES
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND SOME EQUINE TREASURES OF OUR OWN
ABOUT FOUR HOURS AGO
WE'RE LOOKING AT SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED POUNDS
WE WANT TO SEE IT SADLY
THE LARKIN FAMILY
YOU SEE HES SPENT WELL SHE HAS SPENT A LOT OF ENERGY FINDING THOSE NUTS RUNNING ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE MAZE AND
IF IT CAN CARRY THEM
WILL HE BE THE MASTERMIND
SO STAY WITH US
MY METABOLISM NEEDS TO RISE TO WARM MY BODY UP
THAT IS ITS PROBLEM
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING
WEVE SET UP A LITTLE CHALLENGE FOR THEM
WHICH WE CALLED THE MOUSE MAZE
WE WANT TO SEE HOW QUICKLY THEY LEARNED TO GET TO THE STASH OF FOOD IN THE MAZE AND HOW MUCH THEY
WE STARTED OFF WITH A FAIRLY EASY MAZE
LINDSY THE SHORT ANSWER TO THAT IS NO
THE NORTH SEA AS MOST OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW IS VERY SHALLOW
SOMETIMES JUST TWENTY TO THIRTY METRE SO WE KNOW THAT SPERM WHALE SONAR WON'T WORK IN THIS
THAT'S THE QUESTION
ON AVERAGE THERE HAVE BEEN SIX A YEAR
BUT WHAT IT DOES DO
IS POINT TO THE FACT THAT THEIR POPULATION MAY NOW BE GROWING
THAT'S WHY WE ARE SEEING MORE STRANDINGS
HE'S HAD THAT EAGLE CAMERA OUT THERE FOR SOME TIME
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN TRACKING THESE BIRDS
COULD THIS HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT AFFECT ON GOLDEN EAGLES
WHICH TYPICALLY FORAGE OVER OPEN AREAS
SO THAT WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO PUT TREES BACK INTO SCOTLAND AND KEEP THE GOLDEN EAGLES
WE WERE LOOKING AT HOW ANIMALS ARE AFFECTED DOWN IN THE VALLEY WHEN THE VALLEY FLOODS
IF THEY ARE SENSIBLE
THEY WILL TAKE COVER
AND WE'VE GOT SOME AMAZING ACTION ON THAT CARCASS YESTERDAY
THREE FOR A DOMESTIC CAT CHARACTER WE SCORE ONE AND THEN WE TOP THEM UP FOR THE SEVEN DIFFERENT CHARACTERS SO
HERE THIS IS AN ANIMAL HANDED INTO THE MUSEUM AS A WILDCAT YOU
BUT IT IS GOOD NEWS THAT THERE ARE SOME AND OF COURSE THE EFFORTS ARE GOING ON TO STILL TRY AND FIND THE
SO STICK WITH US TO SEE THAT
BECAUSE FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS ONE OF OUR CAMERAMEN HAS BEEN TRAILING WILDCATS RIGHT HERE
SEND IN YOUR SUGGESTIONS USING HASHTAG WINTERWATCH
BEFORE WE DO THAT
WE'VE GOT LOTS COMING UP
WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW FAR IT WAS TAKING THE EGG AND ALSO HOW IT WAS HIDING IT WAS IT
ONE OF THE CAMERAMAN IS A GUY CALLED PETE KALESS AND HE HAS BEEN FILMING HOW THIS WEIRD WINTER HAS BEEN
ORGANISING PLANNING STAGES
I WILL SEE TO IT IMMEDIATELY AND I CAN DEAL WITH THAT
SO IF YOU COULD SORT IT OUT
AND TO BE HONEST
IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF CALLING HIM UP AND SAYING
THEY ALSO HAVE A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY NOW
WE WANT TO GET YOU HOME
AFTER PHIL DIED
I DIDN'T WANT TO
I WAS ASHAMED OF WHAT MY HUSBAND DID
YOU FORCED MY HAND
I I HAD TO SAVE MYSELF
YOU KEEP PUTTING ME DOWN
IT WAS FOUNDED BY THREE FRIENDS
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE TO STOP BECAUSE
THEN FROM MY AUNTIE
THAT'S REALLY ALL I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT IT
I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT ON THAT
THAT OUR OWNERS ARE GOING TO FEEL REALLY NERVOUS OR VERY EXCITED
THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE
WE ARE COMING BACK LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME SO STAY TUNED
BECAUSE HOPEFULLY THERE'LL BE ONE OR TWO SURPRISES BUT
WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD WHAT COULD BE BETTER THAN A CREAM TEA
AND LEGEND HAS IT THAT SOME FUN
THE FAMILY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT NEW CULTIVARS AND SPECIES COMING INTO THE UK
IT HAS TO BE VERY LOW PH
BUT BECAUSE OF ALL THE LIMING FOR THE VEGGIES
FOR GREEN TEA IT DOESN'T REALLY NEED TO OXIDISE
AND WHEN SHE DIED
SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED POUND IS RIDING ON THIS
IT'S NOT POURING NOW
THE SUN IS SHINING
THE BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME EVER
AND IF YOU DON'T BRING THAT MONEY BACK
YOU'LL NEVER SEE YOUR MONEY AGAIN
BUT TO HELL WITH THAT
IF YOU WANT TO PHONE
IT WAS BOUGHT IN WORCESTER A FEW WEEKS AGO
SO SAYS NEW BBC RESEARCH
THE GAP WAS WIDEST WITH HIP REPLACEMENTS LAST YEAR
THE NATIVE BRITISH ANIMAL WAS ALMOST WIPED OUT IT WAS CONSIDERED A PEST A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
WARNINGS TONIGHT THE ZIKA VIRUS IS SPREADING EXPLOSIVELY
AN ARMED MAN'S BEEN ARRESTED AT DISNEYLAND IN PARIS
HE WAS CARRYING TWO GUNS AND A COPY OF THE KORAN
NO ONE WAS HURT
LOTS OF CHANGE OF WEATHER AND TONIGHT LET ME TELL YOU WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANGE OF PLAN BECAUSE
AND SO WE THREW IT OUT TO YOU AND SAID COME UP WITH SOME NAMES
MY LOVELY CO PRESENTER CHRIS PACKHAM HAS UNFORTUNATELY COME DOWN AT THE LAST MINUTE WITH A BIT OF A
IT WAS SO FAST THAT
CAN WE SEE THAT MALE COMING IN AGAIN
CAN I DEFEND MYSELF
TO TRY TO STOP THE EAGLE COMING IN
YOU THE FOX IS A BIT HEAVIER BUT
THE ACTION CONTINUED
PROGRAM BUT IT REALLY IS AMAZING FOOTAGE
IN THE WINTER ESPECIALLY
TO HELP THEM OUT NOW
BUT IT'S A REAL PLEASURE TO SIT THERE AND SEE WHAT TURNS UP
BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE
WHAT THEY DO IS THEY GO DOWNSTREAM
AND THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS
AND WE SHOWED YOU YESTERDAY
WE'VE HAD A FABULOUS WEEK SO FAR
THEY USE THEM FOR DISPLAY AND FOR FIGHTING
AND UP HERE YOU WOULD BE VERY VERY LUCKY TO SEE ONE OUT IN THE DAYTIME
BUT WE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THEY STASH OR CASH THEIR FOOD
IF YOU'VE JUST JOINED US
CHRIS PACKHAM HAS COME DOWN WITH A STOMACH BUG SO THAT'S WHY HE'S HE'S NOT JOINING US TONIGHT
SO MANY QUESTIONS
WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE
WE'VE ACTUALLY PUT SOME CAMERAS OUT BY THE EGGS THAT THEY'VE CASHED
BECAUSE MANY OF THEM THAT WOULD HAVE MIGRATED FROM VERY COLD AREAS UP IN THE NORTH HAVE NOT
TO THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF MANY BIRD WATCHERS
THOSE WONDERFUL SPECTACLES
AND ONE OF THE PLACES YOU GET FABULOUS MURMURATIONS IS DOWN IN SOMERSET
AND TWO WEEKS AGO IT DID GET VERY COLD
THE STARLINGS ARRIVED AND GARY MO
SOME THINGS WOULD BE VERY OPPORTUNISTIC AND THEY WILL BENEFIT FROM THE FLOODING
AS OPPOSED TO NOT HAVING TREES
IF YOU WON IF YOU VOTED FOR THE MOUSE ONLINE THEN
BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS DEFINITELY WORTH GETTING UP EARLY FOR IF YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THE DAWN
ALWAYS CHOOSE PEOPLE
THE VOLES ARE ON THE GROUND
YOU KNOW WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO DO THAT RELEASE
WHAT'S THE POINT
VERY GOOD QUESTIONS
THEY HAVE TO TRY TO FIND PLACES WHERE THOSE WILDCATS CAN GO WHERE MAYBE THERE AREN'T
THAT'S ALSO BEEN DISCUSSED
BUT SOME PEOPLE THINK AS WELL THAT THERE MAY BE OTHER POPULATIONS OF WILDCATS OUT THERE ALREADY
THE CAMERA THAT WAS FILMING THAT
THAT'S IT FOR TONIGHT
YOU NEED A BREAK
AND TONY PEBBLE ON THE OTHER
IF YOUR DEMOS ARE AS GOOD AS THIS AM
I'M GUESSING YOU INSTEAD OF ME
THERE HE WAS IN ONE AND THEN HE WAS IN ANOTHER
TAKE EVERYTHING ELSE BUT
I CAME UP WITH A GREAT GAME JUST YESTERDAY CALLED CRAZY MULE
OR HE MIGHT JUST BUCK IT ALL OFF
WHY CAN'T I HAVE MY
AND WELCOME TO FISHING WITH ROCK STARS
WELCOME TO THE SHOW
READ BY MARTIN FREEMAN
I GOT A CALL FROM HIS MUM ONE MORNING
THE PLACE WAS ABSOLUTELY COVERED WITH EMPTY SEVEN SEAS BOTTLES
I'M ON THE SEGWAY
I ALWAYS TOLD YOU I'D BE A FRONTMAN
PAID FOR THE TERMINATION
THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE MONEY IS TO PLAY LIVE
WHICH IS WHY YOU'VE GOT A CAPACITY CROWD OUT THERE AND GOD KNOW A MILLION STREAMING ONLINE
GET OUT THERE AND END FUCKING JOY YOURSELVES
MY PARENTS ARE NOT COMING
I DID INVITE THEM BUT
YOUR FATHER'S HERE
YEAH HE'S IN THE CORRIDOR
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE
SOME THEATRICS AND ALSO
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE BARRY
I PUT EVERYTHING IN THE REPORT
FOUR CONTENDERS ARE WAITING TO TAKE THEIR PLACE IN THE BLACK CHAIR
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT KNOWING THE ANSWERS
THEY GET TWO MINUTES OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND THEN TWO AND A HALF ON GENERAL
AND YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON TWITTER
THANKS FOR WATCHING
IN THE WINTER TIME
BUT IN THE WINTER
IT NEEDS THOSE BIG
BROAD WINGS SO IT CAN SEARCH OVER VAST AREAS FOR CARRION
ON THE OTHER HAND
REMAINS MORE OF A PREDATOR THROUGH THE WINTER
EARLIER IN THE WEEK
VERY ATTRACTIVE ANIMAL THAT WE'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE HERE THIS WEEK AND WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME
I WOULD GUESS THE SAME
CAUSE CASHING IN THIS WEATHER IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT AN ANIMAL DOESN'T WANT TO WASTE ANY SORT OF ENERGY COMING OUT IN THE WET
IF IT'S WET AND RAINY
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO OUT TO THE SUPERMARKET
SO IT A VERY SENSIBLE
ALL THIS WEEK
WEVE BEEN HAVING A BIT OF AN EAGLE FEST
I SHALL BE OUT GOING TO TRY AND SEE MY FIRST EVER CHINESE WATER DEER
PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY
AND IT WAS VERY PRECISE BEHAVIOUR
AND THAT THERE IS AN OVERALL DECLINE IN THE POPULATION OF MOUNTAIN HARES IN SCOTLAND
THAT THERE IS MANAGEMENT OF MOUNTAIN HARES IN PLACE BEFORE ANYONE REALLY KNOWS THE POPULATION
THE LATEST RESEARCH
THEY HAVE LEARNED THAT THEY GET FREE FOOD IN THAT LANDFILL SITE
OUR MICE HAVE LEARNED THAT THEY GET FREE FOOD IN THE MAZE AND EVERY NIGHT
IT TOOK THAT MOUSE THREE MINUTES TO DO THAT EXPLORATION
SURVEY SEASON TO GO AND
SO WELL FINISH
SO THAT'S THE MOUSE
S GOING INTO THE MAZE
WELL THE MOUSE IS EXERCISING ITS WORKING MEMORY AND WORKING MEMORY IS A TYPE OF SHORT TERM MEMORY
THE MORE YOU EXERCISE THAT MEMORY
IT BECOMES STUCK IN YOUR MIND AND YOU CAN REMEMBER IT
THEY TAKE THE MICE OUT
DISRUPTED BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS
ONCE IT'S LEARNED IT IT REMEMBERS IT FOR A LIFETIME
AND THEN IF THEY TEST THOSE MICE WITH OTHER COGNITIVE TESTS
THEY ARE CONSIDERABLY MORE INTELLIGENT
SO WE'VE COME ALONG HERE
RELIABLE METHOD OF COUNTING
DON'T FORGET TO KEEP CHECKING THE WEBSITE
AND THAT'S GIVEN CAMERAMAN MARK PAYGI A GOOD EXCUSE TO PICK UP HIS CAMERA AND NEARLY ALL OF HIS
AND THAT'S WHY OUR WILDLIFE DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S COMING OR GOING
WELCOME TOLOG IT
AND IF THEY WERE LUCKY ENOUGH THEY WOULD BRING HOME A PAINTING BY ONE OF THE GRAND EUROPEAN MASTERS
TURNER MAY BE THE MOST FAMOUS PAINTER REPRESENTED HERE
AND IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE MEETING YOU AND SHOWING ME AROUND
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS EXCITING
SOMEBODY WAS REALLY AFTER THAT
WE ARE COMING BACK LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
BUT ALSO FINE BUILDINGS
FROM THIS ELEVATION
THERE IS EVIDENCE OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT PERIODS OF HISTORY
BRIDGES AND SHIPS
IN A SMALL CORONET
AN ANGEL WITH OUTSTRETCHED WINGS
IT'S BUILT THIS COUNTRY
WHICH IS THE MEDIEVAL FESTIVAL OF SPRING
AND HERE IN CHESHIRE
NOT ONLY DID THEY CONSTRUCT FINE TIMBER FRAME BUILDINGS BUT
AND THIS IS THE ORIGINAL FRONT DOOR
SOMEBODY WAS TRYING TO FORCE AN ENTRY
CONSTRUCTED OF OAK
AND HERE WE ARE IN THE MEDIEVAL GREAT HALL
WHICH IS THE OLDEST PART OF THE HOUSE AND
THAT IS INCREDIBLY HEAVY
WELL BEHIND THE SCENES
THERE ARE BATS IN THE BELFRY
AND WITH SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS OF HISTORY BEHIND IT
IT CAN ONLY BECOME AN EVEN MORE FASCINATING EXPERIENCE IN THE YEARS TO COME
SO WHAT THEY WOULD DO
BUT DIDN'T QUITE CONQUER
SET FAIR TO TAKE ON THE BIGGEST TEST YET IN THE COMPANY OF A MAN ABOUT WHOM WE ARE ALL IN THE DARK
BECAUSE THE STICK IS NOT SHORT OF CHOICE WHEN IT COMES TO CARS
YOU CANNOT SPEAK AND HEAR AT THE SAME TIME
AND I WANT TO BE GENEROUS
CAN I DO IT ON MY OWN
IT IS NOT YOUR OFFICE
ABOUT TWENTY MILES WEST OF SAMOA
GIVE ME THE DETAILS WILL
SHE BLED TO DEATH IN FRONT OF ME
NO SUCH LUXURY AS A BIKE
AND THE FIRST PLACE I WORKED WAS SOMEWHERE CALLED THE T RANGE
THEY NOT QUITE AS GLAMOROUS AS THIS
BUT WE DID STILL HAVE THIS
THE GIANT WATER LILY
TALKING ALL THE NICE PLACES
THE CANARY ISLANDS
AS WELL AS HOW TO PLANT A KIWI FRUIT AND THE BEST GARDENING KIT MONEY CAN BUY
A LOOK AT WHAT THE VICTORIANS DID FOR US
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY FLOWERS ON THEM
YOU CAN ACTUALLY KEEP GOING ALL DAY LONG AND JUST KEEP CHANGING THE BATTERIES
AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY
AS WELL AS IT BEING SILKY SMOOTH
BUT WITH THE WIND FROM THE FANS
THE WILDER THE WEATHER
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ARCTIC'S ALL ABOUT
NOT JUST BY A WOMAN BUT
LEARN THE SKILLS
LEARN THE SECRETS
BUT WE WERE HOPING THAT IT WOULD SHOWCASE EXACTLY WHAT WE DO
BUT DON'T LIVE ON A FARM
THE DRAGONS SIT IN WAIT
SO THEY'LL ONLY POUNCE WHEN THE DEAL IS RIGHT
HE'S JUGGLING RUNNING A BUSINESS WITH BECOMING A PARENT FOR THE FIRST TIME
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO
HANDLING THE DRAGONS SHOULD BE EASY IN COMPARISON
ALL AH ALL I DO KNOW IS I'M READY FOR A NEW CHALLENGE
I APPRECIATE YOUR POINTS
I AM MOST GRATEFUL FOR YOUR FOR YOUR OFFER
IT'S FALLING APART
DELIVERED BY TWO ENTREPRENEURS WITH A BUSINESS GUARANTEED TO KEEP BRITAIN'S CHOCOHOLICS
IF NOT NECESSARILY ITS DENTISTS
CONGRATULATIONS TO THEM ALL
THE REALLY HARD WORK STARTS NOW
A HORSE IS RARELY STUCK
THE COMING OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION RELIEVED THE HORSE AND THE DONKEY
AND THE MULE AND THE ELEPHANT
BUT THESE BEASTS STILL HAVE SOMETHING TO TEACH US
WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD
IT WAS WILLYS WHO WON THE CONTRACT
WHO FIDDLED WITH THEM A BIT
RUGGED FOURBYOUR VEHICLE USING READILY AVAILABLE MATERIALS
TO KEEP THE COMPANY TICKING OVER WHILE THE ECONOMY RECOVERED AND PEOPLE STARTED BUYING PROPER CARS
IT HAD PROVED THE WORTH OF A LIGHT
ALL TERRAIN CAR
IT REALLY HAD PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN SAVING THE WORLD
IT'S A BIT LIKE SAYING MELTON MOWBRAY ARE CRAP AT PIES
AH WORLD WAR TWO WAS EXCELLENT NEWS
COME THE DEFEAT
STILL DISCOURAGED BY THE OCCUPYING FORCES FROM MAKING PASSENGER CARS
SUSAN FOUR WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLES TO THE NPR THE NATIONAL POLICE RESERVE
IT HAS TURNED INTO A LUXURY CAR
GENERAL STONEWALL JACKSON
SEVENTY PLUS YEARS ON FROM THE GLOBAL INVASION BY WILLYS JEEP
DCI GENE HUNT DOESN'T SAY
BUT THERE WAS MORE TO IT THAN THAT
THERE WAS THE PROVENANCE THAT CAME WITH DRIVING THE CONQUERING HERO OF THE RALLY WORLD
AND BY REPUTATION
THERE WAS THE RELIABILITY
THE SUZUKA SKYLINE
VERY POPULAR BECAUSE OF ITS WINDING CURVES
WITH LOCAL JAPANESE
MY HIGH PERFORMANCE ROAD CAR HAS FOURHE DRIVE
AND WHEN IT RAINED
AND IT POSSIBLY IS
STYLE AND EXCLUSIVITY WERE DEMOCRATISED BY THE FORD MUSTANG AND THE CAPRI
SPORTS CAR PERFORMANCE WAS DEMOCRATISED BY THE HOT HATCH
GENUINE COMPETITION BREAD
ALL WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEMS WERE DEMOCRATISED BY THE LIKES OF THE SUBARU IMPREZA
WHICH IS IRONIC REALLY
BUT IT ALMOST CERTAINLY OWES A DEBT SOMEWHERE TO ONE OF THE GREAT CARS OF THE PEOPLE
WHICH IS A MARVELLOUS THING
MY OWN RESEARCH
THE THEATRE OF WONDER
I WAS A BIT WORRIED
YOU WANT IT TO ENDURE
SITTING IN BINGO HALLS
I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYONE HERE
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO
BUT I PROMISE YOU
THIS IS UTTERLY RIDICULOUS
THE DOCTOR SAID THOUGH
THEY'LL GIVE YOU ALL KINDS OF HELP
THEY'LL GIVE YOU SUPPORT
DON'T YOU WORRY YOURSELVES
YOU'LL BE PACKED OUT
AND SHE'S IN HOSPITAL
IF YOU WANT TO HIDE THIS
WATCHING YOU WITH HIM
ACTING LIKE HE'S NOT YOURS
I THOUGHT I COULD
JOEL IS IN THE PAST
I CAN'T HELP YOU
MY SON'S IN A COMA
IS THAT TOO MUCH DETAIL
WE WENT OUT A FEW TIMES
THIS IS ABOUT ADAM
ONLY BECAUSE I HAVE SUCH A SUPERB ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM BEHIND ME
I HAVE BEEN BUSY WITH THE MINUTES
ESPECIALLY ON YOUR OWN
THAT'S WHY HE'S REFUSING TO SIGN THE ORDER
WHEN HE TRAVELLED
I THINK HE COULD WELL BE A FARNELL BEAR
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEM
IT IS IT IS A MATERIAL THAT DOES CRACK
I THINK WE FOUND SOME REAL GEMS THIS MORNING
WE HAD SOME CELLS
WE ARE COMING BACK LATER ON
IT MAY LOOK LIKE A QUIET OLD CORNISH TOWN
BECAUSE AN ANCIENT BATTLE TAKES PLACE ONE THAT'S BEEN FOUGHT SINCE BEFORE RECORDS BEGAN
EVENTUALLY GETTING IT TO ONE OF THE GOALS
ALL I HAVE TO DO NOW IS A COUPLE OF HOURS POLISHING ON THIS ONE
IF YOU WANT TO PUT A
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT
YOU'VE GOT TO LIKE THIS
BECAUSE FRED WAS A LOCAL BOY
SOMETHING SOMEBODY WANTS
THERE'S COMMISSION TO PAY
IT'S THE LOVELY AMERICAN COMPACT
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO
YOU LOVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH
I'M NOT ABANDONING HER
IT'S KILLING ME
NO DETAILS ON WHAT WAS WRONG
BUT THE FIRM SAYS THERE'S NO EVIDENCE IT WAS A MALICIOUS ATTACK
DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T WIN THE FIRST VOTE
RIVAL REPUBLICAN TED CRUZ TOOK IOWA
FOR THE DEMOCRATS
A VERY SLIM VICTORY FOR HILLARY CLINTON OVER BERNIE SANDERS
DAVID CAMERON WELCOMED IT
WE COULD NOW VOTE ON WHETHER TO STAY OR LEAVE THE EU AS EARLY AS JUNE
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE TRENT
THE CANAL VISIONARY KNOWN AS THE SCHEMEMA
LIVERPOOL IN THE WEST
THE GREAT BENEFACTORS OF THE TOWN
WITHOUT A WORD TO ANYONE
COULD BE HEARD THE CREAKING OF CRANES
I PERSONALLY WENT OUT TO TO BURTON AT THAT TIME
IN SOME CASES HEELED OVER
GREAT EXPANSE OF WATER AROUND ME
DREAMING ABOUT RIVERS
BUT I HAVE NEVER
THEY DIED BECAUSE OF WHATEVER'S GOING ON ON THIS FARM
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
THEY FOUND THE GIRLS
WHAT YOU DO NEXT
WE WERE CLEANING UP
MY LIFE IS OVER
WE MIGHT HAVE A CASE
THE IRISH PLAYED A VERY DIFFERENT ROLE
IT WAS THE IRISH THAT BROUGHT CIVILISATION TO BRITAIN
WHEN MY JOURNEY BEGINS
IRELAND WAS JUST TOTALLY DIFFERENT
AND BECAUSE WARFARE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENDEMIC
NOT KNOWING THE LANGUAGE
CAME FROM THE NORTH
UNLESS THEY WANT TO JOIN THE DEAD
THIS IS ABOUT SURVIVAL
THEY WORSHIPPED THE SUN
VERY OUTSPOKEN WHEN IT CAME TO PEOPLE BEING ATTACKED
TO TRAIN PEOPLE
BECAUSE OF HIS CHRISTIANITY
THIS WAS AS FAR WEST IN EUROPE AS CHRISTIANITY HAD EVER COME
THE HUNDREDS OF MILES THAT WAY
SOME TO THE WEST OF BRITAIN
THOUSANDS MORE ACROSS THE CHANNEL TO THE CONTINENT
VERY FEW LONE WORDS
YOU CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE HAVE POSTULATED IN THE PAST
NEW MATERIALS WERE BEING ISSUED LIKE MORTAR
IS THE OLDEST TIDAL MILL IN THE WORLD
THEY WEREN'T PLACES WHICH REALLY INTERACTED WITH THE REST OF THE LANDSCAPE IN ANY KIND OF SERIOUS
WHAT THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY'S SHOWING US
IN FACT THERE WERE DOZENS OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT THE EMPIRE
WERE SHUT UP FOREVER
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE IRISH MONASTERIES AND THE MONKS WORKING IN THEM
AND IF IT'S TOO HUMID
BUT THEY HELP THE SPREAD AND PRACTICE OF CHRISTIANITY
AND THEY'RE FOSTERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF IRISH AS A NEW
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN
BECAUSE OF CHRISTIANITY
BECAUSE OF THIS THIS KIND OF MOVEMENT OF MONASTIC COMMUNITIES FROM NORTH AFRICA ALONG THE ATLANTIC
SO WHAT IT DOES
BUT IT HAS ITS FAULTS
LOOKING AT ROCK AT AH
AH WHY WAS IT ABANDONED
BUT RIGHT NOW FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
I DON'T THINK THE TEAM WILL NEED THEIR BONUS BUY
THERE IS A GREAT REVIVAL OF TEA DRINKING ALONG WITH THESE HOME BAKED CAKES
NO SHAME IN THAT
THAT'S MINUS TWENTY
THAT COULDBE WINNING SCORE
THEY WERE AROUND SIXTY FIVE DEGREES
ITS PREMIER LEAGUE FOOTBALL CLUB AND FOR FEATURING IN THE LYRICS OF A BEATLES SONG
A DAY IN THE LIFE
NOBODY MADE THIS
I DID ADVISE THEM TO LEAVE IT WHERE IT WAS
AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
THIS COLLARY HERE AT ALEY GREEN
IN SOUTH LANCASHIRE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT
AT ONE POINT THERE WERE AROUND SEVENTY CLUBS IN THE COUNTRY
TODAY THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY
THIS IS ONE OF THEM
WITH SOMETHING OF THIS AGE
AND FINGERS CROSS THE TWICE THE TOP END
BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH IT
IT'S PETER PAN BY BARRIE
JOIN US NEXT TIME FOR MORE SURPRISES
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID
SLIGHTLY OF THE LATE THIRTY S
PEOPLE LIKE THIS
WE NEED TO REINFORCE THE BORDERS
THERE WILL BE A LOT
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF INTELLIGENCE ASSETS WORKING
WE'LL HAVE A VERY GOOD PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON
AND THEREFORE I'M SURE THEY CAN COME UP WITH A PLAN AND ACTION IT
IT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE IF THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING IN TERMS OF TRYING TO COUNTER THAT
POLAND OF COURSE AND THE OTHER BALTS ARE KEEN
THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS
WE NEED TO RESPOND TO THAT FORMALLY
IS JUST A PART OF THAT
THEY DON'T SEE THAT AS ANYTHING STRANGE
AND THEREFORE I THINK WE NEED TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY OF WHAT IS THE READINESS
ALL OF THEIR COMMAND
WE ARE ACTUALLY CORRECTING THINGS IN LATVIA
LET'S NOT LET THIS BECOME ANYTHING
WE'RE NOT ATTACKING RUSSIA
WE ARE AGREED TO JOIN THE AMERICAN LED CODE
MEMBERS OF THE COALITION OF THE WILLING
IT WIPES OUT THE FACT THAT HE'S GONE BEYOND THE RULES
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING TO DO
WHETHER IT'S BEFORE OR AFTER
IS NOT GOING TO SAVE THOSE POPULATION CENTRES
IT DOES NOT CHOOSE POPULATIONS
YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO GET NAKED
WHEN I WAS THEIR AGE
IT'S EVERYBODY'S OWN CHOICE
MAYBE SOME PEOPLE SAY YEAH
TWENTY TIMES MORE MONEY
SO I WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST ONE TO BE TALKING ABOUT SEX
ANYONE CAN CHANGE ANY MINUTE
UM DOING WEBCAM STUFF
THIS IS LIKE REAL LIFE NOW
NOT CRUSHING THEM AS SUCH
WHICH IS REALLY HARD
OF COURSE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT
IS THAT OK WITH YOU
OUT CAUSE IS BETTER FOR ME AS I WILL TRAVEL FROM PORTSMOUTH
IT'S NEARLY THREE HOURS
PETE'S REPLY IS HEY
AND MY MU WAS SHE WAS THERE WITH ME LIKE
THANKS FOR PLAYING
WHAT IS YOUR IDEA
NO WORST CASE SCENARIO
AS WELL AS THAT
MY FIRST PHOTO SHOOT
THE HOSPITALS WERE ALREADY BUSY DEALING WITH WAR CASUALTIES AND THERE WASN'T ENOUGH ROOM TO DEAL
AND THIS WAS VERY PROBLEMATIC
THERE WAS NO ONE OVERSEEING
SAY FOR EXAMPLE
ISOLATION WAS THE KEY
THEY BUILT ISOLATION HOSPITALS
BE PERHAPS RUN BY ONE DOCTOR
YOU HAVE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SUNLIGHT LEAGUE
THEY COULDN'T READ LABELS ON BOTTLES
SO WORKING CLASS PEOPLE
VERY POOR PEOPLE
I WANT YOU TO COME AND TAKE MY APPENDIX OUT
HE SHOWED UP STRAIGHT AWAY
AND HE DRAPED EVERYTHING IN THE WHOLE ROOM WITH WHITE SHEETS
BUT I THINK NANCY AND A GAY GROUP OF FRIENDS CAME ROUND ABOUT THE SAME TIME AND THEY THOUGHT THAT WE
ATTEND THE HOME WITH THE PATIENT
THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE ANAESTHETIST
WHO WOULD COME WITH THE DOCTOR TO ANESTHETISE THE PATIENT
AND THEN THE SURGERY WOULD BE DONE ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE AND THEN THE PATIENT WOULD GO BACK TO
USUALLY WITH THE AID OF A PROFESSIONAL NURSE
AND IF YOU HAD AN INTERESTING CASE
THEN YOU MIGHT BE TAKEN IN FOR TREATMENT
WAS THE EXTREMELY HIGH INCIDENCE OF CAR UM
AND UP TILL THEN
PEOPLE HAD BEEN LAID UP FOR
THREE MONTHS OR SOMETHING
BUT THE PATIENT DIED OR WHATEVER
ESPECIALLY BY THE PATIENTS
A LOT OF PATIENTS REGARDED THESE PEOPLE AS SAVIORS
THEY WEREN'T PAID FOR THEIR SERVICES
BUT THEY WERE NOW HAVING TO PAY MUCH LARGER LEVELS OF TAXATION
BUT THE MONEY IS GOING TO A GOOD CAUSE
UM YOU HAVE AN EGG WEEK
IT MIGHT SEEM INSIGNIFICANT
BUT ONE HOSPITAL MIGHT COLLECT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
AND EGGS AND THAT WOULD FEED A LOT OF PATIENTS
BUT IF YOU WAS WELL OFF
AND IF THEY WERE BELONGING TO A SCHEME WHICH GAVE THEM FREE HOSPITAL TREATMENT
I WOULD PUT HSA
COULD THEY PAY FOR TREATMENT
THEY IDENTIFIED PATIENTS WHO NEEDED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WITHIN THE COMMUNITY
THEY NEEDED HELP FINDING WORK
TO TALK ABOUT THE PATIENTS IN THE WARD
WE HAD THIS EXPERIMENTAL BOARD
SO HERE WAS THE FIRST
RADIUM IS THE CROWN JEWEL IN THE RAY BASED THERAPIES THAT BEGIN TO EMERGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
THEY SAW THEM AS THE RIGHT PLACE TO GET MEDICAL TREATMENT
YOU SEE THE RISE OF WAITING LISTS
NOT DOZENS OF PEOPLE BUT
EVEN THOUGH HOSPITALS WERE MUCH MORE PLEASANT
THE WORKHOUSE INFIRMARIES
AND CONSULTANTS COULD MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF RESENTMENT ABOUT THEIR HIGH HANDED ATTITUDE OR THE FACT THAT THEY WEREN'T
THOSE CHILDREN WHO WERE BORN IN SOME OF THESE INSTITUTIONS
THEY SIMPLY PUT AN ADDRESS
NOT THE NAME OF THE INSTITUTION
BECAUSE THE STIGMA WAS STILL VERY STRONG
ON THE BASIS OF INFORMATION
IT KIND OF HAPPENED
WHEREAS THE SECOND WORLD WAR
THE COUNTRY WAS PREPARING
WHEREAS IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR
PEOPLE DID NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN
THEY WANTED THINGS TO CHANGE
WE COME THIRTY MILES OR SO NORTH FROM LEMSTER TO THE LOVELY TOWN OF SHREWSBURY
IN CASE YOU FAIL
EVERY BABY IS DIFFERENT
TAKING THE BABY THERE MUST BE ANOTHER WAY
IF THEY'VE RUN OFF TOGETHER AND
I'LL COME ROUND
MAKE SURE SHE EATS
WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING THE JOB THAT WE'RE TRAINED FOR
WE'LL HAVE THE INITIAL FIRST AID TEAMS
SIX BOATS LOADING TODAY ALL AT THE SAME TIME
IF YOU CAN'T BE WITH KUSH
YOU GAVE UP THE FIRST CHANCE OF BEING A PARENT
HAS AGE UK BEEN PROMOTING COSTLY GAS AND ELECTRICITY DEALS TO OLDER PEOPLE IN RETURN FOR MONEY FROM
THE REGULATORS ARE INVESTIGATING
EFFORTS CONTINUE TO RESCUE THE MAMMAL BUT EXPERTS SAY IT'S UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE
ANOTHER WHALE DIED NEARBY LAST MONTH
MEET THE NEW TOP GEAR PRESENTER
AH FORMER FRIENDS STAR
IS TO STAR ALONGSIDE CHRIS EVANS
THAT'S HOW MUCH BRITAIN'S PLEDGED TO HELP THE VICTIMS OF THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA
WELL LEADERS MET AT A SPECIAL CONFERENCE IN LONDON
BUY SOME NIGERIAN FOOD
THE FRITTER WAS LOVELY
SEE WILL MONDAY
WHEN WE DID CAREERS
THIS WASN'T EVEN CONSIDERED
COULD YOU CHECK AND REPORT BACK
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO FOLLOW AFTER THIS
SOMETHING BREAKS DOWN
FOUR MORE CONTENDERS ARE ALL SET TO TAKE TO THE STAGE TONIGHT
OR AT LEAST THEY HOPE THEY ARE ALL SET
THEY GET TWO MINUTES EACH FOR THE FIRST ROUND AND THEN TWO AND A HALF FOR THE SECOND
THANKS FOR WATCHING
IN THEIR ART GALLERY
IT CONTAINS THE LARGEST SINGLE COLLECTION OF HIS WORK
IT'S WELL WORTH A LOOK
MY SENSE OF ANTICIPATION GETS HIGHER AND HIGHER
ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN
BUT ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON
AND ONE OF EUROPE'S MOST MODERN
ACCORDING TO THE GUINNESS BOOK OF RECORDS
THIS HARBOUR IS THE OLDEST BUSINESS IN BRITAIN
IT'S A TRUE SUCCESS STORY
THIS IS GOING TO GET EXCITING
THANK YOU SO MUCH
JOIN US AGAIN FOR MANY MORE SURPRISES
WHY ARE YOU WHY ARE YOU SELLING NOW
I'M TALKING SHOTS
I CAN THROW YOU THE BEST WELCOME BACK NIGHT OUT EVER
I'LL JUST BE A SECOND
I'M NOT A FROSTY PERSON
MY LITTLE RAY OF SUNSHINE
BUT SHE IS STABLE FOR NOW
I DON'T NEED ONE LINERS
I ALMOST FORGOT
THAT REMINDS ME
IT STRUCK ME TODAY WITH SASH
LETTER BY LETTER
BUT IT STILL CAN BE QUITE A BUSINESS
IT'S A BATTLE OVER HEDGES
SO IF YOU DON'T GARDEN ON CHALK OR LIMESTONE BUT YOU DO HAVE GOOD DRAINAGE
I SPEND SO MUCH OF MY TIME TIED TO A COMPUTER ON EMAIL
THE BIG QUESTION IS
AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S REALLY GIVEN ME BACK MY LIFE
WHICH IS A VERY
YOU NEED TO POUR IT OUT
AND FROM THE SPOON IT GOES STRAIGHT DOWN THE PATIENT'S THROAT
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
JUST RELISH THE THOUGHT
FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME
ON THAT HAPPY THOUGHT
PEOPLE WANTING MORE DETAIL ON THE CONDITION IN PARTICULAR
I'LL TAKE FIVE NOW
I LOOK FOR EIGHT NOW
AND THAT MEANS I'M OUT
ONE TEN IN THE STATES
JUST DON'T SAY A WORD TO THE REDS
I'LL TAKE TWO NOW
THE PHONES ARE OUT
YOU'RE OUT THIS TIME
YOU WERE PLUS TWENTY TWO
JOIN US SOON FOR SOME MORE BARGAIN HUNTING
THE LEGENDARY PHIL COLLINS
IN HIS PRESENCE LIKE
BUT IS THIS EXTREME WEATHER SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET USED TO IN THE FUTURE
IT WAS WETTER THAN EVER
IN ONE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD
WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT
I AM GLAD IT'S OVER
LIKE ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY
I THINK IT'S QUITE WORRYING
PEOPLE YOU KNOW HAVE TO MAYBE ACCEPT PERHAPS BIGGER
IS THE INVESTMENT RIGHT
OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
ARE WE PROTECTING THAT WELL ENOUGH
A NONNATIVE SPECIES
FROM WHAT I GATHER
THAT'S VERY TRUE
YOU'LL WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER WILL BE DOING
NEXT WEEK WE'RE GOING TO BE IN NORFOLK
THE WAY OF LIFE
THERE IS NO GREEK BORDER PATROL
FROM WHERE THEY CAN CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEYS ONTO WESTERN AND NORTHERN EUROPE
AND ONE OF THE REVELATIONS THAT CAME OUT DURING AND AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WAS THAT ONLY
THE PLACE IS MORE BEAUTIFUL AND THE PEOPLE ARE MORE PASSIONATE AND ANGRY
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT LEG OF MY JOURNEY
IT IS WORTH A GO
THAT'S ALL WE'VE EVER WANTED OUT OF ALL OF THESE SOURCES OF MOTIVE POWER
A ROTATING SHAFT
WHICH DRIVES THE WHEELS AND
THE MODEL T COULD BE YOURS FOR NOT MUCH MORE THAN A TENTH OF THE PRICE
AND THE MODEL T
TVR IS GOING TO WIN THIS ONE
TVR WITH ALL THIS INNOVATION
BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE IT IN THIS PICTURE
IT IS THE SAFETY BELT
BUT TO MAKE IT FREELY AVAILABLE TO ALL CARMAKERS
AND IT KICKS BUTT
JUST ABOUT EVERY TOWN OR CITY IN THE WORLD HAS A RIVER
IT WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE SIMPLE
I MEAN HE IS A CLEVER MAN
DID I MENTION THAT
ELECTRIC URBAN TRANSPORT SOLUTION WE WANTED
BECAUSE MARKET RESEARCH WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN US THE HOME COMPUTER
FOR THAT MATTER
AS GEORGE BERNARD SHAW ONCE SAID
DEPENDS ON THE UNREASONABLE MAN
AND A VERY GOOD ONE
ONE OF THEM IS THE ELECTRIC MOTOR
IS A HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE
FOR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS OR SO
ALL OF A SUDDEN
BUT IT IS VERY MUCH WORK IN PROGRESS
I KNOW ABOUT CURTIS BROWN
HE WAS A C STUDENT AT BEST
IT TAKES OVER
YOU DON'T GET THE HEAT
WHATEVER YOU WANT
AS I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU
POP IT IN THERE WITH YOUR BACON AND THAT MUSTARD AND ALL THOSE DIFFERENT FLAVOURS WORK TOGETHER
ANY OF THOSE SORT OF SLICED COLD MEATS WITH MUSTARD JUST WORKS SO WELL
IF YOU SAW THEM FIRST
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE TOWN HALL
THAT WAS A BIG MOMENT
YOU WERE ADAMANT
THERE'S A REAL HISTORICAL GEM
NOW IT'S NOT JUST A POIGNANT REMINDER OF THIS CITY'S PAST
YET AT ONE POINT IN OUR HISTORY
AND WHEN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FLOCKED TO THE TOWNS AND CITIES LOOKING FOR WORK
AND THEN VERY QUICKLY REALISE THAT THEY'VE LOST SOMETHING IN THE PROCESS
THEY'VE LOST THAT THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY
THANK GOODNESS THIS COURT HAS SURVIVED DEMOLITION
BECAUSE WITHOUT IT
A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR SOCIAL HISTORY WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED
ALONG WITH THE BRICKS AND MORTAR
AND THANKFULLY IT NOW REMAINS A LIVING TESTAMENT TO HOW THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE LIVED IN
WE'VE COME TO THE END OF OUR DAY
SO YOU AIN'T GOT WHITNEYWORK
BUT I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HIS FATHER WAS LIKE
ONLY WHEN MY MATE
AND IT'S LIKE A TOUCH BASE
PUT THAT AWAY NOW
SUICIDE IS NOT AN OPTION
I THOUGHT SHE'D RING SALLY
WHY WOULDN'T THEY
SO I CAN GET A BIT APPREHENSIVE WHEN I TOY WITH THEM
BUT IT'S NOT JUST PUTTING THE CHEESE ON
I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC
MAKE A SAUCE OUT OF IT
ADD IT AT THIS POINT
IF YOU ADD IT WHEN THE CREAM IS TOO WHIPPED
I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP
IF I NEED YOUR HELP
A SURVEY BY CBBC'S NEWS ROUND FOUND THREE QUARTERS OF TEN TO TWELVE YEAR OLDS HAVE ACCOUNTS
THE COUPLE MARRIED LAST YEAR IN HIS HOME TOWN OF DULING
THE CHARITY'S BEEN ACCUSED OF RECEIVING MILLIONS OF POUNDS FOR RECOMMENDING DEALS THAT WEREN'T THE
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO
BECAUSE IT'S MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY
WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY LOVELY PHONE CHATS SINCE SEAN WAS HERE
IF I RANG THE HOUSE
IT'S A FUNNY STORY
ABOUT TIME IS ALL ABOUT SOME DUDE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER
IT'S FROM THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT US LOVE ACTUALLY
WHAT
ABOUT YOUR SITUATION
I'M TRYING TO COPE
THAT'S THE WORST FOOD I'VE EVER HAD
WE DON'T TALK MUCH
UM I'LL CALL YOU SOON
I THINK A FUNERAL SHOULD
THIS IS A PLACE OF WORK
I'LL TRANSFER THE MONEY
I LOVE EVERYTHING DANISH
AND SOME RED MEAT
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE VEGETARIANS
SWITCH OFF BECAUSE THIS PROGRAMME IS REALLY GOING TO UPSET YOU
STRONG RED WINE
WE'VE COOKED APPLE PIE ON TELLY BEFORE
THERE WAS SPLIT OPINION TO WHETHER IT WAS CREATED BY MAN
BUT HAVE A PROPER CUP YEAH
IT'S A WORLD HERITAGE SITE
AND IT'S BY FAR THE MOST POPULAR TOURIST ATTRACTION IN NORTHERN IRELAND
BUT WAS IT CREATED BY NATURE OR LEGEND
THE CAUSEWAY SOON BECAME A TOURIST ATTRACTION
SELLING THE WATER BUT WITH FREE WHISKEY
AND MAKE A WISH
THUS PERPETUATING THE MYTH OF THE
WITH LIFE LIKE COLOURS
MARGARET BEFORE SHE LEFT HAD A CHANGE OF HEART AND SHE'S NOW DONATED HER CUP AND SAUCER TO THE CASTLE
IT BELONGS TO CAROLINE AND DAVID
AND THE HIGHLIGHT FOR ME HAD TO BE THE BIG SMILE ON JANET'S FACE WHEN WE FAILED TO SELL HER COMPACT AND
THIS IS AN AUSTRIAN
AND WHEN I GOT TO THE AGE OF FOUGHT
THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO
THAT COULD BE A WAR ZONE
COULD BE ON HUMANITARIAN MISSIONS
IT'S BEEN A REAL EYE OVER
HE WAS BROUGHT IN BY AMBULANCE
AS LONG AS YOUR BOTH GETTING A BIT WHAT YOU FAN
I'M WILLING TO GIVE YOU A TRIAL BUT
YEAH PROMISED I'LL TAKE HER OUT
EDF AND BRITISH GAS HAVE BECOME THE LAST OF THE BIG SIX ENERGY FIRMS TO CUT PRICES
THEY'LL FALL BY FIVE PERCENT NEXT MONTH
THAT SHOULD TAKE THIRTY ONE POUNDS A YEAR OFF AN AVERAGE BILL
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER GRAVITATIONAL WAVES FROM BLACK HOLES HAVE BEEN DETECTED
MINISTERS SAY THEY WERE LEFT WITH NO CHOICE
BUT IF YOU HAVE NOTHING SPECIAL PLANNED
FOR SOME REASON
THAT WAS CLAIRE
WHAT IF I SAID YOU COULD GO OFF AND
YOU'RE BEING MORBID AGAIN
PUT IT IN A LITTLE DISH
THE CHAIN WENT FROM THE BAR WITH A BELL ON IT
IT'S NOT A JOKE
IT'S THE WORCESTERSHIRE TOWN OF KIDDERMINSTER
INCLUDING THE ROLLING STONES
AND THEY DID HAVE SOME TIE WITH SOME LAND
WHEN YOU TURN THEM BACK
WE ARE COMING BACK LATER ON
PAINSTAKINGLY RESTORING SOME OF THE ROCK HOUSES BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL CONDITION AS THEY WERE IN
THEY ALMOST EMBRACE YOU
REALLY I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING TODAY
THAT'S SO RESOURCEFUL
SO WE CAN DATE THAT PRECISELY
YOU'VE GOT TO COME TO ONE OF THESE
WE'RE ON A ROLL
WE ALL GOT IN INVITEDED ON BOARD THE SHIP FOR A BREAKFAST
AND I'M A WOMAN
SO IT'S ALL DRY
WHICH WAS SURPRISING
FIVE CONTENDERS TONIGHT
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS A SEMIFINAL
THAT MEANS WE HAVE A TIE BREAK
WE ARE NOT AGAINST THE CLOCK THIS TIME
WE DO HAVE A WINNER
THANKS FOR WATCHING
I'M KIND OF GLAD
OUR VENUE FOR OUR VALUATION DAY
THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME
YOU'VE GOT THE ANTIQUES
IN MY EXPERIENCE
NEEDLESS TO SAY
SELLING IT FOR A GREAT REASON
I LOVE THE ROMANTIC REASON
UM SOME OF WHICH WE'D LOVE TO OWN OURSELVES
WHILE I'M IN THE AREA
SO IN KEEPING WITH THAT TRADITION
RIGHT BACK TO SAXON TIMES
SHE WAS KNOWN TO BE INTELLIGENT
CAN WE GO HOME NOW
IT'S MY TURN TO BE THE EXPERT
SHE WON'T LIKE IT IN THERE
MY MOTHER MAYBE
I'M SURE A QUICK HELLO WOULDN'T HURT
OH YOU KNOW SMALL HOSPITAL
I HEAR A CERTAIN SOMEONE'S RETURNED FROM THE US
BUT HE'S STABLE
THEN WITHIN TEN MINUTES
IF YOU'RE ORGANIC
IF YOU'RE NOT ORGANIC
YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING
AND THAT WAS VERY POWERFUL
AN ENORMOUS SECTION OF THE COMMERCIAL HORTICULTURAL INDUSTRY
MUCH HIGHER VIEWS AND
AND KENT IS A GREAT PLACE TO LOOK FOR THEM
NEAR SANDWICH AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT AND WELL KNOWN GOLF COURSES IN THE WHOLE OF THE
THEY'VE JUST FINISHED MATING
THE BEST WAY TO PLANT YOUR POTATOES
AND AN AMAZING DISPLAY OF PEONIES
AND YOU DON'T ACHIEVE THAT BY PUTTING OVER BREAD
WHICH WE ENJOY JUST AS MUCH
BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET IT ANY OTHER TIME OF THE YEAR
AND THEN WE MULCH
AND THEN THERE'S NOT A LOT OF INTERVENTION AFTER THAT
WE TEND TO TRY AND LEAVE IT TO ITS ITS OWN DEVICES
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN TOO COLD
IS A GREAT VIRTUE IN A PUMPKIN OR A SQUASH
BECAUSE IN THE END
MAKE SURE THE SUPPORT IS REALLY FIRM
BECAUSE COME OCTOBER
I GET TO GROW A REALLY BIG
TWELVE SQUARE MILES OF BRITISH FRONT GARDEN NO LONGER EXISTS
HIDE YOUR FACE IN SHAME
BECAUSE UP THERE
THAT PERCENTAGE GOES UP TO A HALF
IT WAS FOR US TO PUT ON OUR HORTICULTURAL TELEPHONE VOICE
I HAVE MOVED HUNDREDS
IF NOT THOUSANDS
BECAUSE THEY ARE MOST OFTEN GRAFTED
BUT IT IS IN THE SAME FAMILY
WE'VE REACHED THE END OF TODAY'S SHOW
IT COMES FROM MY
BUT WITH THIS ONE ITS A REALLY GOOD SIZE
HAVE OUR EXPERTS GOT IT RIGHT
WHY DO WE PUT SEVEN TO NINE
IT'S A GREAT VASE
THEY'VE TRANSFORMED THIS ROOM
IT'S NOT OVERLY GRAND
IT'S JUST THE KIND OF HOUSE YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF LIVING IN
DRINKING GIN AND TONIC
THERE'S A LOT OF IT
WHEN ANIMALS AND HUMANS COMPETE FOR SPACE
SO NOW THAT MONSTER IS GRADUATING FROM THE NURSERY
HOW'S THE NEW BABY SLOTH
AND I'VE WATCHED GROW UP
TRYING TO CLIMB UP A TREE
SHE HAS A BETTER CHANCE
BUT THEY ARE WHAT THEY HAVE
THEY USE REALLY WELL AND
HER BODY POSTURE IS TOTALLY OPEN
THEY'RE REALLY POSSESSIVE
OVER THEIR FOOD
AND IT'S JUST IN ABOUT THE LAST TWO WEEKS
HE SUDDENLY GOT THIS PERSONALITY
ONCE SHE'S OUT THERE IN THE FOREST ON HER OWN
IT'S NOT ALWAYS THINGS THAT THEY'LL ENJOY
THAT WOULD ALSO BE GREAT FOR HER
IF SHE WAS IN THE WILD
AND WITH HER OWN LITTLE MONSTERS
THEN THAT'S ALL I NEED
RECKONED TO BE WORTH AROUND TWO BILLION POUNDS TO THE UK ECONOMY
AND EMPLOYEE OVER SEVENTY FOUR
YOU KNOW HOW FAR AWAY IT IS AND YOU KNOW YOUR RIFLE
THEY SLOW DOWN THE FLOW
IT'S NOT THE SHEEP FARMERS' FAULT
THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE POLICY
AND THE POLICY SAYS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT CALLS PERMANENT INELIGIBLE FEATURES ON YOUR LAND
IF THOSE INCENTIVES OR SUBSIDIES WERE CHANGED SLIGHTLY TO ALLOW YOU TO HAVE MORE SCRUB OR WOODLAND
BUT WE HAVE TO SEE A VERY GOOD REASON
WE NEED SOME GOOD SCIENCE
WE NEED TO SEE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY PROVING SOMETHING
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT I'VE GOT A GREAT DEAL OF EVIDENCE TO SAY IT DOES
SHOW ME YOUR EVIDENCE
SHOW ME A BETTER
COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION
AND TO MAINTAIN ANY ADVANTAGE
AND IT CAN BE EFFECTIVE AS A LAND DRAINAGE MEASURE FOR
BUT IT HAS ITS LIMITATIONS ONCE YOU START TO GET TO THE VERY BIG EVENTS
STAYS A GOOD HABITAT FOR THE BIRDS
WHEN I THINK OF SCOTTISH AGRICULTURE
AND THAT THAT FEED US WAY RIGHT BACK THROUGH THE SUPPLY CHAIN TO TO TO PROCESSORS LOOKING FOR FARMERS TO
AND IF IT'S PUT YOU IN THE MOOD FOR A BIT OF BIRD SPOTTING
YOU'LL WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER HAS IN STORE
IT'S A CHANCE TO STAY IN A COUNTRY THAT THEY'VE COMMITTED TO
AT THE SAME TIME
WITH FOUR AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE
GREEK HEALTH AND SAFETY BEING WHAT IT IS
FOR THIS MOMENT
AND THE JOBS ARE REALLY CRITICAL TO THE COUNTRY AS WELL
THEY HAVEN'T INVESTED IN SOLAR POWER
FOLLOW THE CROSS
TOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS
ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE
THAT THERE ARE WAYS OUT OF THIS CRISIS
BUT THERE ARE WAYS
THERE IS MORE SOLIDARITY
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
HOW DID IT GET THERE
THE VERY MOST DISTANT ONES
ALL OF THEIR ORBITS ARE POINTING OFF IN ONE DIRECTION
YOU COULD GET THE THINGS THE SIX OF THEM LINED UP
IT'S ABOUT A ONE PERCENT CHANCE YOU WOULD GET IT DUE TO CHANCE
BUT IT'S NOT THAT SMALL OF A NUMBER
BUT IF YOU TAKE IT ALSO INTO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE TILTED LIKE THAT
I REMEMBER WHEN ONE OF THEM WAS DISCOVERED A FEW YEARS AGO AND THINKING
THAT'S JUST WEIRD
I'M GOING TO GO PLOT THESE RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHERE THEY ARE
AND IF THEY'RE SITTING RIGHT AT THESE TWO SPOTS RIGHT HERE
UM ONE OF THEM IS RIGHT HERE
FOUR OF THEM ARE EXACTLY RIGHT HERE WHERE WE PREDICTED
WHEN I LOOK AT THOSE OBJECTS ON THOSE WINGS
IN YOUR WORK IN EXOPLANETS
AND WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED BY THE WISE SPACECRAFT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE US SOME AH SOME TIME ON THE BIGGEST TELESCOPES IN THE WORLD
BUT WITH THE BIGGEST TELESCOPE SCOPES IN THE WORLD
IT IS IT IS WELL WITHIN RANGE
I WANT IT TO BE FOUND
ACCORDING TO CURRENT MODELS
THE ACCRETION PROCESS WHICH BRINGS SMALL AGGLOMERATIONS OF MATERIAL TOGETHER AND BUILDS LARGER AND
IF IT DIDN'T FORM OUT THERE
HAVING A FIFTH PLANET THERE ACTUALLY HELPS THOSE MODELS REPRODUCE WHAT WE SEE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM
WHAT WE'VE LOOKED AT SO FAR IS A SOLAR SYSTEM FORMING IN ISOLATION
WITH THE ORBIT SUGGESTED
AT THE FAR REACHES OF ITS ORBIT
THE ALIGNMENT IS NOT SOME OBSERVATIONAL BIAS
IT CAN'T BE A COINCIDENCE
MOST OF THE TIME
IT GETS COMPLICATED
FOR SOME ORBITS
IF THE SEARCH COMES UP EMPTY
THEN THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM HAS SOME REALLY
IT'S BECAUSE I AM WORRIED THAT WE SAW A PATTERN AND MADE UP AN EXPLANATION
THEN THE PATTERN DISAPPEARS
TO SEE IF IT HAS MOONS AND RINGS
AND WHEN IT HAPPENS
THAT WILL WORK WONDERS
MARK'S TAKING ME TO A CONFERENCE THIS WEEKEND
WELL THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH MORALE THROUGHOUT THE NHS
I CAN'T BE HELPED
HE DOESN'T WANT A RELATIONSHIP EITHER
HE'S A NICE MAN
HE WON'T GO TO THE DOCTOR HIMSELF
THAT'S UP TO MARK
BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY WORRIED
I KNOW HE CAN BE PUSHY SOMETIMES
AND WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT YOUNG
WE SHOULD REALLY USE IT
TURN IT INTO A GARDEN FOR EVERYONE
AND WE GET ON AND AND I'M GRATEFUL
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE OWE YOU ANYTHING
I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE INTERROGATED
DID YOU REALLY EXPECT ME TO STAY
THAT'S JUST BUSINESS
THAT'S HOW THIS WORKS
THAT'S WHAT I'M SELLING
WHEN I GRADUATE
PEOPLE JUST PODDING PEAS
THAT WON'T HAPPEN
THAT WAS A WHOLE TAKE RIGHT FROM THE TOP OF THOSE STAIRS RIGHT INTO THE KITCHEN
THEY HAVE A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
WAL IT WORTH
YOU'VE JUST SEEN THEIR FIRST ITEMS
LET'S SEE WHAT THE BI THING
THIS IS WHERE WE PUT OUR EXPERTS' VALUATIONS TO THE TEST
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
I HOPE THEY ARE ON THE MONEY
I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT
WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU
I'M NOT SURE WHERE SHE GOT IT FROM
IT'S JUST AS WELL
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
AND I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER GRANDCHILD
I'M GLAD YOU'RE MAKING FRIENDS
ALL PART OF THE CREATIVE SPIRIT
SO WHICH ONE DID HE PICK
HE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN GOOD IDEAS
THEY WERE RELATIVELY LOW PAID AND THAT'S WHAT THEY HAD
WHAT ABOUT BISCUITS
WHAT ABOUT CHOCOLATE
BUT WHAT ABOUT A BIT OF MASHED POTATO
THAT QUANTITY THERE
WHICH IS ABOUT FOUR O
THE RIGHT HAND PALM OPEN IN THE AIR
THAT THEY DEHYDRATE
CAUSE THEY GREW UP WITH THAT
AND MAKING THAT PROFIT
WHAT'S HOT RIGHT NOW
WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS
THE LAST LAUGH IS ON US
BECAUSE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE
IN A MUDDY FIELD IN STAFFORDSHIRE
TERRY HERBERT STRUCK GOLD
AND I MEAN HE LITERALLY STRUCK GOLD
WHEN I SAW THESE IN THE LINES OUTSIDE
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO YOU
I WANT A BOTTLE OF WINE
BUT DOT'S RIGHT
HE'S MY GRANDCHILD
IT RETRAINS OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM TO FIGHT CANCER
NEXT THING YOU KNOW
I TOLD HIM STRAIGHT
I'M A SOCIAL WORKER
WHICH IS HALF A PACKET
AND IT'S SO IMMEDIATE
YOU PREPARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS
IT'S TAKEN FORTY YEARS FROM THAT SEVENTY S BOX TO COME TO THIS
THEY WILL USE THIS STUFF
FOR SOME REASON
SOUTH OF WATFORD
NOT ONLY AM I TRYING TO FLY THIS AIRCRAFT
WE MAY SEE THEM LATER ON IN THE SHOW
TO ASK THAT ALL IMPORTANT QUESTION
GRAHAM WHITE WAS A VISIONARY
SO MUCH SO THAT HIS SITE WAS COMMENTED BY THE ADMIRALTY FOR TRAINING DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR
WHITE HIMSELF FLEW RECONNAISSANCE MISSIONS
THIS IS WHERE THEIR JOURNEY STARTS
AT THE VALUATION DAY
THE LUCKY ONES GO THROUGH TO THE AUCTION ROOM
WE JUST NEED TO FIND THEM
I LOVE THE BLUE
READY TO TAKE OFF
WE HAVE NOW FOUND OUR FIRST THREE ITEMS TO GO TO AUCTION
YOU HAD SOME QUALITY
YOU BROUGHT IT IN
IT'S RELATIVELY EASY HERE AT GROUND LEVEL
EXPENDING ALL THEIR AMMUNITION
THE ROYAL NAVAL FLYING SERVICE AND THE ROYAL AIR CORPS MERGED TO BECOME THE WORLD'S FIRST
IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE IN BRITAIN'S AVIATION HISTORY
THANKS IN PART TO THE YOUNG FLYING PIONEERS
THEIR ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT
HE WAS FLYING AN AIRCRAFT SIMILAR TO THIS ONE
PILOTS WERE TOO
WHEN I GOT OLDER
MY FATHER IS NOT ALIVE
I ASKED MY CHILDREN
THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH
AH PRINCE CHARLES AND PRINCESS ANNE IN VIP SOUNDPROOFED CABINS
I JUST WISH WE COULD FLY THAT TO THE AUCTION ROOMS
THE CROWDS HAVE CERTAINLY DONE US PROUD HERE TODAY
WE'VE HAD A MAGNIFICENT TIME BUT
ONLY ONE OF TWO WESSEX HELICOPTERS THAT TRANSPORTED THE ROYAL FAMILY AROUND
INTRODUCED INTO SERVICE IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE
RIGHT UP UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT
IT'S ALL OVER FOR OUR OWNERS
WE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED BEING IN LONDON AND I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED WATCHING THE SHOW
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST US BEFORE THEN
BIG BROTHER JACK
SHE SAID TO ME SHE'D CARRY THOSE BOYS TO THE END OF THE EARTH
SHE WANTS TO DO THAT BUT
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'LL END UP AND
WHICH MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST WAY
DON'T TELL ANYBODY THAT
SO MANY THINGS THAT I COULDN'T HAVE EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT OR DREAMT ABOUT
IT'S JUST PHENOMENAL
VERY GOOD RIGHT NOW
SO THEY WERE OUTSIDE THE NORMAL REGULATORY STRUCTURE
AND SO THEY HADN'T EVEN BOTHERED TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND TALK TO EACH OTHER
AND IN THE WRONG PLACES
AND THEY'RE VERY INEFFICIENT
AND ACTUALLY HAVE TO KEEP BORROWING MONEY NOW TO PAY INTEREST IN PRINCIPLE ON THE LOANS THEY
WOULD BE NECESSARY
WHICH IS TO INVEST IN BETTER
AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR A LOT OF THE TRADING COUNTRIES OF EUROPE
WHETHER IT'S GERMANY
THAT ECONOMY IS GROWING
AND DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF ECONOMIC FIREPOWER THAT THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES CAN THROW AT
IT'S CREATING JOBS
I WANT BRITAIN TO BE PART OF IT
AND I THINK IF WE CUT OURSELVES OFF FROM CHINA
STRONGEST BOOM OF ANY IMPORTANT COUNTRY IN HISTORY
BUT WHAT GOES UP INEVITABLY COMES DOWN
THE SOONER ITS DEBTS STOP INCREASING IN A DANGEROUS WAY
I HAVE SEEN IT WITH SOME PATIENTS
AT THE MILL HEALTH CENTRE
SO YOU HAVE A LONGER WALK TO WORK
AH FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY
NOT FOOD IN GENERAL
WHO IS INDISPUTABLY THE QUEEN OF IRISH COOKING
FAMOUS IN BEVERLY HILLS
AND SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT
BUT BEFORE WE GO INTO ALL OF THAT
WE GOT TO CHATTING AND AS USUAL
THAT GOES IN THE OVEN FOR
MAYBE THERE WOULD BE
I KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE
BETWEEN HIM AND PEARL
YOU'RE MY TOTAL PRIORITIES
AND I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO
YOUR BRAINS AND MY LOOKS
THANKS TO THE DRY
DEAL OR NO DEAL DAVID CAMERON SAYS HE'S BATTLING FOR BRITAIN AT A CRUCIAL MEETING IN BRUSSELS
HE WANTS EUROPE'S OTHER LEADERS TO BACK CHANGES HE WANTS
FOURTEEN CANCER PATIENTS HAVE CAUGHT SWINE FLU AT A HOSPITAL IN LEICESTER
I CAN'T PREVENT SOMEONE FROM MOVING UP THE PROMOTIONAL LADDER
HE'S AT MY HOUSE
WHATEVER THAT IS
ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND
AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE
HE'S MY SON HE'S MY RESPONSIBILITY
YOU SAID YOURSELF
BUT I THINK YOU'RE DANGEROUS
DRUGS AND WE'VE GOT GUILT
AND NOW WE'VE GOT BLAME
THAT'S A FANTASTIC COMBINATION
BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T NEED IT
WHEN FISH AND CHIPS FIRST APPEARED
CRAB COMES IN TWO PARTS
IT'S NOT A LIVELIHOOD WHERE
WHICH ALSO HOUSES THE FAMOUS BURRELL COLLECTION
IS ONLY THREE MILES FROM THE CITY CENTRE OF GLASGOW
THAT WAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE
MY UNCLE BOUGHT THAT FOR ME
WHERE SHE GOT IT FROM
THEY'VE COME TO SEE ME BAT
ITALIAN AND DUTCH
A RATHER DIFFERENT
AND AT THE TIME
AND AS A RESULT
THE HOUSE BOASTED THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF SPANISH ART IN BRITAIN
THE MOST IMPORTANT ROYAL FAMILY IN EUROPE
ARE A CONSTANT FEATURE IN SIR WILLIAM'S COLLECTION
WHY HE LOOKED LIKE THAT
I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A VERY SPECIAL COLLECTION
WHO WAS THE ARTIST
HE WASN'T JUST ADVISED BY AN ART ADVISOR
AND WHEN HE TOOK A TRIP TO SPAIN
VERY MUCH FAMILY LINKS
BUT THEY WERE NEVER INTENDED TO BE HUNG ON THE WALLS
I WOULD SUGGEST IT'S BEEN SLIGHTLY CUT DOWN
WE'RE SERVING UP A VICTORIAN SILVER TRAY IN THE GEORGIAN STYLE
AND I LIKE THIS
BUT WE'VE HAD SOME GREAT RESULTS IN AUCTION ROOMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WE'VE SEEN SOME WONDERFUL
IT'S BEEN A REAL PRIVILEGE
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THE SHOW
AND THEN TWO MINUTES AS USUAL FOR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
BECAUSE THIS IS A SEMIFINAL
EACH OF THEM CAN CONGRATULATE THEMSELVES ON GETTING THROUGH THE HEATS
THANKS FOR WATCHING
IN THIS NIGHTMARE
THE ONE THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WITH
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO DOWN
YOU GO DOWN SWINGING
BUT THE DOCTOR SAID
I CAN ONLY APOLOGIZE
PACKAGE ALL TO SPAIN
YOU REALLY ARE DOING MOST AWFULLY WELL
THEY DON'T LIKE IT
IF YOUR HAIR WAS A BIT GREYER
IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER
IF YOU CARED ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR KID
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY
LOTS TO LOOK FORWARD TO THERE
BUT WE'RE STARTING WITH A REAL TREAT
THEY HAVE A BORDER
IT'S LIKE A BARCODE IN A SUPERMARKET
LOOK OUT FOR THE QR CODES
WHY DOES ONE GET A GOLD AND ONE NOT QUITE
THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE THE OLYMPIC ATHLETES OF THE GARDENING WORLD
IT IS HIS FIRST CHELSEA GARDEN AND I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW RARE THAT IS
IN VICTORIAN TIMES
THAT IT WAS A STAGNANT SHALLOW
AND TOWN GARDENS DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF GARDENS THAT YOU WOULD GET IN THE COUNTRY
AND THE PLANTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST SPECIAL
AND WITH THAT WE'VE REACHED THE END OF TODAY'S PROGRAMME
WHEN I GOT THE CALL TO SAY THAT HE'D DROPPED DEAD FROM A CARDIAC ARREST
SHA'S HEART CONDITION WAS PICKED UP BECAUSE OF THE TRAGIC DEATH OF HER BROTHER
IT'S THE ONLY CHARITY DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO SUPPORTING FAMILIES FOLLOWING A SUDDEN CARDIAC
I WOULDN'T WISH WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH ON ANYONE
IT'S VITAL TO TO SAVE LIGHT
THOUSAND YOUNG PEOPLE WERE SCREENED BY CRY
IT'S A COMPLETELY FREE SERVICE THAT NO ONE ELSE OFFERS
AND HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW WE'LL GET ALL OF THOSE THROUGH
WE HAD A POWER CUT
BUT COULD AN ANCIENT SOIL TREATMENT GIVE US THE CHANCE TO FIGHT BACK
BUT THE TRULY DEVASTATING THING ABOUT ASH DIEBACK OR CALARA
THE FIRST PAPER WAS PUBLISHED
IT'S A WORLD FIRST
AND SO I WASN'T REALLY GETTING TOO EXCITED
IS IS GOING TO RESULT IN IN STIMULATION OF ROOT GROWTH
SO THE TREE IS IS GOING TO BECOME HEALTHIER AND
IN TERMS OF PUBLISHED PAPERS
BECAUSE THEY'RE MADE FROM DIFFERENT PRODUCTS YOU'RE MADE SO
SOME ARE MADE FROM WOOD CHIPS
SIMPLY BY ADDING BIOCHAR TO THE SOIL
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE'VE GOT REALLY GOOD EVIDENCE FOR WHAT WORKS SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE
AND IT REALLY DOES NOT EXIST
INTENSIFICATION OF FARMING
THERE'S NO SQUIRREL BEEN IN THERE OVER THE WINTER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
WHICH ARE FAR MORE VALUABLE
A LITTLE BIT OF A THREE POINT TURN WITH THE TRAILER
WE ARE GOING TO BE IN ETHICS
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY THAT KAREN DID THEM
WOULD YOU CALL ME BACK
EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT
THAT ALL GOES WELL AS A PACKAGE
WE REALLY DO HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT
SIT BACK AND ENJOY AS THE STORIES UNFOLD
LET'S MAKE A START
THIS IS THE THE HEIGHT OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE
WE CONTROLLED THE WHOLE WORLD
EVERYTHING WE HAD
ARE YOU INTO WINES
I SUPPOSE I COULD CHANCE MY ARM
MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WILL MAKE IT TO THE AUCTION ROOM WITH THEIR ITEM
GIVING THE ON SCREEN EXPERTS THE INFORMATION
THAT'S OUR FIRST VISIT TO THE AUCTION ROOM DONE AND DUSTED TODAY AND SOME HAPPY OWNERS THAT'S THE
TAKING CARE OF THEM
TECHNIQUES HAVE CHANGED OVER THE
WHAT WAS ACCEPTABLE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN THIS MUSEUM FIRST OPENED IS NOW
AND I'VE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED LOOKING AT THESE AND
AND THAT'S THANKS TO THE DILIGENT
HARD WORKING CONSERVATION TEAM
THE FUTURE OF FINE ART IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND LOOKS ROSY HERE AT THE BOWES
IT'S REALLY HARD TO STOP AND FOCUS ON ONE THERE'S SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM
IS THIS PAINTING BY VAN DYCK
IT'S ALL OVER FOR OUR OWNERS
AND WE'VE PUT THOSE VALUATIONS TO THE TEST
IT HAS BEEN A ROLLERCOASTER RIDE FOR EVERYBODY CONCERNED EVEN OUR EXPERTS BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN EXACT
I HAVE ENJOYED THE SHOW
JOIN US AGAIN FOR MANY MORE SURPRISES NEXT TIME
WILL THEY SUCCUMB TO THE SINS OF ENVY
TO GET MORE EXPERIENCE
JUST TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WORK IN EUROPE AND TO SORT OF TRAVEL MORE AROUND EUROPE
I WATCHED JURASSIC PARK ON TV AND I THOUGHT
DON'T STAND THERE AND GO
IT HAS THE LEVEL GUIDES IN IT
WE SURVIVED THE SHOP
THE HOUR IS NOW UP
BUT HERE'S A PRIME EXAMPLE
WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THEY NEED DEPEND BUY OR NOT SO
WHICH IS LOVELY
THAT'S MINUS TWENTY FIVE
IT COULD BE A WINNING SCORE
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
BUT I PROMISE YOU
YOU'RE NOT DOING NOTHING
YOU'RE GETTING STRONGER
I THINK SHE'S HAVING A REALLY ROUGH TIME AT THE MOMENT
SO WHAT'S IN TODAY'S SHOW
IT'S A TRICKY ONE
POUND IT'S NOT REST IN PEACE
YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE
I THINK YOU WERE AN ACTUAL SAINT
LET'S CATCH UP LATER
I WAS JUST WORRIED
HOW'S THE CANCER
NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS
MY LITTLE FRESH JU MARKET
BECAUSE I EAT THEM ALL ON THE WAY HOME
WHEN I HEAR SOMEBODY DOING THAT
WHICH WAS ONCE HOME TO ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST FAMOUS SCIENTISTS THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY NEVER HEARD OF
LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
OFTEN IT ISN'T STAMPED
NOT FAR FROM THIS SALEROOM THERE THE PRETTY
RURAL VILLAGE OF SELBORNE
IT HAS A VILLAGE SHOP
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S ALL FOR AND HOW IT'S USED
A LOT OF THINGS
BUT SAMPLERS IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS I HAVE SEEN
THEY HAVE RISEN QUITE STEEPLY
FROM POISONING OF ALL THE ITEMS
AND THEN I START TO LOOK
GIVES YOU SOMETHING TO GET YOUR OLD TEETH INTO
THAT WAS MY FAVOURITE
I THOUGHT I'D MAKE IT LOOK NICE
IT'S AFTER A PIECE OF PLASTIC WAS FOUND IN ONE OF THEM
SHE IS IN A STABLE CONDITION
ONE PERSON HAS DIED IN AN EXPLOSION AT DIDCOT POWER STATION IN OXFORDSHIRE
THE FIRE SERVICE SAYS THREE OTHERS ARE MISSING
JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND ARE TO GO ON STRIKE AGAIN
THERE WILL BE THREE MORE FORTY EIGHT HOUR WALKOUTS IN A DISPUTE OVER THEIR CONTRACTS
MARS IS RECALLING MILLIONS OF CHOCOLATE BARS
THEY INCLUDE MARS AND SNICKERS
PUT THE PIN IN AND PUT THE STICKER ON WITH A PIN
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
SHE ALWAYS RINGS
YASMIN IS MARRIED NOW
HIGHLIGHTED THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS A CASE WOULD HAVE
ON THE PRACTICE
TO MAKE THINGS REALLY AUTHENTIC
AND PEOPLE ARE SO BORED WITH IT
WHETHER IT'S A TOR PIE OR A GAME PIE
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
THERE WAS A BIT OF A PROBLEM
LET'S HOPE IT DOES REALLY
I CAN'T GET JOB NOW BECAUSE OF IT
WHEN PEOPLE SEE IT
THERE'S BEEN GIRLS AND
IT'S RUINING MY LIFE
IF THAT'S NOT SIGNIFICANT DISTRESS
IT CAUSES DISTRESS FOR ME
IT CAUSES DISTRESS FOR OTHER PEOPLE
BECAUSE I'VE GOT CANCER
IF I DON'T THINK HE'S THE GOVERNMENT
I'M STILL IN TOUCH WITH MATES FROM
IN BETWEEN EACH ONE
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
THERE IS COMMISSION TO PAY
WE LOVE THE COLLECTORS
AND I TELL YOU WHAT
BELIEVED TO BE SOME OF THE MOST DURABLE AND DESIRABLE IN THE WORLD
SO EARLIER IN THE WEEK
AND WE ALL KNOW CORNMAN IS FAMOUS FOR ITS TIN AND ITS COPPER MINES
WHICH IS SEVENTEEN MILES FROM DELABOLE
YOU RAISING CHILDREN AND KEEPING THE HOUSEHOLD GOING WHEN WHEN THE MEN WERE ACTUALLY ABROAD
TOP END OF THE ESTIMATE
JOIN US AGAIN FOR MANY MORE SURPRISES BUT
I NEED YOUR HELP
YOU AND VALERIE
I PREFER THE SHOWS
IT WAS THAT MOMENT THAT YOU REALISE THAT THEY'VE MADE STARBUCK A WOMAN
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK
I DON'T MIND IT ACTUALLY WRAPPED IN FILO PASTRY
NEARLY EVERYTHING IN THERE
CAN YOU PASS ME AN EGG OVER THERE
WE TAKE AWAY ALL THE GOODNESS
FIVE CONTENDERS INSTEAD OF THE USUAL FOUR
BECAUSE THIS IS A SEMIFINAL
THE OTHER DIFFERENCE IS THAT THERE IS A MINUTE AND A HALF FOR THE SPECIALIST SUBJECTS AND TWO
YOU'RE A MONSTER
AND FOUR HAVE ENDED UP WITH DUST
THAT'S RIGHT YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND FRIENDSHIP
BRITAIN'S FAVORITE FLOWER
AND JUDGING BY WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE
SOME OF THESE SHAKESPEARE KNEW
WHEN HERRICK SAID
BUT THEN THEY ARE FOLLOWED BY HIPS
AND THEN WE'VE GOT A GOOD FRAMEWORK
WHICH WE CAN TIE THEM INTO
SO THESE CANES HERE WILL NOT PRODUCE NEXT YEAR'S RASPBERRIES
WE WON'T BE GETTING ANY RASPBERRIES FROM THESE NEXT SUMMER
WITH SUCH SHALLOW
BUT I FIND THIS NEXT PIECE FASCINATING
PARTICULARLY WITH PATIO ROSES
IS THEY LIKE TO BE PRUNED HARD
SO YOU CAN REALLY GO IN THERE WITH THE SECAURS AND CUT THEM RIGHT BACK
RHODODENDRONS AND HOW TO BUILD RAISED BEDS
AND THAT AFFECTS THE PRUNING REGIME
WHEN IT' IS TIME FOR PRUNING
I JUST WANT TO PLANT THEM
WHAT TYPE OF RASPBERRY IT IS
PLANTING IS EXACTLY THE SAME
AFTER THAT DIY LESSON
AND THOSE ARE THE ONES YOU
AND IF THAT'S NOT A NICE WAY TO END OUR LOOK AT THE LETTER R
YOU CAN SEE AS THE BALL WAS RUNNING DOWN
THEY NEED A LOT OF TIME
WHEREAS WITH ADULTS
THEY ALREADY HAVE THIS
AND I'D LIKE TO
THAT'S QUITE PLEASANT
AS I KNOW MYSELF
A WORKING DOG IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF LIVESTOCK FARMING
AS TOM HAS BEEN FINDING OUT
IF A PET DOG GETS LOOSE ON A FARM
THE RESULTS CAN BE DISASTROUS
IT'S JUST SUCH A SUCCESS STORY IN ESSEX
BECAUSE ALL OF OUR MAIN RIVERS HAVE LOST THEIR WATER VOLES NOW
BUT WE KNOW THAT THE SORT OF PERCENTAGE OF THE HABITAT THAT'S BEING USED NOW IS MUCH MORE THAN IT
THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY
GIVEN THE CHANCE
ONCE A DOG HAS ATTACKED
WE'RE ALSO ASKING FARMERS
AND FROM SMALLHOLDERS
SOME POCKETS WERE DOING REALLY WELL
AND SOME POCKETS WERE DOING NOT SO WELL
AND THE LAMBS ARE IN A WATER BAG
AND THE CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE REALLY DISAPPOINTED
THERE'S THIS HUGE INCREASE IN NUMBERS
AND ANITA WILL BE EXPLORING THE BEAUTY OF THE ULSTER WAY
I'M FEELING RATHER CHILLY
SO STAY WITH US
I THINK THAT ONE WAS A LITTLE BIT
OUR FIRST LOTS DONE AND DUSTED UNDER THE HAMMER
WE ARE COMING BACK HERE LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME
WE COULD HAVE THAT BIG SURPRISE I PROMISED YOU
SERVANTS NEVER GOT PAINTED
AND AND HE WAS A SERVANT
WHICH I THINK SUGGESTS A LITTLE BIT WHAT A CHARACTER WAS LIKE
THE CLOWN DOESN'T KNOW THAT THE CLOWN IS STUPID
AND THAT'S WHY THE CLOWN IS FUNNY
SO LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
UM BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE
SO IT'S TIME FOR US TO SAY FAREWELL TO MUNCASTER CASTLE
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
AH SO THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT SOME OF LAST NIGHT'S TELLY
WE THOUGHT WE'D GET HIM TO WHIP OUT HIS SELFIE STICK AND RECORD A VIDEO DIARY COVER IT COVERING ALL OF THE
SO HAVE A LOOK AT THIS
WELCOME TO FOOTBALL FOCUS
THIS HAS BEEN MY LOVELY CHAIR FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS BUT
BEFORE THAT ON NEWS TWENTY FOUR AS WAS
WHETHER IT'S IN THE KITCHEN
AND EVERYONE WAS CRYING THEIR EYES OUT ON THE VOICE
BESIDES WHAT HE IS
AND EVERYWHERE THESE GUYS GO
BASED ON THE FACT THAT I HAVEVE WORKED WITH HUGH FOR LONGER
WITH AN ICE COLD DRINK
YOU KNOW I LOVE BILLY
YOU SAID YOU MADE A MISTAKE
YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH
NONE OF US ARE THE SAME
BUT YOU CAN'T PUSH HIM INTO BEING SOMETHING THAT HE'S NOT
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING
I SET UP A YOUNG PERSONS WEBSITE HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE GET INTO JOBS
AND THE TIME WILL DISAPPEAR
FIVE MINUTES DOWNSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT THERE IS DOWN THERE AND THEN WE'LL SPEND THE LAST FIVE MINUTES
WE'VE GOT A HINGED DOWN SURFACE HERE THAT CONTAINS A LADY'S DRESSING MIRROR
ON THAT HAPPY NOTE
I RESPECT YOUR VIEW
RIGHT NOW LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT BRAXTON'S COMPACT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG
BY INVESTING IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES
AND AS WE'RE IN THE AREA
AND I THINK I NEED A BIT OF A BREAK AND WHAT BETTER PLACE TO RELAX THAN LOOKING AT THE WAVES AND
DID YOU KNOW THE BRITISH INVENTED THE SEASIDE HOLIDAY
WESTERN'S VICTORIAN ENTREPRENEURS WERE KEEN TO DRAW IN THE VISITORS
TO CAPITALISE ON THIS POTENTIAL NEW SOURCE OF INCOME
THEY BOUGHT A POSTCARD AND SENT IT TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS BACK AT HOME
TO FIND OUT MORE
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE SMELL AND THE SOUND OF THE WAVES THAT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER
THEY HAD MORE LEISURE
THEY OFFERED A DIFFERENT KIND OF BREAK
WITH EVERYTHING THROWN IN FROM ACCOMMODATION TO FOOD AND ENTERTAINMENT
THEY BECAME THE DESTINATION
WHO OPENED THE FIRST CAMPS AROUND THE COAST
THAT WAS A REBOUND
JUST REMIND THEM
UM THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT NOW
SO IT'S IT'S A PIECE OF HISTORY
VERY DECORATIVE AND SCULPTURAL QUALITIES BUT
WE'VE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED OURSELVES
WE FOUND SOME WONDERFUL TREASURES AND WE'VE HAD SOME CLASSIC SEASIDE ENTERTAINMENT
THAT'S A GOOD RESULT
THE JOKE IS ON US
THIS IS WHAT WEVE NOTICED
THE REMAINING CONTENDERS TOOK ON THE TRANSFORMATION OF A COSY COTTAGE SITTING ROOM AND
NEXT UP IT'S BACK IN TIME FOR THE WEEKEND
WHEN WE WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT DOING A SECOND SERIES OF WE THOUGHT WE COULD GO FURTHER BACK TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY BUT
IT SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY
WED ALREADY COVERED ALL THE FOODS WE THOUGHT WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO
MU BASICALLY CLEANING ALL DAY KIDS RUNNING AROUND OUTSIDE
THE BOY FINALLY GETS SOME PROPER VIDEO GAMES
SEGA NINTENDO
BACK IN TIME FOR THE WEEKEND
MARY TAYLOR GOT A TAD TIPSY ON CORRIE BUT BEFORE THAT ON ITV WE SAW
IF YOU THOUGHT NOTHING MUCH HAPPENED IN NORTHUMBERLAND
WHATS YOUR NAME
SO TEACHING YOUR PARTNER
CRACKING NIGHT ON TELL TONIGHT
CHANNEL FOUR THERES THE SECRET LIFE OF THE ZOO
IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE
NO ITS A SERIES SET IN GLORIOUS BOLTON IN A SCRAP YARD AND TONIGHT BOSS MAN TERRY STRUGGLES
RECENTLY I HAD A CAFE
WHICH I'VE SOLD AND
PREVIOUS TO THAT
I NEED TO MARK KAREN
KAREN WILL BE THINKING
BUT THERE'S NOT A
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO TURN UP AND DO A SALES PITCH
SO THERE'S NOTHING IN THEM
I DON'T THINK I WAS WRONG IN SAYING THAT
TALKING SOMEONE DOWN
WHATVE WILLIAM
I'M TELLING YOU
THEN AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS
DO YOU EVER SWITCH OFF
THE ONLY PERSON WHO'S SHOWN ANY COMPETENCE IN IN DELIVERING THAT IS KAREN
I WANT CONFIDENCE AND I WANT FACTS
SOMETHING TO NAIL
AND WITH ALL THESE CERAMICS ABOUT
FAST CARS ZIPPING UP AND DOWN
THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE IN STAFFORD
WHAT A LOVELY WAY TO START THE DAY THIS IS
ON THAT HAPPY NOTE
PHYSICALLY I'M ALL RIGHT
ONLY ONE CLIENT TODAY
WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO IS MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH WAY YOU THINK THE PRICE OF THE
YOU GOT LUCKY YESTERDAY
THOUSAND POUNDS AND YOU'VE ALREADY WON TWO
THAT'S BECAUSE THE MARKET THIS MORNING WAS A BIT BULLISH
BUT HE SAID HE WANTED TO WAIT
AS WE ASK THAT ALL IMPORTANT QUESTION
MUSICAL BOXES AND MECHANICAL MUSIC
AND AS SOON AS I STARTED
WITHIN TEN LOTS
AS A YOUNG GIRL
VERY RARELY DOES A SHOW PASS WITHOUT AN EXAMPLE COMING ACROSS
BURN WAS ELDERLY LADY
HAVE A LOOK AT IT
A CONCEPT THAT EXCITED A VICTORIAN AUDIENCE
BUT WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THIS BEAUTIFUL CITY THAT INSPIRED HIM TO WRITE SUCH A SINISTER STORY
HE RAIDED HIS CLIENTS' HOUSES TO FUND HIS GAMBLING HABIT
WHAT WE PRESENT TO THE WORLD AND WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON INSIDE OUR HEADS
THE TWO SIDES OF HUMAN NATURE
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT
SO HOW NOTORIOUS WERE HIS POEMS
THIS ONE TOWARDS MUCH
THAT'S A GOOD RESULT
IF YOU HAVEN'T QUITE MADE YOUR MIND UP WHO YOU'RE ROOTING FOR IN THE FINAL
I THINK WE'VE HAD
THE GREAT BRITISH SEWING BEE
GREAT BRITISH HOLIDAY
GREAT BRITISH BENEFITS HANDOUT
THE GREAT POTTERY THROWDOWN
AND IT WAS SO INTENSE LAST NIGHT
ON LAST NIGHT'S EPISODE
WE'RE GOING BACK
IF YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING BBC ONE
FIFTY FIVE THAT EVENING
IT WAS SET IN NEWCASTLE AND FOLLOWED CANNY FACTORY WORKERS TERRY AND BOB AND THEY CHATTED UP GIRLS
ONLY EIGHT HAVE SURVIVED
BUT IS ON CHANNEL FOUR
AND IN THIS CLIP
SOMEONE'S FINGERNAIL IS LOOKING A LITTLE WORSE FOR WEAR
AND FILM TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY FOR TWENTY EIGHT DAYS IN THE A AND E DEPARTMENT
EARLIER WE SAID YOU'D SEE MORE OF JAMES NORTON
AND THIS TIME AROUND
IN HONOUR OF ITS CREATOR TONY WARREN
WHO SADLY PASSED AWAY TODAY
MORE FACES WILL BE ADDED TO THIS BOARD
HE IS CURRENTLY IN SOUTH AFRICA ATTEMPTING
TWENTY SEVEN MARATHONS IN TWENTY SEVEN DAYS
ALL IN AID OF SPORT RELIEF
AH YOU CAN SEE HOW HE'S MANAGING EVERY DAY ON BBC THREE
AH LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE MARATHON MAN
WHAT AN AMAZING MAN
IT WASN'T A SLIPPY FLOOR THAT BROUGHT US TOGETHER
I WAS ACTUALLY QUITE BUSY DEALING WITH MY CANCER
CHEMO IS A PAINFUL MEDICAL PROCEDURE
I'M SICK OF PEOPLE GALPING AT ME
WILL SHE PASS OUT
NOT HAVING ANY EXPERIENCE OF LOVE AND ROMANCE
NIGEL GAVE IT TO ME
IT WAS ALWAYS MY NICKNAME
I SUDDENLY FIND MYSELF YOUNG
SITUATED AROUND THIRTY MILES SOUTH OF GLASGOW
THE CONTENTS AND THE HOUSE WERE SAVED FOR THE NATION
FOR US TO ENJOY TODAY
HEADED UP BY THE PRINCE OF WALES
THEY RAPIDLY UNDERTAKEN A SCHEDULE OF REGENERATION WORKS
AND THEY ACHIEVED IT JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME
WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS
LET'S GET THE RESERVE RIGHT
WHEN THE TRUST TOOK OVER THE HOUSE
THERE WERE CLUES THAT SOMETHING MORE EXHILARATING LAY BENEATH
SHE'S ON HOLIDAY
GOING UNDER THE HAMMER
WE HAVE A BOXED
COUNTRY HOUSES THAT HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SAVED FOR THE NATION TO ENJOY
NOT FAR FROM HERE
THIRTY MILES AWAY IN GLASGOW
THESE WALLS TELL A STORY OF A DIFFERENT TYPE OF CONSERVATION
TO UNDERSTAND THAT
BUT HERE YOU CAN SEE THOMPSON HAS DEFINITELY BROKE THE RULES
AT THE INCREDIBLY YOUNG AGE OF TWELVE
HE WAS NICKNAMED GREEK BECAUSE HE WAS AN EXPONENT OF THE GREEK REVIVAL MOVEMENT
GREEK VILLAS USUALLY ARE SYMMETRICAL
ESPECIALLY AMONGST THE NEWLY FOUNDED ALEXANDER THOMSON SOCIETY
GLASGOW CITY COUNCIL STEPPED IN
THEY REFUSED THE PLANNING COMMISSION
IT WAS RUN AS A SCHOOL
THIS CAUSED WIDESPREAD CONCERN
FOR GOODNESS' SAKE
BY THE CHRISTMAS
THE FAMILY BEDROOM
THAT'S STUFFED WITH FEATHERS
I THINK IT'LL SAIL THROUGH THAT
YOU'VE SHOWN US SOME WONDERFUL TREASURES FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WE'VE HAD SOME FANTASTIC
ESPECIALLY THOSE THREE BISHEADED PORCELAIN DOLLS
THEY DEFINITELY DID THE BUSINESS AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
AND I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED EXPLORING THE GROUNDBREAKING RESTORATION WORK THAT'S HAPPENED HERE AT DUMFRIES
IT LOOKS FABULOUS AND I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THE SHOW
UNTIL THE NEXT TIME
WITH WAS A DANGER TO US SO
THERE ARE MANY UNSOLVED MYSTERIES IN THE WORLD OF TV
THEN GET IN TOUCH
AND YOU NEVER KNOW
AND IT'S VERY FUNNY

CURIOSITY ABOUT AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE

WORLD CLASS CONCERT VENUES
WITH DISCRETION ON THE SIX HUNDRED
THE LIST IS ENDLESS
THEY ALL COME FROM THIS AREA
THEY HAVE LEFT FIVE HUNDRED
CAN WE RECYCLE IT
WHICH EVERYBODY WANTS
AH YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID
THE GETAWAY CHASE
AS HIS LINE MANAGER
BUT YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO KEEP IT FROM ME IN THE FIRST PLACE
THERE WILL BE A LITTLE BIT OF TRAUMA INVOLVED
I THINK YOU WILL
I HOPE HE DOESN'T FALL
GET THINGS WRONG AND IT COULD END UP IN A SERIOUS INJURY AND
BEING A VET WHO WORKS WITH HORSES IS NOW RECOGNISED AS HAVING THE HIGHEST RISK OF INJURY
TO COMPARE TO A DIFFERENT INDUSTRY
AND A COUPLE OF THE CHAPS ACTUALLY WALKED OFF THE FARM AND SAID
WE ARE IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT
WE ROCK MY ANIMALS
WHO ARE DRAWN TO THIS DRAMATIC LANDSCAPE
BUT IF YOU ARE A FAN OF GAME OF THRONES
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT LANDOWNERS ON THE ROUTE
MANY OTHER PATHS
THERE WAS FIVE BORN IN THE ONE YEAR
AND THAT WAS A REAL RECORD FOR THE ISLAND
SO MYSELF AND MY HUSBAND STEPHEN
WE WERE READY FOR A CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE
WHICH IS FULL OF ENERGY AND PROTEIN
AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO DIE
WE'RE A BIT MORE TEMPERAMENTAL
SO WHAT'S IN STORE FOR US IN THE WEEK AHEAD
IN THE SUMMERTIME
FINDING OUT WHAT LIFE IS LIKE FOR A YOUNG FARMER
IT'S PRETTY UNPLEASANT
I THOUGHT WE GOT ON OK
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH HER
BUT SHE'S GOT A RECORD
I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING
BUT IT MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO PUSH HER INTO ADMITTING IT
I DON'T MEAN TO BE UNCHARITABLE
I HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING WITH GINA'S NAME OR ADDRESS ON IT
I'M GOING TO THE SUPERMARKET
WE ARE AT THE BOWES MUSEUM IN COUNTY DURHAM
THEY'VE BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR
THEIR VERY OWN TREASURES FOR OUR EXPERTS TO SEE AND DELVE DEEP INTO THESE BAGS TO REVEAL THOSE
A WONDERFUL PIECE OF HISTORY AND A WONDERFUL SURVIVOR
SO LET'S GET STARTED
I HAVE TO COMMEND YOU BOTH FOR BRINGING IN WHAT IS NOT ONLY
I THINK THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN BOTH
EARLIER ON IN THE WEEK
THAT'S WHAT THE SALORS ALL ABOUT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
SIT BACK AND ENJOY THIS ROLLER COASTER RIDE AS WE PUT THEM TO THE TEST
THE REASONS ARE QUITE COMPLEX BUT
WE HAVE TO VISIT THE SITE OF THE BATTLE ITSELF
THE MOST FAMOUS
AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THAT A HORSE FROM THE NORTH HAD WON A BIG RACE DOWN SOUTH
AND THAT TOOK PLACE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE
IT WAS A WONDERFUL HORSE RACING ACHIEVEMENT
THEY'RE LOOKING AT A WINNER
WHEN THEY CAME TO ME
LET'S HOPE FOR THAT
BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THEY DID
A MARTIAL SPORT
WE'VE ALL LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT ART AND HISTORY AND THAT'S THE MAIN THING
IT'S THE OLDEST IN THE SALEROOM AS WELL
I'M REALLY HAPPY
AND WE HAVE A GOLD MILITARY FOR MEDALLION BELONGING TO CHRISTINA
ALSO ON AT NINE PM ON SKY ATLANTIC
ITS FUNKY AND YOU GET GREAT MUSIC
WE'VE GOT MORE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU LATER ON IN THE SHOW
EVERY TIME A CHARACTER WAS BUMPED OFF AND AND DIED IN THE SCRIPT
I AM DOING A FILM WITH JACKIE CHAN
IT WAS HOSTED BY ESTHER RANSON AND WE THINK IT WAS A TV TRAILBLAZER
IT ALSO FOLLOWS THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THE FARMERS' PERSONAL LIFE
HE CAN'T HELP IT IT' LIKE
THANK YOU AND WELCOME
WELL WONDER NO LONGER
IT'S THE MOST UNLIKELY JAILBIRD IN TV HISTORY IT'S DEIRRE SWAPPING NUMBER SEVEN
TONIGHT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE GIRLS AS THEY GO THROUGH THEIR PHYSICAL TRAINING
THEN THERE'LL JUST BE ARGUMENTS
I NEED THE MONEY
TOOK THE BINS OUT
YOU'VE GOT MY NUMBER
IF SHE WANTS YOU TO KNOW
MY GRANDMOTHER BLEACHED HERS EVERY NIGHT AND SO WILL I
LIVING WITH SOMEONE ELSE
EVEN MY VALERIE
THERE ARE SOME THINGS I WON'T COMPROMISE ON
WHEN YOU FELL OVER
SHE'S THE NEWEST ARRIVAL ON ONE OF TV'S LONGEST RUNNING MEDICAL DRAMAS
WHERE SHE WAS TEACHING MEDICS
SHE IS AN ARMY MEDIC
REALLY INTERESTING CHARACTER
AND IT'S NOT HER THING
SOME WOULD SAY ARROGANT
BUT SHE IS WARM
I HAVEN'T BEEN INTO HOSPITAL TO WATCH AN OPERATION BUT
IMAGINE YOU ARE JUST PUTTING TOGETHER TWO PORCELAIN PLATES
THEY HAD A REALLY GOOD IDEA ABOUT THE CHARACTER
IF YOU ARE SAT THERE ENJOYING YOUR TEA
AS WELL AS ISSUES MOST OF US WILL NEVER HAVE TO FACE
IN THIS CLIP FROM TONIGHT'S EPISODE
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY A GREAT BUNCH OF TEENAGERS
THIS IS THE SECOND SERIES
WHO'S GOT THE GIRLS IN THE OFFICE A BIT HOT UNDER THE COLLAR
HAVE EVERYBODY THERE IN CASE
NOW THE IDEA IS TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO SOMETHING SAFELY
HOW THINGS MAY NOT QUITE RIGHT
AND I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT AFTER TWENTY TWO YEARS OF ALAN ON OUR SCREENS
ALIENS NOW LIVE ON THE EARTH IN A CITY CALLED TROY
BORDER SECURITY GUARD LEWIS
LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER
YOU'RE MOVING BEYOND FIRST IMPRESSIONS
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET
AS YOU GO THROUGH THE PROCESS
DEEP LOOK AT THE CANDIDATE'S PERSONALITY
NOT THE WORK THEY'VE DONE IN THE PAST OR WHERE THEY'VE WORKED OR WHO THEY WORKED WITH
DO THEY HAVE THAT SORT OF TOPLINE SKILL SET
ARE THEY ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WELL
DEAL WITH TEAMS
MANAGE DOWN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND
SO WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS
THERE BEING THEIR REAL SELF THROUGH ALL THE TESTS
RUSS SEEMED MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT THE BEER
A PLANE FULL OF JELLY BEANS
WHY YOU GOT THOSE THINGS
SO BEFORE IT GOT TO THE STAGE OF VOTING AND ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO SEE WHAT THESE CANDIDATES COULD
HIS MIND WAS MADE UP
I'M DEALING WITH PEOPLE
YOU'VE GIVEN THEM THAT TRUST AND THEN
ACTUALLY THIS IS ALL WRONG
I THINK WHAT WE CAN SEE HERE IS THAT JAMES HADN'T REALLY BOUGHT INTO THE THREE CANDIDATES AND
WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE CONTROL OF
BUNGING UP THE ROADS
WE'VE BROUGHT TWO TEAMS
OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO
SHOPPING TIME'S UP AND IT'S TIME TO LOAD UP
WE'RE IN WI GREEN
WHICH IS MINUS FORTY FIVE
I'VE MET SOMEONE ELSE
PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS A JOKE
BARRY AND I HAVE BEEN SORTING OUT THE GUEST LIST
I NOT SURE MIDSUMMER IS QUITE RIGHT
IT WAS GREAT FUN
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE SENT FUNTE ALONG THE M FOUR TO CARDIFF IN FACT TO FIND OUT BECAUSE THEY WILL KNOW THE GOOD
LED BY BIG ISSUE FOUNDER
THE WORLD WOULD BE BORING IF WE WERE ALL THE SAME
WHAT STRATEGY DO YOU SET UP TO MAKE THE HOUSE WORK FOR THEM AND
AND SARAH DOES AS WELL
SHOP WELL FOR LESS
WE CALLED HIM WITH THE NEWS BUT HE DIDN'T PICK UP
THE WIND AND THE RAIN HAS MADE THE COWS QUITE SPOOKY
THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS IMAGINE
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE UP TO EITHER
PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY
HE WAS ALSO A BERSERKER
WHICH MEANT THAT HE RUSHED AROUND ROARING HIS HEAD OFF
AND HERE'S A QUICK GLIMPSE OF THEIR WARLIKE TACTICS
IF YOU GET THAT FOR
I TELL YOU WHAT
IS IT WORTH IT FOR A POUND AND
THEY'RE NOT THE FINEST QUALITY
SIXTY MINUTES ARE UP
PRODUCING THESE DOLLS HEADS FOR ALL SORTS OF MANUFACTURERS ACROSS EUROPE AND THE
AND THE IDEA IS THAT THIS DOLL SAT ON THE TOP OF THE CHRISTMAS TREE FOR A FAMILY
WHAT'S IT WORTH
MINOR CHANGES TO PAYROLL
BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY ARE
THIS IS GOING TO SOUND LIKE A DAFT QUESTION
DID OUR SURGERY BUILDING
WHAT ABOUT THE CLINIC TIMETABLES
BUT THE NHS IS CHANGING
WITH REGARDS TO THAT
WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID
WHEN I THINK OF BARRY
YOU CAN MANAGE TO POST A LETTER
IT'S TIME TO GET OUR VALUATIONS UNDER WAY
AND AFTER EXPLORING ALL THE POSSIBILITIES
IT'S A DOCUMENT
IF I WAS SELLING THE ROBOT RIGHT NOW
IT'S GOING UNDER THE HAMMER
SO IT'S TIME FOR US TO TAKE OFF TO AUCTION FOR THE FIRST TIME
YOU LOVE IT AS WELL
IT'S GOING UNDER THE HAMMER
AND THAT WAS TO TRAIN DESIGNERS TO HELP OUT WITH THE COUNTRY'S GROWING INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT
SET UP WITH A VERY PRACTICAL MISSION
ONE THING IS FOR SURE THE NEXT GENERATION OF GRADUATES THAT LEAVES HERE WILL CONTINUE TO INSPIRE
GEORGE HARRISON YOU NAME IT
IT WASN'T A THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THANK YOU FOR STRUGGLING IN WITH WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY HEAVY BAG TO BRING THIS LOVELY THREE
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT
LIKE TO FEEL THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT HAS LAIN
BIDDING FROM HOME
JOIN US AGAIN FOR MANY MORE SURPRISES
THAT'S WHY HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BEFORE
JUST UNDER EIGHTY NINE PERCENT OF PATIENTS WERE SEEN IN ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY WITHIN FOUR HOURS IN JANUARY
ARE YOU PAYING TOO MUCH FOR ENERGY
WELL MILLIONS OF US COULD SEE OUR BILLS COME DOWN
THE VINTAGE JET HIT THE GROUND AND EXPLODED NEAR A BUSY ROAD
HE STARTED TO CRY
BY MY READING OF THE TRANSCRIPT
IT WOULD BE FORTY PLUS YEARS AGO
YOU WILL GET THE REWARD FOR THAT WORK
SHE WENT STRAIGHT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
LISTEN TO ME NOW
THIS IS THE SITUATION WE HAVE
BUT HE IS A WASTE
COME ENJOY THE VILLA
WE'VE GOT ABOUT POINT
YOUR WEDDING CAKE WAS ON THIS
STRAIGHT IN AND STRAIGHT OUT
WE HAVE MADELINE'S DIAMOND AND SAPPHIRE RING
I'VE GOT MY FAVOURITES
NOW BEFORE WE HEAD BACK TO THE PIER AT WESTERN SUPER MARE TO FIND SOME MORE ANTIQUES TO PUT TO THE TEST
THERE'S THREE PIERS WITHIN THE SPACE OF TWELVE MILES
AND EACH ONE OF THEM
IN THEIR OWN WAY
AH BUT FOR THE WORKING CLASSES
GIVING WORKERS THE RIGHT TO TIME OFF
ALL OF A SUDDEN
AND GAVE RISE TO THE GOLDEN AGE OF PIER BUILDING
WE WANT SOME OF THAT
MOVING WITH THE TIMES
NO DOUBT SOMEONE DID SCOOP IT UP ONE DAY
AND OUR EXPERTS HAVE FOUND THEIR FINAL ITEMS TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER
SO WE HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE
I'M GOING TO JOIN YOU DOWN
WHO LOVES CAMERA SALES
IT'S GOOD QUALITY
FIVE CONTENDERS TONIGHT
BECAUSE IT'S A SEMIFINAL
WHICH MEANS THEY'VE ALL BEEN HERE BEFORE AND THAT'S SOME HELP
THANKS FOR WATCHING
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO IS KEPT
TURNED INTO A COMMODITY AND EXPLOITED
SO THEIR LIBERTY IS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM
THE INVISIBLE HANDCUFFS
THEY COULD BE WALKING AROUND THE COMMUNITY
AND THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE THEY CAN WALK AROUND
BECAUSE SOMEBODY MAY HAVE TAKEN THEIR DOCUMENTS
THEY ESTIMATE THAT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM THERE ARE BETWEEN TEN
SO INITIALLY PEOPLE
CANNOT LEAVE THE SITUATION
AND THEN OVER TIME PEOPLE BECOME LESS AND LESS ABLE TO LEAVE THE SITUATION
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNGER
HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS
SO THE TWENTY S ISLAND
YOU MAKE IT INTO YOUR EIGHTY S AND YOU'RE LIVING ALONE ON ST KILDA
THERE COMES A POINT IN EVERY MARRIAGE
EVEN THE HAPPIEST
NOT FOR THE LONG MARRIED
SHE'S NOT EASTERN EUROPEAN
IT'S NOT ABOUT MONEY
FOUND MYSELF A STREET FULL OF SHUFFLING GHOULS
I KNOW IT'S ALL RELATIVE
MAYBE WE'LL HAVE TO STRUGGLE ON WITHOUT YOGHURT
SHE'S GOT PREVIOUS
THIS IS THE PROBLEM
I DON'T JUST HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE YOUNGER
GOOD LOOKING GUYS
THE WHOLE WORLD
THAT'S VERY KIND BUT
YOU MUST MEET MARY
SHE'S SUCH A LAUGH
YOU'LL LOVE HER
IT WRITES ITSELF
AS HAPPY TODAY AS I WAS THEN
DID YOU HEAR THAT
IT'S A BIG HOUSE
AND HE IS VERY LUCKY TO HAVE YOU
LOOK UP BLISSFULLY HAPPY AND IT SAYS
MORE THAN ANYTHING
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
INTENDED TO MILDLYSS
ENDED UP CALLING HER A MONEY GRUBBING WHORE
THE PRIME MINISTER SHOULD USE THIS TECHNIQUE AT THE DISPATCH BOX
I THINK A MOVE TO THE COUNTRY
WAS THAT ALL RIGHT
SP WAS MUCH LONGER
THIRDCASE THERE
I CAME HERE TO HUNT
THIS WAS MEANT TO BE ONE LAST WEEKEND
I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS
SHE'S STABLE BUT HER RES AREN'T GREAT SO WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET GOING
THAT IS CORRECT
WHY DON'T I GO TO THE VENDING MACHINE
WHEN IT OPENED IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX
THEY HAD A HIGH STATUS IN LIFE
FORGET ALL THE THINGS YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO ON IT
NOT THE OTHER WAY
I'M SO PLEASED I DIDN'T STICK MY NECK OUT AND SAY
VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT HAVING INNER CITY CHILDREN
AND CERTAINLY MY SCHOOL TRIPS
NO WONDER THEY'RE HAVING SUCH AN INSPIRING TIME
THIS PLACE IS UNFORGETTABLE
I COULDN'T HAVE LEARNED ALL THE BUSINESS
ALL THE GRASSLAND
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CLUB WHERE I'M IN NOW
BUT I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS YOU HAVE TO TRY TO PERSUADE HIM
I'M NOT REACTING
COMING HERE TODAY IS
YOU DON'T JUST TURN UP AND DO THE GIG
THOUSAND MEMBERS AND THAT'S RISING ALL THE TIME
AND JUST HAVING FUN
IT'S JUST PEOPLE
AND IT'S ALL TO DO WITH GIRL POWER
YEAH IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM
BEING A FARMER MEANS THE WEATHER IS EITHER YOUR FRIEND OR FOE
BUT THE REAL MEASURE OF SUCCESS
IF YOU CAN RUN A FARM LIKE THIS
IT WAS REALLY GOOD AND JUST GIVING ME THAT
IT'S A MODERN BUSINESS
THEY CAN BE CONSULTANTS THEY CAN BE
IT'S BEEN BRILLIANT SEEING HOW PASSIONATE THESE YOUNG FARMERS ARE ABOUT AGRICULTURE
THERE THE FARMERS OF THE FUTURE AND WILL HOPEFULLY KEEP THE GREAT TRADITION OF BRITISH FARMING
MATT AND ELLIE ARE IN SUSSEX
YOU FEEL LIKE REALLY
IF I CAN SAY THAT
AND ON THE SUMMIT IS AN ENVIRONMENT THAT'S UNLIKE ANYWHERE ELSE ON EARTH
THAT IS JUST FINE BY ME
CONSIDERING WE'RE ALL HERE
I HAVE TO ADMIT
NO BIGGER THAN MY LITTLE FINGER
THE CONSTANT BATTERING OF RAIN
AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT
THE LARGEST WEIGHING FIVE
A DIAMOND'S A DIAMOND IT'S WHITE
IT'S A LOVELY THING
WE HAVE AUCTION HOUSES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED
INTERNATIONAL AUCTION HOUSES
TO PRIVATE MUSEUMS
IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION
I THINK IT'S FALLEN BETWEEN TWO STOOLS BECAUSE IT'S NOT COMPLETELY BRITISH
BUT A WHOLE SEPARATE SCHOOL OF COLLECTING HAS DEVELOPED
PEOPLE WHO ARE FASCINATED BY THE CULTURAL EXCHANGE AND THE FUSION
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE CONTINUITY OF CRAFTSMANSHIP
THE FACT IS THAT YOU CAN REPRODUCE AND
WE STILL HAVE A STRONG ENGAGEMENT WITH PRODUCTION AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES INDIAN
WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY WERE ONE OF THE FIRST MULTINATIONALS
AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK VERY CLOSELY
AND WE'VE WORKED OUT
LIKE A LOT OF THESE EARLY RECIPE BOOKS
IF WE HAD A WORK LIKE THIS AT AUCTION
I MIGHT COME BACK FOR MY PARTNER
THEY HAD A FRIEND THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON
HE WAS ONE OF THEM AND HE SAID
START YOUR OWN CLUB
WE GOT IT IN EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT
EACH IMAGE NEEDS TO REVEAL SOMETHING ABOUT OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
OF OTHER BODIES WITHIN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
AND WE'VE CHOSEN WHAT WE THINK ARE THE FIVE MOST SIGNIFICANT
WE'VE KNOWN THAT FOR SOME TIME
YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT TO BE ESSENTIALLY WHITE
BUT THERE ARE SOME CONTAMINANTS IN IN THE RINGS AS WELL
BUT TAKEN IN A VERY SPECIAL GEOMETRY
AND ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS RATHER PRIMITIVE NOW
SEEN FLOATING ON ITS OWN
WATER ICE WOULDN'T BE STRONG ENOUGH
SO WHAT WE THINK IS GOING ON HERE THESE ARE CRYOVOCANOES
NOT VOLCANOES IN THE WAY THAT WE'RE USED TO THEM
WITH HOT ROCK AND LAVA
BUT RATHER VOLCANOES THAT WOULD HAVE EMITTED ICE
WE DON'T SEE THEM BEING ACTIVE NOW
WE DON'T SEE ANY OUTFLOW FROM THEM AT THE MOMENT BUT
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY WERE LAST ACTIVE
BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY ENOUGH STRANGE TERRAIN AROUND THEM TO INDICATE THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN
THESE CAUSED IMPACT CRATERS
AND AND WHAT I'M TRYING WHAT I'M TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH A LOT OF THESE IMAGES
ORBITING THE SAME SOURCE OF LIGHT
AND IN THAT ONE IMAGE OF GALE CRATER
SO WHAT SHOULD I BE LOOKING AT
IF I WANT TO BE A MARTIAN GEOLOGIST
IT SEEMS THAT NO
IT PROBABLY WASN'T EVER FILLED LIKE THAT
THERE WAS WATER HERE
THERE WERE SMALL LAKES THAT CAME AND WENT AT THE SCALE OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS
THE FIRST THING WE THINK ABOUT IS CONTEXT
BECAUSE EVEN I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET
IT'S ONLY JUST BEEN TAKEN
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE CHOSE THIS IMAGE
WE CAN GET MUCH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COSMOS
OUR CHOICES FOR THE TOP FIVE SOLAR SYSTEM PHOTOS
YOU CAN USE TWITTER TO LET US KNOW
BUT WHATEVER YOUR FAVOURITE IMAGES
CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE
THAT'S A LOVELY IDEA
THE CRADLE WILL ROCK WHEN THE BOW BREAKS
YOU CAN'T JUST DO NOTHING
I WANTED TO BE STRONG FOR YOU
JUST FOR TEN SECONDS TOO LONG
THE BEST THING FOR YOU WOULD BE TO STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM ME AS POSSIBLE
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO ASK YOU
HE'S ASKED FOR ME TO BE THE APPRAISER
THANK YOU FOR ASKING
HAN WAS ALWAYS READING NOVELS AND POETRY
BUT THAT'S TRUE FOR ALL OF US
IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU ARE A VERY VALUABLE ASSET TO THE PRACTICE
YOU REALLY LIKED THAT
THEY ORGANIZED DAY TRIPS TOURING THE LAKES
TRAVELLING BY TRAIN
HORSE DRAWN COACH
LAKE BANK JETTY ON CONISTON WATER
WHEN I WAS APPROACHING
AND ONE OF THE FIRST TO BE COMMISSIONED BY THE FURNESS RAILWAY COMPANY
WILL BE WITH US FOR MANY MORE GENERATIONS TO COME
IT'S TIME TO GO INSIDE AND CATCH UP WITH OUR EXPERTS TO FIND MORE TREASURES TO TAKE OFF TO AUCTION
ISN'T THAT RIGHT
IT SEEMS TO HERE FOR THE PENNINGTON FAMILY
ONLY FAMILY MEMBERS KNOW WHERE IT IS
IT'S OUR SECRET
IF I DO TELL YOU BY ACCIDENT
YOU BETTER START RUNNING
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO FURNISH IT
HE BROKE THE WORLD RECORD ON LAND
OFTEN HAVE MORE OF A FOLLOWING
SAME IN IN POP MEMORABILIA
NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE
THAT COULD BE GOING BACK HOME BRILLIANT
AND THIS HAPPENS
IN FATHER'S TIME
IT WAS PREMATURE
THE BULLS WOULD BE ABOUT FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN MONTHS
IT COULD BE ANY NUMBER OF THINGS
ALL CHILDREN UP TO THE AGE OF ELEVEN SHOULD BE VACCINATED AGAINST MENINGITIS B
THEIR PETITION HAS BEEN SIGNED BY MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND
POLICE SAY A FIRE THAT BADLY DAMAGED A SIXTEENTH CENTURY HALL IN MANCHESTER IS SUSPICIOUS
THE ROOF OF WILLENSHAW HALL WAS DESTROYED IN THE BLAZE
AT LEAST TWO SUSPECTS ARE ON THE RUN AFTER AN ANTI TERRORR RAID IN BRUSSELS
SHOTS WERE FIRED AND FOUR OFFICERS WERE INJURED
THE RAID WAS LINKED TO NOVEMBER'S PARIS ATTACKS
AND WE GET TOGETHER EVERY SO OFTEN
FAMED FOR HIS BAROQUE PAINTINGS OF FLESHY WOMEN AND CHILDREN
AND TODAY IS A VERY
I HOPE IT BRINGS YOU GOOD LUCK
THEY TAKE IT AWAY
REPORTED MISSING BY HER MOTHER TWO WEEKS AGO
SO I CAN'T IMAGINE
HE'S A VERY BAD MAN
PRECIPITATION OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS
THEY'LL GET THE MINIMUM
WE PROMISE WE'LL HAVE THEM BACK AND WITHIN TEN DAYS
AND THE TEN DAYS HAS COME AND GONE
MIDDLE A SECOND WEEK
WHICH WAS VERY MUCH ON TREND AT THE TIME
WHAT HAPPENED WAS
SO THEY'RE STILL VALUABLE
WHO'S WITH ME RIGHT NOW
YOU ARE SHARING RESPONSIBILITY
I KNOW WHAT SOME OF YOU WOULD THINK FAST FOOD
A JEWISH GENTLEMAN
THE CLOSER YOU GOT TO JOHN KNOX
THERE ARE OTHER MONUMENTS HERE THAT TELL A TALE OF THEIR OWNERS' OCCUPATION
LIKE MALCOLM CAMPBELL
THEY WERE QUITE PLENTIFUL IN IN PRODUCTION
AND THERE'S A REASON WHY I DON'T LIKE IT
AND IT DOES CHANGE COLOUR
AND I'VE ALSO ENJOYED SHOWING YOU AROUND SOME OF MY FAVOURITE TREASURES HERE AT POLLOCK HOUSE IN
JOIN US AGAIN SOON
AND WE'VE HAD SOME WONDERFUL RESULTS IN THE AUCTION ROOM
I'M ESPECIALLY PLEASED FOR ASHLEY AND THE SILVER TANKER THAT WENT SO WELL
COME NO PSYCHOLOGY GUY
I'VE I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO THINK
IT'S ALL BEEN OKAY AND EVERYTHING
WHY DON'T YOU COME IN
I'M YOUR COUNSELLOR
NICE TO KNOW YOU CARED
IT COMES AFTER MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND
THOUSAND PEOPLE SIGNED A PETITION
OR IF THEY OWN A BANNED BREED
LIKE A PIT BULL TERRIER
HE FOUND OUT HE HAD A BRAIN TUMOUR ONLY A FEW WEEKS AGO
NOT SO MUCH NOT WANTING TO SPEAK
BECAUSE SHE WAS A SINGLE WOMAN
IN IN HIS LIVING MEMORY
STAYED IMPORTANT TO ME
I ALWAYS TRYING TO GET THEM TO EXTRA LESSONS
I THINK YOU CAN TELL THAT OUT
HUNDRED YEARS BETWEEN IT
BEYOND HIS NAME
I THINK I DO SHARE SOME SIMILARITIES AND
OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD BE THE THE LOVE OF COUNTRY SPORTS
BUT LET ME TELL YOU
THOSE DAYS ARE GONE
I'M WELL RID OF IT
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT
IT NEEDED SOMEONE TO LOVE IT AND PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO IT
AND MANY MANY NIGHTS SLEEPLESS NIGHTS BUT
I'VE GOT TWO ARMS
I KNOW YOU'RE HAVING A ROUGH TIME AT THE MOMENT
I SAID TO YOU SHE'S FRAGILE
I'M REALLY HURT
THE MONEY GOES BACK INTO THE PRACTICE
WE WOULD NOT HAVE A SHOW
AND I CAN GUARANTEE ONE OR TWO REAL TREASURES TODAY
IF THEY'RE HAPPY WITH THE VALUATION
BUT FORTUNATELY FOR ME
I KNOW THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE
I THINK IT'S SPLENDID
INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR
THEY DID HAVE FUN IN THIS ROOM
AND AFTER THE WAR
THERE WERE HOLES EVERYWHERE
IT'S A LOVELY STORY
GOOD JOB AS WELL
OUR EXPERTS HAVE MADE THEIR FIRST CHOICE OF ITEMS
THIS LOT ARE COMING UP LATER ON IN THE SHOW
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE
ALL THE INFORMATION IS PRINTED INSIDE
WE ARE COMING BACK
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU ON A TRIP TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING QUITE NAIVE
EARLIER ON IN THE WEEK
WHILE WE WERE IN THE AREA FILMING
WAITING FOR THEIR VALUATION
SO I THINK WE'LL PUT A RESERVE OF SIX HUNDRED
WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE FOUND
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT BIG SURPRISE I PROMISED YOU
AND IT'S TO RAISE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
HAVING SAID THAT
IF YOU'VE GOT ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SELL
WELL I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT BECAUSE
AH JUST OUTSIDE OF NEWTON ABBOT
WE ARE COMING BACK LATER IN THE PROGRAMME
WHILE WE WERE FILMING IN THE AREA
I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF GOING BACK TO THE COAST AND DOING SOME SIGHTSEEING WITH A DIFFERENCE
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME OUT TODAY
A CHAP BY THE NAME OF JOHN
THEY BECAME VERY POOR
SAY I KNOW IT'S COLLECTABLE
WE DON'T NORMALLY END ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS
NOT EVERYONE'S A WINNER
I MEAN NOT THE HOLIDAY
IN KING'S REGULATIONS
BITES THE CARPET
AH NO OFFENCE INTENDED
I SEE IT THIS WAY
I WANT THOSE STRIPES
HE NOW REALIZES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AND
I'D ALSO CONSIDER IT AN HONOUR
NOT JUST FOR HER
SHE TOLD ME THAT ABOUT THE NICEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO HER IN THAT TIME WAS DISCOVERING THIS
JUST ASK QUESTIONS
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT FERTILITY PRESERVATION
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN RECEIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT AND CARE SO THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE BREAST CANCER
YOU'VE GUESSED IT
AND I'M PRETTY SURE HIS PUSH BIKE CAME IN VERY HANDY
WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU
CHECK THE DETAILS ON OUR WEBSITE
BECAUSE HOPEFULLY WE'RE COMING TO A TOWN VERY NEAR YOU SOON
SO I THINK THAT'S JUST PREJUDICE ON THE PEOPLE ON THE PART OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT OPINION
THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY CRITICISM OF ANY INDEPENDENT SCHOOL USING SHOTGUNS
YEAH I'LL BE LISTENING OUT FOR DRUMMING
I THINK IT WAS JUST THROUGH THERE
UP TO THE TOP OF THE TREES
AND THE CHILDREN
IT'S A VERY FAMILIAR THING
AND ESPECIALLY AROUND HERE
WE CAN COME UP HERE
GLOUCESTERSHIRE AND WORCESTERSHIRE
I DON'T THINK SO
BUT WHATEVER IT WAS
AND BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CASE HERE
OR IT COULD ACTUALLY BE THE SMOKING GUN THAT TELLS YOU THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FORMED THAT
IT OCCURRED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
IMAGINE IF THAT HAPPENED IN THE HEART OF A CITY
DOESN'T BEAR THINKING ABOUT
AND PHENOMENA LIKE THIS CAN CROP UP ALMOST ANYWHERE
WHICH IS A BODY OF WATER
WHICH IS A LARGER BODY OF WATER
SO THAT'S WATER WITHIN WATER
WHICH SURELY CAN'T BE POSSIBLE
HUNDREDS OF METRES BELOW THE SURFACE
THIS DENSE BRINY WATER IS SITTING BELOW THE TYPICAL SALTY SEAWATER
CAUSING A GOLD RUSH
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU WOKE UP IN THE MORNING
BUT WHAT IT HAS DONE IS PERHAPS STOP THE UNNECESSARY DESTRUCTION OF OUR FORESTS
IT'S AN ECOLOGICAL RESULT FROM A WEIRD PHENOMENON
AH SURELY THAT'S THE STUFF OF FICTION
VERY GOOD AT COMMUNICATING WITH ONE ANOTHER WE KNOW THAT
BUT WHAT ABOUT PLANTS
SURELY THEY CAN'T COMMUNICATE IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
AS IT TURNS OUT
A WAY TO SAVE HUMAN LIVES
SOME GREAT MINDS HAVE GOT TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH AN INVENTION WHICH IS
WHAT A BRILLIANT SOLUTION TO A SLIPPERY PROBLEM
WHENEVER I SHAKE SOMEONE'S HAND
CHANGES IN AN ANIMAL'S APPEARANCE HAVE GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH FASHION SENSE
FRUITFUL AND HAPPY LIVES
WHICH IS A GOOD THING
AND IT'S NOT ALL A ONE WAY STREET
AND BECAUSE YOU NEED THREE UNUSUAL FACTORS TO COME TOGETHER
AS I TAUGHT YOU NOW
SO WHEN IT DIEES INTO THE WATER TO GET FISH
IT'S BEEN SOMETIMES SURPRISING AND
BUT THE ONE THING THAT'S STILL FOR SURE IS THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE WEIRDNESS JUST WAITING OUT
WE TOLD YOU IT WAS GOING TO BE WEIRD AND
THE SITUATION AT ST FEELS CAN BE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING
I'M HERE TO ESCORT YOU
YOU WAIT AT YOURS
AND HE GAVE ME HIS MOBILE NUMBER
BUT IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE TO ME
JUST TO BRING BACK THESE EXOTIC SPICES FOR US TO ENJOY
HENCE THE TATE GALLERIES IN LONDON
WHAT MONEY WE GET
I TALKED ABOUT IT
SO ANY SPARE TIME
HOW DO YOU PICK A BOYFRIEND
FROM WHAT I HEARD
WHICH IS A BIG LIFT
JUST ABOUT TEN DIESLEY
THAT THIS SMALL NEWBORN THING POPS OUT AND AND GETS ITS FEET ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
IS IN THE MOOD
IT WAS ALL TRUE
HE'S REALLY CAMP
THE FIFTEEN YEAR OLD WENT MISSING ON SATURDAY
POLICE NOW SAY THEY'RE TREATING HER DEATH AS MURDER
DO YOU PAY FOR A PHONE LINE YOU DON'T USE
THE CULTURE MINISTER THINKS YOU SHOULDN'T
THE AIRPORT AND A METRO STATION WERE TARGETED
DOZENS HAVE BEEN HURT
AND HE WAS SEEN AT THE AIRPORT SHORTLY BEFORE THE EXPLOSIONS
SECURITY HAS BEEN STEPPED UP HERE IN BRITAIN AND ACROSS EUROPE
OF ALL MIGRANTS TO BRITAIN
BUT TWENTY YEARS AGO
WITH CHRISTIANITY IN DECLINE
IT CAN ALSO BE A CHALLENGE
THE TRADITIONAL CHURCH STRUCTURES ARE HAVING TO TAKE IMMIGRATION MUCH MORE SERIOUSLY
THEY'RE HAVING TO LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND
JOINING THE CHURCHES IN QUITE LARGE NUMBERS
SPEAKING A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE
PERHAPS COMING FROM DIFFERENT FORMS OF WORSHIP AND WANTING TO BRING CHANGE
AFRICAN CARIBBEAN PEOPLE BROUGHT THEIR OWN TRADITION OF STREET PREACHING CALLED WARNERS
IN RECENT TIMES
WE LOVE EVERYBODY
MONOGA MONOGAMO MARRIAGE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN IS GOD'S DEFINITION OF
WILL I RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE'S VIEWS
AM I GOING TO CONDEMN OR JUDGE OTHER PEOPLE'S VIEWS
THAT'S TOTALLY UNRISIAN
CERTAIN SECTIONS OF SOCIETY WOULD LOVE THAT STRUGGLE TO EXIST AND WOULD LOVE TO
AND I SAY TO THEM
WHAT MATTER TO ME IS THAT I LIVE MY LIFE
AS BEST AS I CAN
AND YOU CHOOSE TO TRADE AS A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE
AND THAT WON'T BE EASY
THAT'S FOR SURE
SOCIETY NO LONGER SPEAKS THE SAME LANGUAGE
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY SAD FUTURE FOR CHRISTIANITY
AND THE TRADITION WE HAVE IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IS OF HAVING ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT VIEWS AND FAITHS AND
THE ADVERTISERS CONCERNED DO NOT ACCEPT ANY POLITICAL OR ANY RELIGIOUS ADVERTISING OF ANY
THE CHURCH IS NEITHER RIGHT NOR LEFT
IT IDENTIFIES WITH THE KINGDOM OF GOD
IN DIFFERENT WAYS
IN TERMS OF ITS ETHICS AND ITS CONCERNS
IN OUR DIVERSE NATION
LET'S START TALKING ABOUT THIS
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN TURN TO
BUT IT'S NOT THEIR PRIMARY IDENTITY
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY QUITE FRIGHTENED OF REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC RELIGION
IT SEEMS A BIT CRAZY
IN THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE IN PRISON
AND OFTEN PEOPLE WHO
THEY SEE THE CHURCHES DOING THE HOMELESS SHELTERS
THEY SEE THE CHURCHES ARE THE ONES WHO ARE VOLUNTEERING IN SOCIETY
THE ONES WHO ARE WANTING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
THE ONES WHO ARE MEETING THE OFFENDERS WHEN THEY COME OUT OF PRISON AND LOOKING AFTER THEM
COMPRISED OF VOLUNTEERS
ALL ROUND THE COUNTRY
WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND DO SOMETHING
RELIGION OR BACKGROUND
INSIDE A CHURCH
THE CHURCH HAS BEEN SEEN
AND SOMETIMES ACTED
ONE OF US DECIDES WHAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING TOGETHER OF THEIR CHOICE
THAT MONEY COULD GO TO A FAMILY TRIP
YOU WANT TO LOOK COOL
YOU WANT TO BE AHEAD OF THE TREND
THIS FAMILY NEED TO BE STOPPED IN THEIR TRACKS
HE'S ENCOURAGING THEM TO BUY
THAT WAS A FORTUNE
WITHOUT THE FLASH
KNOW WILL IT BE AN ETHICAL BRAND
I'D HAVE TO BE USING IT FOR THE WHOLE WEEK
IN TERMS OF POLISH
RATHER THAN SOMEONE ELSE'S PRODUCTS
BUT THEY CAN BE QUITE PRICEY
AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY
IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT AND IF YOU WANT TO
THEN ETHICAL IS A REALLY GOOD WAY TO GO
I'VE GOT A DRILL FOR LIKE DRILLING CONCRETE
I WANT TO DO THIS JOB AT HOME
I THINK IT MAKES ANYTHING POSSIBLE
THE MONEY IS ALREADY THERE
BECAUSE IT'S HERE
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL END UP WITH A PRODUCT THAT BEST SUITS YOUR NEEDS
I'LL EMAIL YOU THE LINK
I WAS A NEW ROMANTIC
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE
IN TERMS OF YOUR AIMS AND GOALS
WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN
THEN IT'S HARD FOR US
I'M NOT STOCKS OR SHARES
I DON'T NEED INVESTMENT
JUST MY MONTHLY PAY
OH AYESHA MENTIONED A STAR SYSTEM
WE HAVE UPILES
UNLESS YOU PURSUE IT
SO YOU SHOULD BE SAFE
THERE ARE THREE COURSES THAT I'M CONSIDERING
I'M AIMING TO GET BETTER AND LAST MONTH WAS QUICKER
REAL LIFE ISN'T THAT STRAIGHTFORWARD THANK GOD
LADEN WITH ALL SORTS OF ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES
WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO
IT BELONGS TO MAUREEN
WHO'S WITH ME RIGHT NOW
THAT'S THE MAIN THING
WITH ITS LONG HISTORY OF TRADITIONAL SUMMER SEASON
AS I'VE BEEN FINDING OUT
I WISH IT HAD BEEN
SINCE THE MID NINETEENTH CENTURY
WITH THE NEW FACTORY LAWS BEING INTRODUCED IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTY S AND ALSO THE RAILWAY NETWORK
THERE ARE STILL SOME VENUES AROUND
I THINK I DO NOW
BECAUSE YOU'RE SPOT ON THE MONEY
EVERYBODY HAS THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THEMSELVES
WE ARE NOW GOING OVER TO THE AUCTION ROOM FOR THE VERY LAST TIME
ALL THE BIG JOBS
IT'S BEEN ABOUT THE MINUS TWO
FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO
AND THEN WE STARTED MAKING OURSELVES AND TODAY
IT'S VERY STRANGE I'VE NOT BEING THERE
SO THAT MIGHT CHANGE
BUT I DON'T MIND THAT
WHO'S NOT A CHEF A SCIENTIST
IT'S ALL ABOUT FOOD
GREEN FOOD COLOURING
THIS IS HORSERADISH
IT'S AMAZING THAT
IT'S JUST THE AFTERMATH
ON THE OTHER HAND
I AM AN ACADEMIC
THAT'S THAT'S FANTASTIC
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY TRYING MY RED STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM AND THEY'VE HAD NO TROUBLE
REGARDLESS OF THEIR COLOUR
IT'S NOT TOO WET
IT DOESN'T WORK
HOW DOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS GET TURNED INTO MY FAVOURITE INDULGENCE
WE'RE IN THE ROYAL COUNTY OF BERKSHIRE
WILL THE REDS REIGN SUPREME
WOOL IS JUST ANOTHER MEDIUM
IT WAS PRICED AT EIGHTY FIVE
IF WE COULD GET THAT FORTY
YOU SHOULD NEVER TELL A BOOK BY ITS COVER
LOGS AND THINGS
IT MIGHT JUST BE SLIGHTLY MORE APPEALING TO BUY
WHETHER OR NOT ANYONE WHO BUYS THAT WOULD RISK LOSING IT BY PUTTING IT ON THE BONNET OF THEIR CAR
THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL A BARGAIN
IT COULD BE YOURS FOR EIGHT THOUSAND
AND I SPEND HOURS POKING AROUND THESE PLACES HOPING
TO HAVE A EUREKA MOMENT LIKE THIS
WHICH IS OVERALL
BUT IT'S HARD TO STAY POSITIVE WHEN YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
BUT I SAID TO MYSELF
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER
I'D WANT TO KEEP TABS ON YOUR WHEREABOUTS
PUCK ISN'T THE ONLY ONE
I'VE BEEN SENT OUT OF A DRESSING ROOM FOR MENTIONING IT
AND THEN WAIT TO BE INVITED BACK IN
IT'S ALSO A PLAY FILLED WITH SOME OF THE MOST MEMORABLE QUOTES
WE WILL HIDE OURSELVES
IS HE FLAWED IN SOME WAY THAT ALLOWED THIS THIS LEGEND TO BUILD UP
WHERES THE MONEY COMING FROM FOR THE THE BIG HOUSE
WHERES THE MONEY COMING FROM FOR THIS AND THAT
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
I THINK HIS LOVE WAS THE WORD
HOW WERE THE TOURING COMPANIES REGARDED
WE GOT THERE AND OUR FIRST PERFORMANCE WASWE NIGHT
AND JOHN NEVILLE SAID TO ME
THAT BLOWS YOUR MIND
BE BUT SWORN MY LOVE
MAYBE WE AREN'T SO MUCH TODAY
I THINK TO SHAKESPEARE'S AUDIENCE THAT EACH ONE OF THEM WOULD HAVE A MEANING AND
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S PICKING UP ON
STRANGE BUNCH OF PLANTS THAT
BUT THEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT LOADING THE ARROWS CORRECTLY
AND TRYING TO GET A BOW AND ARROW SORTED OUT
YOU JUST MAKE THE WORLD COMPLETE
JUST BECAUSE HE DID SOMETHING THAT NONE OF US ARE CAPABLE OF DOING
WITH WITH EXTREMELY LIMITED PRACTICE
AND HEAR YOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM
AND AS FOR TRENTHAM HALL
IS ENOUGH TO PAY FOR YOUR FLIGHT OVER HERE
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS
AND A QUIRKY OBJECT LIKE THIS TO THE RIGHT BUYER
AH REALLY AS FAR FAR AS COMING UP IN AUCTION
WHEN I FIRST SAW IT
I THINK IF YOU PUT THAT IN
WHERE DOES IT GO FROM HERE
THE VALUES OF THEM
AND HE DECIDED THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE A METAL THAT WAS MORE AFFORDABLE THAN THE STANDARDISED EIGHTEEN
AND IT'S A GREAT CENTRE OF CRAFTSMANSHIP
COME BACK TO THE NEXT DAY
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PART WITH IT
AND QUALITY WAS ALWAYS PARAMOUNT
SOME OF THOSE DESCENDANTS MAY MAY BE WEALTHY AND CERTAINLY WOULD BE PEOPLE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT BUYING
AND HE DIDN'T RETIRE UNTIL HE WAS ABOUT SEVENTY THREE
THIS IS AMAZING
IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY DIFFICULT PICTURE TO VALUE
I THINK IT'S WORTH AT LEAST FORTY
THAT IS JUST GROUND AWAY
WEDDINGS HAD TO TAKE PLACE IN THE MORNING
THAT WAS THE RULES
SO YOU HAD VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT
THEY KEEP YOU IN YOUR PLACE
WE'RE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT
WHEN SHE HERSELF DIED
THERE'S A CERTAIN
ANYTHING FROM TWO
SO YOU GET A GOOD FEEL FOR THE HEFT OF THE SWORD
VERY VERY BEGINNINGS OF A ROUGH GRIND
SO AS SOON AS THE DATE HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED
THE CERAMICS INDUSTRY SWUNG INTO GEAR
AND STARTED PRODUCING VAST QUANTITIES OF THESE THINGS
I THINK THE RATION ITSELF WAS ONE PIECE OF BACON
PEOPLE DOING HEAVY WORK
WHY NOT CONSIDER SOME OF THE PAPERWORK
THESE WERE KNOWN AS THE AUSTERITY GAMES IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT
BUT THE FOOD SITUATION IS ONE THAT MUST BE ACCEPTED AS AN INEVITABLE RESULT OF THE NATION'S
IF YOU CAN LOOK FOR COLOURFUL ARTWORK THAT REALLY SUMS UP THE DESIGN ETHICS OF THE DAY
IT WAS BASED HERE ON THE SOUTH BANK
THIS WAS ALL ABOUT OUR POSITIVE FUTURE
SO IT'S BRAND NEW
BUT VINTAGE EXAMPLES DEPENDING ON CONDITION AND DATE CAN COST YOU ANYTHING FROM EIGHTY POUNDS TO FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS
THIS PART OF TOWN BECAME KNOWN
AS WELL AS BEING A RATHER FASCINATING GUIDE TO THE EXHIBITION AND VICTORIAN TASTES OF THE TIME
IT'S WORTH BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS AND
IN REALLY NICE CONDITION
THE ORIGINAL CATALOGUES CAN FETCH AN AWFUL LOT MORE
SO BUT IT'S THE OBJECTS THAT COMMEMORATED THE EXHIBITION
THAT REALLY FORM THE BACKBONE OF THE MARKET
ALL MANNER OF DIFFERENT PIECES WERE PRODUCED TO SATISFY SUPPOSE THE DESIRES OF THOSE SIX MILLION PEOPLE WHO
WHICH WAS VERY POPULAR MATERIAL FOR MAKING ALL MANNER OF ITEMS
REPRESENTS LOVE WITHOUT END
THAT IS JUST GROUND AWAY
YOU CAN TELL THINGS ARE WRONG OR RIGHT
THAT WAS THE RULES
WE'RE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT
WHEN SHE HERSELF DIED
THERE'S A CERTAIN
SO YOU GET A GOOD FEEL FOR THE HEFT OF THE SWORD
CERAMICS LIKE THESE WERE PRODUCED MANY MONTHS IF NOT A YEAR IN ADVANCE
SO AS SOON AS THE DATE HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED
THE CERAMICS INDUSTRY SWUNG INTO GEAR
AND STARTED PRODUCING VAST QUANTITIES OF THESE THINGS
WHICH MEANS THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO CATCH UP WITH THE CORRECT DATE
REFLECTIONS OF MEN'S SOULS
GOLD FOR BRITAIN
I THINK THE RATION ITSELF WAS ONE PIECE OF BACON
WHY NOT CONSIDER SOME OF THE PAPERWORK
THESE WERE KNOWN AS THE AUSTERITY GAMES IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT
AND I FIND THIS PARTICULARLY FASCINATING
BUT THE FOOD SITUATION IS ONE THAT MUST BE ACCEPTED AS AN INEVITABLE RESULT OF THE NATION'S
IF YOU CAN LOOK FOR COLOURFUL ARTWORK THAT REALLY SUMS UP THE DESIGN ETHICS OF THE DAY
THAT REALLY ADDS TO THE APPEAL AND
THE VALUE AS WELL
THIS PART OF TOWN BECAME KNOWN
AS WELL AS BEING A RATHER FASCINATING GUIDE TO THE EXHIBITION AND VICTORIAN TASTES OF THE TIME
IN REALLY NICE CONDITION
SO BUT IT'S THE OBJECTS THAT COMMEMORATED THE EXHIBITION
THAT REALLY FORM THE BACKBONE OF THE MARKET
WHICH WAS VERY POPULAR MATERIAL FOR MAKING ALL MANNER OF ITEMS
I LIKE TO SEE A BIT OF DYNAMIC
THAT IS HALF TIME
EVERY DAY IS A REAL CHALLENGE
WHO WILL NORMALLY COO AND WOO AND SAY
A PASSION FRUIT GLAZE
SO WHEN IT'S PRESENTED
IT'S NOT AN EXPECTATION OF WINNING
WHAT I DIDN'T REALISE WAS THE WIND CHILL FACTOR
IT MUST BE ABOUT MINUS TWENTY DEGREES
THINKING ABOUT THE LATE AND MUCH LAMENTED KEITH FLOYD
IT HAS THIS DELICIOUS
COMING FROM THE AIRPORT
AND AS SOON AS I'D TASTED THAT
I GOT A SENSE OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE
THE WAY THEY ADD
IN MY COOKERY SCHOOL ONCE
BUT WHY DON'T YOU USE OLIVE OIL INSTEAD OF BUTTER
BECAUSE WE COME FROM A NORTHERN COUNTRY
THE STING IN THE AIR
I KNOW RIGHT AWAY
IT'S THERE READY
AND THEN FOLK CAN TAKE A SPRIG HOME AND PUT IT IN THEIR
THAT SMELLS GOOD
I KNOW RIGHT AWAY
AH BETTER WAY THAN I COULD IN MY CELL
WE'VE HAD ANOTHER ONE GO TO NORWAY
MAYBE ONE OR TWO GO TO SWEDEN
NORMALLY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU FANCY SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I'M SETTING PAUL HIS FINAL CHALLENGE AND I'M REALLY HOPING THAT ALL THE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED OVER
BUT IS JUST WILLING TO SAY
TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL
BUT HE REALLY QUICKLY PROVED THAT HE WAS MORE THAN CAPABLE OF GIVING IT A GO AND I'M REALLY IMPRESSED
WHEN THE INEVITABLE HAPPENS
LIKE IT I'M GOING FOR NEW SHOES
IT IS ALL ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE
I THINK THE WAY THAT HE OPENED HIMSELF UP AND WAS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE HE MET WAS QUITE
I REALLY WANT PAUL TO EXPERIENCE THE LIGHTER SIDE OF WHAT WE DO
WE DON'T JUST SUPPORT THOSE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING ILLNESS
WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE IN THEIR LATER YEARS GETS THE MOST OUT OF LIFE
THIS IS THE MOST PUBLIC
THEY'LL HELP ANYONE
REGARDLESS TO SEX
SO THIS WOULD BE A PERFECT HABITAT FOR THEM
A COUPLE THAT REALLY STAND OUT FOR ME WAS A DAY THAT I SPENT JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM HERE
WHICH WE HOPE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE
WHOSE LEGACY LIVES ON
THAT'S IT FOR THIS WEEK
TO WORK IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL ENVIRONMENT
WAS WILLIAM CAXTON
WHERE THERE ARE BLANKS
BUT WHAT THIS HAS
YOU'VE HAD IT FRAMED BEAUTIFULLY
HIDDEN FUNCTION AND THINGS LIKE THAT
AND THERE'S THAT LITTLE TOUCH OF MAGIC
YOU CAN HAVE THEM
YOU'VE GONE ONE STEP FURTHER YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING FROM THE SALE
I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY LOVELY
SO I HAD AN IDEA WHAT IT WAS
SO I RECKON ABOUT SEVENTEEN NINETY
IF THEY'RE FAMOUS DURING THEIR DAY
EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY
LIKE POST TRAUMATIC STRESS
THAT'S WHERE THE FACTS
SO THAT'S WHY YOU GET INTRUSIVE MEMORIES
YOU GET NIGHTMARES AND FLASHBACKS
REALLY NOT FUNCTIONING
BUT WHEN WHEN THIS ISN'T WORKING PROPERLY
AND THAT'S WHEN I WENT
AND THAT'S REALLY
WORTH IN MYSELF
SEE HOW IT GOES
I AM PROUD BUT IT
WE NEED TO FEEL WE HAVE SOME PURPOSE IN LIFE
THESE GUYS AND GIRLS
IT'S THE THING THAT REALLY MADE YOU A LEADER
OUR MODERN WORD
AS WEAPONS COME ALONG
AND WHAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE WHOLE THING
HE'S BRINGING HIS POWERHOUSE
LIKE THE CAPRIOLE
WE LOSE THAT SPEED
YOU CAN'T GET OUT
THE CIVIL WARS WERE FOUGHT BETWEEN THE PARLIAMENTARIAN ROUNDHEADS
SO CALLED BECAUSE OF THEIR PUDDING BASIN HAIRCUTS
AND THE ROYALIST CAVALIERS WHO GET THEIR NAME FROM THEIR HORSES
JUST LIKE IN FRENCH
HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY
WHEN HE AND HIS MEN ARRIVED AT THE BATTLEFIELD
AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT OLIVER CROMWELL AND THE ROUNDHEAD CAVALRY CAME CHARGING UP THE LEFT WING
LIKE HIS FATHER
HE WASN'T INTERESTED IN THAT
CHARLES' HAVE BEEN RATHER MORE SUCCESSFUL
A RACE MEETING AT THIS TIME WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE
AND THAT'S IN ONE GO
BUT I'VE DONE LESS WELL ON SUBMISSION
THE SKILLS HE WAS ABLE TO BRING AND
IF YOU GO IN A STRAIGHT LINE VERY FAST IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
IN THE CASE OF A KING OR QUEEN
A FEW NIGHTS AGO
THERE WAS ANOTHER INTRUDER
WHERE I HAVE MANY
I'M JOHN AND I'M A COMMERCIAL MANAGER
I'M RACHEL AND I WORK IN RETAIL
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
I LIKE ALL SORTS OF FILMS
I LIKE A GOOD THRILLER
I'LL SAY URUGUAY
SHE'S BEEN GIVING ME LIKE ALL SORTS OF STATISTICS AND WHO I'VE GOT TO PICK IF CERTAIN TOPICS COME UP
THIS IT WAS VERY GOOD
AND IT WAS BASED ON THE LIFE OF DANNY BAKER
I LOVED MICRO J FOX
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
IT IS TIME FOR THE FINAL ROUND
PUBLISHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
WHEREAS WHEN THE STATE PUBS COME IN
AS WE RECOGNISE IT TODAY
AFTER WORK ON THE EVENING SHIFT
AND THE LAST TRAIN CAME INTO CARYLE FIVE MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING TIME
IT WAS A PROPER
THE PLACE STANK OF WHISKEY
BUT YOU HAVE WHAT YOU CALL WET TEAMS
THEY'RE A REALLY GOOD TEAM
IT'S PROBABLY AUSTRIAN
PRESUMABLY THAT'S WHAT THE HAMMOCK'S FOR
AND WHEN THEY HAVE A DINING ROOM AND THEY HAVE A KITCHEN
EVERYBODY IS AT ONE POINT IN THE KITCHEN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE COOKING THERE AND
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO HAVE A VERY
FUN AND EXCITEMENT
AND THERE WAS A MASS EXODUS TO THE WEST
AND PLACES LIKE THIS
YOU MAY SAY THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA
REREADING GOODBYE TO BERLIN
AND THE MAIN CHARACTER IN IT
IT'S QUITE SORT OF
THE CITY OF TOLERANCE
IT'S A FASCINATING STORY
AND FOR THAT REASON IT WILL LIE FOREVER
AND PERHAPS RIGHTLY SO
LIKE POST TRAUMATIC STRESS
THAT'S WHERE THE FACTS
SO THAT'S WHY YOU GET INTRUSIVE MEMORIES
YOU GET NIGHTMARES AND FLASHBACKS
REALLY NOT FUNCTIONING
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE
TO TO HAVE TO DO THAT JOB
BUT WHEN WHEN THIS ISN'T WORKING PROPERLY
AND THAT'S WHEN I WENT
AND THAT'S REALLY
AND NOW HE'S GOT SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO ALL THE TIME
WE NEED TO FEEL WE HAVE SOME PURPOSE IN LIFE
THESE GUYS AND GIRLS
THEY FELT TRULY VALUED AS A TEAM
HE'S GOT HIS OWN SPECIAL PEN
HE HAS BEEN A SHOW GOAT
IT'S A VITAL PART OF OUR LIVES
ESPECIALLY AS THE HUNTERS' PRINCIPAL QUARRY
AND WE ALSO USE GOAT'S MILK IN OUR GOAT'S MILK SOAP
YOU ARE STIRRING THE FATS
ONE OF THEM WILL BE NAMED OUR WINNER
WE DECIDED THAT THE WINNER HAD TO BE SOMEONE WHO HAD OVERCOME A MAJOR CHALLENGE
BUT MALTA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY WHERE HUNTING THE BIRDS DURING THEIR SPRING MIGRATION IS STILL
SENT A DIFFERENCE OF JUST TWO
IS IT TIME THAT HUNTING WAS STOPPED ALTOGETHER
TO REDUCE THE LENGTH OF HUNTING SEASON
IT'S WORTH REMINDING EVERYBODY
THAT ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN PLANTED FOR A REASON
WE FELT THAT THE LAND WAS BEING FARMED VERY CONVENTIONALLY
AND WAS CERTAINLY NOT BEING USED IN THE WAY THAT LEONARD AND DOROTHY ELMURST HAD
AND IT'S IMPORTANT
WE THINK THE IDEA OF OF WHOLENESS
HE ROLLED ACROSS CENTRAL ASIA LIKE A SANDSTORM A CENTURY AFTER GENGHIS KHAN
FLAWED THOUGH IT WAS
AND LATER THAT VERY DAY
THOUSAND YEARS OLD WHEN GENGHIS KHAN DESTROYED IT
AND FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE HE ARRIVED
IT HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE PREVIOUS WAVE OF SILK ROAD CONQUERORS
ALEXANDER THE GREAT HAD BEEN HERE WHEN THE CITY WAS YOUNG
DOING WHAT THEY ALWAYS DID BEFORE THE NATURE OF THE SILK ROAD WASHED THEM AWAY
BEFORE REDUCING MOST OF THE CITY TO A SMOULDERING RUIN
ON THE SILK ROAD
IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY
SO WHEN THE CHRISTIAN WEST EVENTUALLY REDISCOVERED THESE ANCIENT IDEAS
IT WAS ON ARAB TRANSLATIONS THAT THEY DEPENDED
ONE OF THOSE PHILOSOPHERS BECAME PARTICULARLY FAMOUS
HIS NAME WAS IBN SINA
IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT THE VERY WORD RENAISSANCE
OR EVEN SIMPLY THE IDEA OF A RENAISSANCE
SUING FOR PEACE
THE BUILDINGS WERE ALL FOR SHOW
TO IMPRESS THE FOREIGN IDIOTS WHO KEPT COMING
WRINGING THEIR HANDS
AND IN DOING SO
THE FLIES TAKE REFUGE IN THE UNDERGROWTH
WHILE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES EAST OF THE SOMALIAN COAST
A WHITISH GLOW WAS OBSERVED ON THE HORIZON
AND AFTER FIFTEEN MINUTES OF STEAMING
UNDER THIS MICROSCOPE
I'VE GOT A DROP OF ORDINARY SEAWATER
THE WORLD OF ETERNAL DARKNESS
AND IT HAPPENS EVERY NIGHT IN EVERY OCEAN
IT'S A BIT OF A MESS
TWENTY FIVE AGAINST YOU ONLINE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
AND IF THEY WANT TO GET RID OF BOTH THESE THINGS
WHERE WE ARE NOW
AS A MAN OF SOME MEANS
THEN ACTUALLY GOES DOWN
PHIL HAD TO BUY SOMETHING SALVAGE
WELCOME TO A
THE SHOW WHERE A TEAM OF FIVE QUIZ CHALLENGERS PIT THEIR WITS AGAINST POSSIBLY THE GREATEST QUIZ
I'M BOBBY AND I'M A FREELANCE BOOKKEEPER
I'M AN ACCOUNTANT
I'M BILL AND I'M A RETIRED TEACHER
I WAS VERY SHOCKED WHEN HE DIED
AND ALL AT ONCE WAS SCARED TO DEATH
I WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST
SO I'LL GO FOR THAT ONE
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING TOWARDS
IT IS TIME FOR OUR FINAL ROUND AND
SO YOU WONDER WHY IT'S THERE
WE'LL GO FOR THAT
WE'LL BE BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE WATER
IT HAS A VERY SMALL CHARGE
BUT IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE ON THE TERMS OF THE SEAL
JUST BEFORE WE TAKE OUR FIRST QUESTION
IF YOU WANT TO BE AS THOUGH YOU WERE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE
SCRAPPING PRESCRIPTION CHARGES SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO PAY PRESCRIPTIONS SO
YOU'VE GOT FACEBOOK AND TWITTER
BUT THE QUESTION I WANT TO ADDRESS IS
JOINED SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH A CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT BROUGHT FORWARD THE MOST BRUTAL AND
LABOUR HAD HAD NINE YEARS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THEY WOULD CARRY OUT THE ROLE OF
THEY NEVER LAID A GLOVE ON THE SNP DURING THAT PERIOD
BUT SHE WASN'T TO HAVE IT HER OWN WAY AND
AFTER THE REFERENDUM
AND ESPECIALLY IN ABERDEEN
THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT THE ARGUMENT IS FOR SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE
THAT'S WHAT THEY ACHIEVED
VOTING CONSERVATIVE DENIED THE SNP A MAJORITY
I DON'T HATE YOUR PARTY
I JUST DISAGREE WITH IT
I FOUGHT THAT CAMPAIGN ON TRYING TO MOVE ON FROM THOSE REFERENDUM ARGUMENTS OF THE PAST
I BELIEVED THAT SCOTLAND WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD WHETHER WE WERE YES OR NO
THOUSAND FROM THE GENERAL ELECTION TO THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT ELECTION
THE IDEA OF ASKING THE RICHEST ONE PERCENT IN SCOTLAND TO PAY A BIT MORE TAX WE COULD PROTECT OUR PUBLIC
THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND LAST WEEK WHO VOTED LABOUR
WHO WERE PROUD TO CAMPAIGN ALONGSIDE MY PARTY TO STOP THE CUTS
I THINK THE ARGUMENTS AROUND TAX ARE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN WELL RECEIVED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO
THE ELECTION RESULT WAS NEARLY FORTY SEVEN PERCENT FOR THE SNP AND TWENTY TWO PERCENT FOR THE
SHE FARMED THE NO VOTE
WHEN WE GOT AN OVERALL MAJORITY IN THE SNP
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED THIS TIME AND IN FACT
THE SNP COULD NOT TURN THEIR SUPPORTERS OUT TO BACK NICOLA STURGEON AND RETURN THEM
NOT WITH A BIG C
SO YOU WILL FIND
WHICH I KNOW BEST
EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE GOT HANDS UP
IPSWICH THE WEEK AFTER THAT
THE ADDRESS TO APPLY IS THERE ON THE SCREEN AND
SAID IN SUPPORTING BREXIT THAT THE EU FAVOURS THE HAVES OVER THE HAVE NOTS
THEY HAVE BEEN VERY
THE WOMAN AT THE SECOND ROW FROM THE BACK
AND IF YOU LOOK BACK
IT'S A DIVERSION FROM THEIR INCOMPETENCE TO GOVERN
LAWS COMING THROUGH THAT ARE
HASN'T SET OUT FOR US EXACTLY WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO BE OUT WITH THE EU
WE WOULD STILL HAVE TO CONFORM TO ALL THE REGULATIONS AND THE GUIDELINES THAT GO WITH MAKING
I THINK THEY ARE NECESSARY
IT FAVOURS PEOPLE WHO CAN MAKE LARGE SYSTEMS WORK FOR THEM
NOT SMALL COMPANIES AND
I THINK THAT'S PARTLY WHAT HE WAS SAYING YEAH
I THINK IT PROBABLY IS TRUE TO A DEGREE
IT DELIVERS WORK
THE EU IS A POSITIVE FOR SCOTLAND
THERE ARE A LOT MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVIDING THESE SERVICES
IT BECOMES MORE COMPETITIVE
WE MAKE A DECISION
THEY SAY THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT
FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW
THEY ALL GO OUT TEN
THEY WEREN'T FORECASTING DEFLATION
THAT WE CAN ONLY TRADE WITH EUROPE
THAT WE CAN'T TRADE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD
A NUMBER OF FOLK HAVE SAID THAT THIS WOULD BE THE CASE
NIGEL LAWSON SAID
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THIS
THAT WERE THE EFFECT
IF THEY ARE NOT NEGOTIATING WELL
WHY SHOULD WE SAY
AND IF YOU REMEMBER
OF COURSE WE SAW
THAT SCOTTISH FISHING
THAT IS UTTERLY ATROCIOUS
THE NEXT GENERATION AND THE NEXT
BUT LET ME TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE
THAT MEANS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE WE JOINED THE EU
THE TONE OF THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN AWFUL
HAS BEEN HYPERBOLIC
IT'S NOT ANOTHER REFERENDUM ON WHETHER SCOTLAND LEAVES THE UK
I MEAN IN SOME RESPECTS
IMMACULATE PUBLIC SERVICE
I DON'T THINK SHE'S ASKING THEM HOW FAR THEY'VE COME
INSTEAD OF SAYING
OFFER ADVICE OR SUPPORT WHEN ASKED ABOUT EVERY CHILD
SO YOU HAVE A CHILD
YOU ALL KNOW THIS BUT
BUT OUTSIDE SCOTLAND
SO WHEN YOU START PUTTING MORE
THAT'S A PROBLEM
YOU'RE REDUCING THE ROLE OF THE PARENT OR THE FOSTER PARENT
SOME OF THE HYPERBOLE AROUND THIS
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT RURAL COMMUNITIES
ESPECIALLY LIKE THE HIGHLANDS
AND I SUPPORTED IT
I SUPPORTED THE SNP ON IT
I SUPPORTED THE PRINCIPLE OF THE NAMED PERSON
I STILL SUPPORT THE PRINCIPLE OF THE NAMED PERSON AND MY REASON FOR SO DOING IS BECAUSE CHILDREN'S
OR EVERY OTHER DAY DIRTY
PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND WANT THIS POLICY WITHDRAWN
REGARDLESS OF ANY ASSESSMENT OF THEIR VULNERABILITY AT ALL
WELLBEING HAS SEVERAL MEANINGS
THIS IS A WELL MEANING EYE
VERY SIMPLE SCHEME
THEY HAVE ONE POINT OF CONTACT
I'VE BEEN SPEEDING
I'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG
EVEN IF THEY'VE DONE NOTHING AT ALL
IF YOU STOP A CAR
THEY HAVE TO HAVE SHOWN SOME SIGN OF DOING SOMETHING WRONG
NOW THE NAMED PERSONS POLICY
WE SAW LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN TAKE FORWARD THE DECOMMISSIONING PROCESS
CONTRARY TO WHAT ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS SAID EARLIER
WE NOW GOT THE LEGISLATION THROUGH
HOW WE CAN GET MORE COLLABORATION
EDINBURGH AND DUNDEE ALTOGETHER DON'T COME NEAR IT
THE PRIME MINISTER WAS WAS HERE IN ABERDEEN EARLIER IN THE YEAR
LISTENING TO WHAT THE OIL INDUSTRY HAD TO SAY IN RELATION TO HOW THE
YOU CAN'T RELY ON THIS
SO YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE IN SCOTLAND IS TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO BOOST THE ECONOMY
YOU HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO REPLACE THE JOBS
YOU CAN ONLY OFFER TAX CUT WHEN COMPANIES ARE MAKING A PROFIT
THERE WAS CAPITAL TO BE EMPLOYED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS PARTLY OVERCOME
WE WILL STEP UP AND
IT HAS GONE FAST
UNTIL NEXT WEEK
AND THERE'S THE ADDRESS ON THE SCREEN
I'VE GOT THE WRONG TELEPHONE I
SO YOU CAN FOLLOW THE ARGUMENTS THERE
BUT AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED IN ABERDE
WE'VE GOT YVETTE COOPER FOR LABOUR
WE'VE GOT YOU AMBER RUDD FOR THE TORIES
SO THERE WE ARE
IF YOU'RE LISTENING ON RADIO FIVE LIVE
AS YOU WELL KNOW
I'VE BEEN TO SOME VERY INTERESTING PLACES
AND YOU JUST HAPPENED TO KNOCK IT WITH YOUR GEOLOGICAL HAMMER
WHICH HAPPENED TO BE AROUND AT THE TIME
ISN'T THAT THE MOST ROMANTIC THING EVER
I CERTAINLY FIND IT SO
WHEN I WAS A BOY
YOU SEE THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHELL OF A SIMPLY ENORMOUS ONE
I DO BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED IN THEM AND IT GIVES ME A HUGE PLEASURE AND I THINK OTHER PEOPLE CAN
HOW COULD THEY BE
THEY SAID THAT BACK IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY
BUT DISCOVERED THAT THE PLACE WAS INFESTED BY SNAKES
SHE TURNED THEM ALL TO STONE
THERE'S ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT EXPLANATION
REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT
SO THE NEXT SEASON
SEE A DEAD WOLF OR SOMETHING AND THINK THERE'S A MEAL
ONE OF THE MOST RECENT DEPOSITS OF EXTINCT ANIMALS IS IN CALIFORNIA
OUTSIDE LOS ANGELES
THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR FORTY
AND TO MAKE A PROGRAMME
ABOUT FOSSILS AND NOT TO MENTION DINOSAURS
TO ACTUALLY DO A PROGRAM ABOUT DINOSAURS IN WHICH YOU DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE RECONSTRUCTION
AND THAT YOU TRIED TO BRING THE ANIMALS TO LIFE IN PEOPLE'S IMAGINATIONS BY SIMPLY LOOKING
SO NOW IT SEEMS WE HAVE TO THINK OF BRACHOSAURUS AS A KIND OF GIGANTIC REPTILIAN
FLOWERING PLANTS DIDN'T DEVELOP UNTIL ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO
THE BIGGEST OF ALL THE MEAT EATING DINOSAURS
MEASURING OVER FORTY FEET LONG AND WEIGHING ABOUT SEVEN TONNES
AS REPTILES DO TODAY
THAT IS A QUESTION OF GREAT DEBATE
LACKING IN TEETH
THE SKULLS OF ALL HADROSAURS ARE VERY MUCH THE SAME
BUT SLIGHTLY SMALLER
SO IT'S PROBABLY A FEMALE
PERHAPS EVEN MORE SURPRISINGLY
IN THE DARKNESS
THE PLANTS ALL DIED
UNLESS I'M GREATLY MISTAKEN
PRESENTS WHO SHE IS
AND WITH HER LEGS UP
FEELING SORRY FOR HERSELF
I CAN'T GO TO HOLLYWOOD
SHE WAS A BIG BAND SINGER OF COURSE
AND HER SINGING STYLE WAS
AND SHE WAS A KIND OF GIRL NEXT DOOR CHIPPER
THAT IT REALLY AFFECTED HER SINGING AND SHE WAS CRYING AND VERY UPSET
SHE ENDED UP DANCING BEAUTIFULLY IN MANY FILMS AFTER THAT
AND WHICH I THINK STANDS UP VERY WELL AND
AND WHEN SHE BEGAN TO SING
BUT NEVER FORGET THAT DAY
SHE CHOSE COMPLETE DIFFERENT FILMS
SHE IS A LITTLE PASSIVE
SHE GETS TO THE OPERA HOUSE AND DOESN'T MOVE
BUT SHE'S HAD TO LEAVE THE STAGE
AND HE WOULD TALK HER INTO IT
SO HE WAS A SVENGALI
AND ALSO WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THAT IS SHE RISES ABOVE JUST THE SIMPLE INTEREST OF A MOTHER TRYING TO
THEY PAY THEIR TUITION
SO IN A BID TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
AND WE'D GO IN AT NOON AND WE'D STAY THERE UNTIL SIX O'CLOCK
SO WE'D GET TO SEE THE MOVIE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR TIMES
AND THEN THE NEXT SATURDAY
I LOVE BEING A SINGLE WOMAN AND
THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN A SINGLE WOMAN IS IS ONE WHO CLAIMS TO ENJOY BEING A SINGLE WOMAN
SO BUT THE FACT IS
THERE WASN'T ANY DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO END UP DOING THAT I WAS GOING TO GO
SHE WAS ALREADY A GOOD TEN YEARS AHEAD OF HER TIME
A WOMAN HAS THE RIGHT TO IT ALL
TO BE THE BEST AT WHAT SHE'S DOING
WE HAD A WONDERFUL
THEY WANT TO WORK
BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS ON TIME
KNOW WHATEVER IT IS
TO HIDE THE CREEPING PUCKER
THE OLD DORIS DAY IS JUST TOO STRONG AN IMAGE NOT TO BE PEEPING THROUGH THAT AND I THINK IT WOULD
AND THE RUMOURS ABOUT HER FIRING CAMERAMEN
WHATEVER HAPPENED BETWEEN THEM
LIVES OUT OF TRASH CANS
CARY GRANT THEY WERE SO POPULAR
NOT TO GET CARRIED AWAY WITH SENT
YOU NEED TO FOCUS JUST THE SAME AS IF YOURE DOING COLOUR
SO TRY AND SELECT WHAT YOU LIKE
IT'S IT'S NOT SO OBVIOUS AS AH AS THIS SORT OF SET PIECE ROOM
THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THEM TO BUY
YOU CAN SEE HERE
GREEN AND WHITE GARDEN
AND THAT'S MUCH MORE INTERESTING
WOULD SHE HAVE ARRIVED AT THE SAME DECISION
I THINK YOU WOULD
SUPPORTED BY POSTS
OR NETTING OF ANY KIND
AND IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE SUPPORT
SHE STARTS OUT WITH THOSE BORDERS
IF THAT'S THE CASE
EVEN IF YOU'VE ALREADY PLANTED YOUR SWEET PEAS OR
FOR SOME STRANGE REASON
YOU DON'T WANT TO PLANT SWEET PEAS
GREEN GRASS AND SHRUBBERY AROUND THAT THE ELEPHANTS ABSOLUTELY LOVE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
WHETHER IT IS JUST THE FOLIAGE
ONE OF THE LAST OF HIS KIND
AND IF THEY MANAGE TO SURVIVE OUT THERE
WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATES AS DICE BOX
THEY WERE BORN SIX WEEKS AGO
AND IN THE WILD
A BIRD WOULD ROLL ITS EGGS SO THAT THE EMBRYO DOESN'T STICK TO THE SIDE OF THE SHELL
IT WASN'T PERFECT AIR SUPPORT
SHE'S MOVING AGAIN AND
THE ONCE IMMACULATE ESTATE HAD FALLEN INTO DECLINE AND THE FOURTH DUKE OF SUTHERLAND TRIED AND
MOST OF TRENTHAM HALL WAS DEMOLISHED
THEY'RE NOT JUST MAKING
SO IT'S GOT ACTUALLY A BIT OF A POLITICAL MEANING
IT WAS BOUGHT BY OWNERS WITH AN AMBITION TO RESTORE IT TO ITS FORMER GLORY
VERY INTERESTING SUBJECT
AND WE'VE GOT A FRAMED NEWSPAPER
IF WE LOOK AT THIS
BUT THEY ARE VERY
THE ONES OF HIM AND OTHER PRIZE FIGHTERS
IT COULD HAVE EITHER BENT
FROM TIME TO TIME
HE WAS A MOVIE MAKER HIMSELF
THE INTERESTING THING IS
WHERE THEY CAME FROM
BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE HERE
WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR YOU
I THINK WE'D BE LOOKING AT BETWEEN TWO AND
WE SAW THIS IN A LOCAL AUCTION ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO AND THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THE PIECE
BUT THERE WAS ALSO
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT
APART FROM ITS SIZE AND AND GRANDEUR
WAS THE TECHNICAL ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF STEVENS WILLIAMS
THEY WERE MAJOR
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO GO ON DO INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE
NICK ALL THEIR BEST IDEAS
IN THE ART NOUVEAU PERIOD
AND THEY LOOK JUST LIKE THAT
AND I THINK THIS LITTLE PICTURE
AND IN TERMS OF VALUE
FOR THIS GORGEOUS
LOVELY COLOURFUL PICTURE
BOTH STRATEGIES INVOLVED A SIZEABLE RISK
BY SIDING WITH THE ROMANS
AND THAT WAS WITH THE HELP OF ROME
BUT CERTAINLY IT'S SYMMETRICAL
EVERYONE WOULD RECOGNISE AT ONCE
EVEN IN EPHESUS
WITH THE VAST RESERVES OF WEALTH THE CITY HAD TO OFFER
WE CAN SOLVE THE MYSTERY BEYOND DOUBT OF WHO THIS SKELETON ACTUALLY IS
MURDERED ON THE SACRED GROUND OF THE HOLY TEMPLE OF ARTEMIS
THESE ARE ALL PARTS OF A CODE
THEN IN MARC ANTONY
YOU ARE A MAGNIFICENT WOMAN
I LIKE TO TRY IT ON TO SEE IF IT FITS
I KNOW THEY CALL IT BASIC CONSTRUCTION WEEK
THE SEWERS HAVE TO THINK FAST AND THEY HAVE TO SO FAST AS THEY REAM SOMETHING OLD AND SORT OF
WHERE I'VE COME FROM
I'M GOING TO BE TRAVELLING THAT SOUTHERN BRANCH OF THE SILK ROAD
IT WAS THROUGH THEM THAT CHINA REACHED OUT TO THE PERSIAN EMPEROR
VIOLENT AND MERCILESS
WHEN HE LOOTED THE TREASURY
OR EVEN WHEN HE LIVED
BUT HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PROPHETS TO OFFER A SINGLE OMNIPOTENT AND INVISIBLE
THE FAITHFUL WERE COMMANDED TO PRAY TO AHHUA MAZDA IN THE DIRECTION OF THE LIGHT
BUT THE ONLY LIGHT THAT THE ANCIENTS CONTROLLED WAS FIRE
IT'S SAID THAT THE FLAME IN HERE HAS BEEN BURNING FOR OVER
ONE THAT WOULD CHANGE THE SILK ROAD
THEY CERTAINLY LIKE MIXING THINGS UP IN IRAN
IF I SPOKE ANY LOUDER
SCIENTISTS HAVE ACTUALLY MEASURED SOME FORTY NINE DISTINCT ECHOES HERE
THE ONLY ISLAMIC RULER IN IRAN TO BE BESTOWED THE TITLE OF GREATNESS
AND HE HAD QUITE AN ECLECTIC FAN BASE
THE FAMED MONGOL WARRIOR
EIGHT PEOPLE WORKING ON IT EVERY DAY FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
BOTH OLD AND NEW
IT WAS ALSO A SYMBOL OF WEALTH AND POWER
HE HAD THE WHOLE OF THE BEDCHAMBER
THEY CONTROLLED THE SEA LANES OF THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
THE KIND OF TERRAIN TO EXPECT
HOW MUCH FOOD TO PACK
MARCO POLO'S TRAVELS REVEALED A NEW WORLD OF COMMERCIAL LINKS THAT REACHED AS FAR AS PERSIA
THIS IS THE BOOK THAT FIRST REVEALED EAST TO WEST
IT'S A TRAVEL GUIDE TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF MERCHANTS
WITH DETAILS OF DIRECTIONS
COME RAIN OR SUN
THE PIO SAN MARCO NEVER FAILS TO IMPRESS
SOME PEOPLE ARE LONG SIGHTED
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE NOWADAYS
WHICH I THINK WAS AN F
AND IF YOU ARE THINKING OF RED
YOU ARE STILL STANDING
SHE WILL THEN BE FULFILLING HER DREAM IN A TRULY AMAZING
SHOW STOPPING PERFORMANCE AT THE END OF THE SHOW
BUT RIGHT NOW SHE'S ON HER WAY TO THE THEATRE WITH A BUNCH OF FLOWERS
COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS TO HOW THAT'S GOING TO PLAY OUT
WE HAVE NOT HAD A RESPONSE LIKE WE'VE HAD TO THIS DREAM TEXT
WHEN SHE DOES COME THROUGH THE DOOR
GIVE HER THE MAXIMUM
THE WEIRDEST PART
I THINK IT MEANS YOU'RE POSSIBLY OVERWORKING
I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT THIS MESSAGE
AND THEN HE PUT
AFTER JUST A COUPLE OF NIGHTS OF NOT SLEEPING PROPERLY
NOT EATING PROPERLY AND BEGGING FOR MONEY
UM BUT IT WAS THE HARDEST THING
THAT I THINK I'VE EVER DONE
COP WHERE WOULD YOU TURN
IF YOU WERE TRYING TO GET BACK ON YOUR FEET
CLOTHES AND TOILETRIES FOR ANYBODY TURNING UP AT A HOSTEL WITH NOTHING
A CENTRAL AREA OFF WHICH ALL THE DIFFERENT ROOMS SPREAD
IT'S A FAIRLY TOGETHER
UM BUT AT THE BACK HERE
IT JUST ADDS TO THE PROPERTY
AND POUNDS AND ON THE RENTAL MARKET
WITH THAT REALLY ATTRACTIVE GUIDE PRICE
THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE OR A NICE HOME TO BE BOUGHT
LET'S SEE WHO AGREED WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
MAYBE BUILDING A GARAGE WOULD BE A SENSIBLE THING TO DO
WE MIGHT TAKE A WALL OUT
THEN WE'LL JUST SEE WHICH WHETHER WE GET THIS ONE SOLD
I SHOULD IMAGINE
BUT ONE THING FOR SURE
IF THAT GOES OVER
THERE'S A WORKING BARBERSHOP
ON THE GROUND FLOOR
AND WHOEVER BUYS IT
AH SO MONEY'S COMING IN STRAIGHT THE WAY
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE MONEY WELL SPENT
LET'S SEE WHO WANTED IT WHEN YOU WENT UNDER THE HAMMER
IT'S EASY TO HAVE A LOOK AT THEM AND THEN EASY FOR MAINTENANCE FILE AS WELL
AND I'M CONCENTRATING MORE ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE
AND THIS PROPERTY WAS ALLENTED
I WAS IN THE NAVY
HE KINDLY OFFERED ME
I DO THE PROPERTY
SO IF YOU WANT TO JOIN IN
TAKE OUT THE BATH AND PUT A SHOWER THERE
I'M QUITE HANDYMAN MYSELF AS WELL
REALLY VERY GOOD
SO I THINK WE ALL WILL CHIP IN AND HOPEFULLY GET THIS PROPERTY GOING VERY QUICK
BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES
WE'RE OK WITH THAT
I'M GOING TO GET THE ROOFER IN AND MAKE SURE THAT THE TILES ARE SORTED BECAUSE THE WEATHER IS
BUT I WOULD I WAS READY TO GO UP TO HUNDRED THOUSAND
BECAUSE WHEN I WENT TO THE PROPERTY I THOUGHT
THE TIME WISE ON THIS ONE
BECAUSE I THINK
I'M HOLDING BACK THIS FLAT FOR
AND I'M EXPECTING THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PO FOR THE FLAT
PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING
AND WHEN THEY'RE WORKING
THIS PROJECT WILL BE A DONALD
AND WITH HIS NAVAL HISTORY
I'M SURE HE'LL TAKE COMMAND OF THE SITUATION
WE DIDN'T EXPECT TO SPEND THAT MUCH
I WOULD VALUE THIS PROPERTY AT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND
BUT THE GUIDE PRICE FOR THE AUCTION LOT I'M HERE TO SEE WAS NINETY TO NINETY FIVE
THIS IS A GREAT STREET
BECAUSE YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY FIELDS AND PARKS
IT'S GOING TO HAVE THREE STORIES AND FOUR BEDROOMS
IF YOU DO GO DOWN THIS ROUTE
THEN THE FOUNDATIONS WILL HAVE TO BE EXPOSED AND CHECKED TO ENSURE THEY'RE SUITABLE FOR AN
THE ROUTE YOU DECIDE TO TAKE WILL BE DICTATED BY BUILDING REGULATIONS AND THE CONDITION OF
THE ONLY THING I MAY DO IS CONSIDER ADDING A CONSERVATORY AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE
BECAUSE I KNEW HOW MUCH PROPERTY WAS WORTH ROUND HERE
IT'S WITHIN BUDGET
SHARE THE INFORMATION
THAT'S TO DO EVERYTHING
THEN WE'VE GOT CONTINGENCY FOR IT
I'M NOT THINKING THAT WE'LL CHANGE VERY MUCH
IT'S ALL THOSE EXTRAS
YEAH THAT THEY CAN ADD ON THAT END UP
BUT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY
POUND AT TODAY'S VALUES
AS FAR AS RENTAL IS CONCERNED
THIS IS AN AUCTION LOT WITH MORE POTENTIAL THAN IT SEEMED AT FIRST GLANCE
I'M SURE THERE WILL BE CHALLENGES ALONG THE WAY
BUT BUY THIS IN THIS POPULAR SPOT
THERE'S NO CLEARANCE REQUIRED
APART FROM THAT
EVERYTHING JUST WENT ON SCHEDULE AS WE PLANNED
CLEARLY MONEY WELL SPENT
I KNOW FOR A FACT IT WILL FLY OUT
AND HE OFFERED ME THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE
WHICH I'VE ACCEPTED
THAT THEY SHOULD DO IT BUT
AH BEFORE DOING THAT
THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF YOU KNOW ON ON HAND EXPERIENCE JOINING
AND IT WILL BE DEFINITELY WORTH IT BUT
IT'S GOING TO HAVE THREE STORIES AND FOUR BEDROOMS
SO THEN WE HAD TO SUBMIT ANOTHER PLAN
WHITE EMULSION WALLS ARE VERY IN KEEPING WITH THE CURRENT TREND
I WOULD SAY THEY SHOULD ACHIEVE A FIGURE IN THE REGION OF THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY
THREE TWENTY FIVE WOULD BE REALLY
IS IS VERY NECESSARY
WE WOULD HAVE BOTH SAID NO
WE WOULD WE WOULDN'T DO IT AGAIN
IS ON THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR SO
IN ORDER TO CREATE MORE OF A FAMILY TYPE HOME
HE'S BEEN VERY TACTICAL
IF MY CHAIR BOMBS
I WAS SORT OF THINKING TEN OR TWENTY
WHICH IS A LENS
AND THE LENS HAS A PRINT ON THE BACK
WHICH IS FLYING IN THE SHOW TODAY
AND BUT THEY ACTUALLY ARE
AT FIFTEEN POUNDS WE'VE GOT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
BUT ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE
SHE GETS REALLY EXCITED
THEY GET REALLY EXCITED
WE SHOULD GET YOU
EVERY BIT AS COMPLEX THAT WE ARE ONLY NOW BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND
IT'S SOMETHING THAT NATURE HAS BEEN HARNESSING FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS
IT'S THE MOST TRANSFORMATIVE
THANKS TO THE RICH AND FASHIONABLE ARISTOCRATS AND BANKERS WHO LIVED THERE
IT WOULD BECOME HOME TO THE GREATEST SILK WEAVING INDUSTRY IN THE WORLD
ALMOST A THIRD OF THE CITY'S INHABITANTS WORKED IN THE SILK INDUSTRY
THAT IS CONTAINED IN THE INFORMATION
WHICH IS ENCODED ON THE CARDS
IT WAS DEVELOPED BY ARTIST AND ENTREPRENEUR SAMUEL MORSE
TOGETHER WITH HIS COLLEAGUE ALFRED VALE
EACH CUNNING AND INNOVATIVE IN ITS OWN WAY
WERE ALL DESTINED FOR THE SCRAP HEAP OF HISTORY
WAS AS COMPLICATED AS FIGURING OUT THE HARDWARE SIDE OF THINGS WITH THE BATTERIES AND THE AND THE WIRES AND
PROCESS AND TRANSMIT INFORMATION
WHAT HAD BEGUN WITH THE INVENTION OF WRITING THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO HAD CULMINATED IN THE
FOR PEOPLE AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT MAY HAVE SEEMED THAT HUMANITY'S ABILITY TO
INFORMATION WOULD REVEAL ITSELF TO BE A MORE IMPORTANT
HE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A RESOLUTION
IT MAY SOUND FAR FETCHED AND FANCIFUL BUT
WHILE MAXWELL'S RIDDLE RUMBLED ON
SOMETHING QUITE UNEXPECTED WAS TO HAPPEN
THIS WAS A DEVICE THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE BUILT
AND THE IDEA BEHIND IT CAME FROM A QUITE REMARKABLE AND VISIONARY SCIENTIST
ABSTRUSE RESEARCH IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF MATHEMATICS COULD PRODUCE ANYTHING OF ANY PRACTICAL VALUE
LET ALONE A MACHINE THAT WAS GOING TO CHANGE THE LIVES OF
I WANT TO TRY AND INVENT THE MODERN COMPUTER
HE WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS VERY ABSTRACT PROBLEM IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF MATHEMATICS
AND THE COMPUTER KIND OF FELL SIDEWAYS OUT OF THAT RESEARCH
THE TITLE MAY SOUND A BIT DRY
HE SHOWED THAT ANY MESSAGE YOU CARED TO SEND COULD BE TRANSLATED INTO BINARY
FAR REACHING THEORY
THE IDEAS HE BEGAN TO EXPLORE WOULD FORM THE CORNERSTONE OF WHAT WE NOW CALL
HE'D TAKEN AN ABSTRACT CONCEPT INFORMATION AND TURNED IT INTO SOMETHING TANGIBLE
EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION WE'VE EVER CREATED
AND THAT'S BECAUSE EVEN THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT EVENT CONTAINS A SPECTACULAR
AT SOME POINT THE NE IS GOING TO HAVE TO ERASE IT
THAT'S AN IRREVERSIBLE PROCESS THAT INCREASES THE ENTROPY OF THE UNIVERSE
INFORMATION IS CARRIED BY SOMETHING
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR THAT CREATING PHYSICAL ORDER THE STRUCTURES WE SEE AROUND US HAS A COST
EVERY ASPECT OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS A BLANK CANVAS
BUT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS
WE'VE LEARNT THAT ORDERING INFORMATION
CREATING THE INVISIBLE
DIGITAL STRUCTURES OF THE MODERN WORLD
I FIND THIS AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING IDEA
EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY
THE THING THAT CARRIED SPUTNIK INTO SPACE
I'VE GOT THIRTY ON IT
AND MY ABSOLUTE BOTTOM
WHAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP FARMERS LIKE JAMES
BUT WHEN OUR FARMERS DO MANAGE TO GROW THEIR CROPS UNSCATHED
IT MEANS THAT WE
APART FROM THAT LEG WOULD HAVE A THIN LAYER OF FAT IF IT WAS ONE OF MY
THAT THE PREPARATIONS FOR THEM START RIGHT NOW IN SPRING
THESE CHICKS WILL BE RAISED OUTSIDE UNTIL THEY REACH TABLE WEIGHT IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS
YOU'D LIKE TO HELP SWELL THE DWINDLING NUMBER OF BRITISH BEES
SENT TO THE CAMPS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WHEN THE PIPES EMPTIED
THE CONSEQUENCES OF PEOPLE DYING EARLY
NOBODY DIED IN NOTTINGHAM
THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL VISIT
LET ME SHOW YOU OVER HERE
I BACK IN TEN SECONDS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE WILL HELPED EACH OTHER
AND THAT SHOWS YOU WHAT LEVEL OF DETAIL THEY LIVE THEIR LIVES BY AND THEREFORE WE HAVE TO REPLICATE
ONE FUEL UNIT IS AS MUCH AS YOUR HOUSE
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT
I GIVE UP MY JOB TO BE HERE
IF THAT EVER HAPPENED
I'M ACTUALLY HERE IN THE CRC AND
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE DOING IT
AND IT READS HERE
A FRIEND THAT HE MADE
WHO BECAME HIS BEST FRIEND
I HAD EIGHTY IN MIND
MY FATHER WAS A HUGE INFLUENCE BUT HE REALLY LIKED THE HYBRID TEAS
OUR CLASSIC OLD ROSES ARE GOING THE OTHER WAY AND UNLESS WE CAN GET THE NEW GENERATION OF GARDENERS
BUT WE ALSO DID LOTS OF GARDEN VISITS AS A FAMILY
SO WHY DO YOU FEEL IT'S WORTH GROWING
THE PERFUME IS INCREDIBLE
BUT SO IDEALLY YOU JUST PRUNE THEM
I THINK IT'S MORE FOR THE CONNOISSEUR
BUT I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU
PUT IN NARCISSI OR ALLIUMS SO THAT YOU REALLY EXTEND THE SEASON OF INTEREST AND THE OTHER
IF YOU'RE GOING FOR AN OLD ROSE OFTEN YOU'LL FIND MORE VARIETY OUT OF SEASON AND THEN THEY ARRIVE
THEY'RE FAR TOO GOOD TO LET SLIP THROUGH OUR FINGERS AND NO BRITISH GARDEN SHOULD BE WITHOUT ONE
WHICH WAS TO TAKE AN INAPPROPRIATE PLANT OUT OF A TREE
THEY OFFER SO MUCH
SO IT KEEPS THE STONE COOL IN THE SUMMER AND ALSO WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
IN UNIVERSITY LIFE
IT'S CALLED CONSTANCE ELIOTT
BUT THIS HAS GOT A DIFFERENT FLOWER
THIS IS SIXTY YEARS OLD
WHILE SHE KEEPS TRYING
GET RIGHT AWAY FROM IT
THAT'S GOOD FUN
AND WE REALLY DID NOT GET ONE
WHETHER IT BE ON THE COAST
ONE IN THE COUNTRY
ONE IN THE CITY AND ONE ON THE COAST
EACH WITH AN OFFER OF A JOB AND A BRAND NEW WAY OF LIFE FOR THEM TO ENJOY ON THEIR BUDGET
SO FIFTEEN MINUTE DRIVE
IT'S GOT TO BE RIGHT
AND REVEAL THEIR SECRETS IN A WAY THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE
BUT ALSO INTO THEIR BEHAVIOUR
THE FIRST PART USES A NETWORK OF SATELLITES TO CALCULATE ITS LOCATION
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT OUR COLLARED ZEBRA
THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE BACK IN THE FLOODPLAIN
A DRIVE TO EXPLORE AND TO NAVIGATE
IN FIBERGLASS THREE WHEELERS
HEAD TO HEAD WITH CHRIS
BUT IT WAS ALSO NOT A GOOD CAR
THE PHI
IT'S VERY MUCH ABOUT THE
OR WHATEVER IT WAS
SHE MADE IT REALLY VERY
BECAUSE THEY WOULD COME
THEY WOULD LOOK AND
AND THEY WOULD FEEL SHOCKED
AND ON THEIR THIRD OR FOURTH VISIT
THEY WOULD BUY THEM
I WAS ACTUALLY HORRIFIED
AND I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
JUST ABOUT EVERYONE HAS DREAMT OF BEING IN A BAND AT SOME POINT
SOME OF US HAVE BEEN DOING IT SINCE OUR TEENS WITH MIXED RESULTS
WE ALL CARED PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE MUSIC WE WERE PLAYING
BUT IT CAN ALSO BE A VERY DESTRUCTIVE THING
WHAT ARE THESE DESTRUCTIVE FORCES THAT BLOW A BAND APART AND WHAT ARE THE SECRETS OF STAYING
I'VE BEEN IN LOADS OF BRILLIANT BANDS SINCE I WAS A KID AND YET REMAIN MYSTIFYINGLY UNAPPRECIATED
SOMEBODY COMES BACK WITH A FRESH PERSPECTIVE
THOSE DAYS HAVE GONE
THE WHOLE WORLD IS STANDING AT THE BACK DOOR OF THE STUDIO
CAN THIS BE A FORCE FOR GOOD
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE THREE OR FOUR MELLOW GUYS BECOMING A GREAT BAND
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TOO AGREEABLE
DRINK AND DRUGS HAVE BEEN THE FUEL OF THE BAND LIFESTYLE
IT'S JUST A HIGH
MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR A VERY LONG TIME
I KNOW WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN MATES BUT
I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH YOU ANYMORE
I KNOW YOU'RE MY BROTHER
PERHAPS YOU'RE IN LOVE
BUT I HAVE ALWAYS RESENTED YOU
EVEN BETTER IF YOU'RE MARRIED
F YOU AND YOU AND YOU AND YOU AND YOU
ISAAC NEWTON AND STEVE JOBS BELONGS
BUT STEVIE WAS NEVER A REAL NEGATIVE PERSON
RIGHT THROUGH TO THAT FINAL PERFORMANCE ON A ROOFTOP IN SAVILLE ROW
IT WAS JUST SIX YEARS
BUT FROM THAT ALL TOO BRIEF CAREER
THEIR SPECTACULAR SUCCESS AND DRAMATIC COLLAPSE
THEY SET THE TEMPLATE FOR SO MANY BANDS
THE BEATLES EXITED THE ROOF OF THE APPLE BUILDING AND ENTERED THE HISTORY BOOKS
AND YET SOMEHOW THEIR CLOSEST RIVALS
WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE NOW
THE ROLLING STONES
MANAGED TO HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER
DESPITE THE SAME PRESSURES OF SUPERSTARDDOM AND ONE MEMBER WHO THOUGHT OF HIMSELF VERY MUCH AS THE
WHAT'S THE DEAL
TWO PEOPLE WHO COME UP WITH ALL THE SONGS
AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT SOMETIMES
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CITY
WHAT I'M SAYING IS WHAT'S IT LIKE WHEN YIN AND YANG CAN'T STAND THE SIGHT OF EACH OTHER
IT JUST ALL BECOMES TOO MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN THOSE FAMILIAR TENSIONS BETWEEN THE LEAD SINGER AND THE LEAGUE GUITARIST BECOME TOO MUCH TO BEAR
BROKEN HEARTED THAT HE COULDN'T GET OUT THAT DOOR
IT'S TOO FAST OR IT'S TOO SLOW OR IT'S TOO HIGH OR IT'S TOO LOW
TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE DOOR
THE BAND IS OVER
WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO HAVE A BAND IF THIS IS HOW YOU'RE GOING TO BEHAVE
YOU HAVE TO APPEAR
YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP
IT'S NOT JUST YOUR BAND
IF YOU DON'T COME OUT OF THIS DOOR NOW
LIKE I'M BREAKING UP
THIS IS WHERE I WANT THEM LIKE
THEY NEVER VERBALISE THEIR PROBLEMS
NOBODY EVER GETS THEM IN A ROOM AND SAYS
WE PROBABLY WERE A BIT MISERABLE BACK THEN
BUT THE LEGACY LIVES ON
I COULD SAY THE SAME TO THEM
LIKE OWNERSHIP OF THE NAME
AND THEN THERE'S THE BACK CATALOGUE
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN RIVAL EX MEMBERSERS WANT TO TOUR
DOING THE SAME SONGS
I'M NOT HAVING YOU USING IT
THAT'S WHEN THINGS CAN GET REALLY MESSY
OR IS IT THE STADIUM GIGS
THE NEW GREATEST HITS ALBUM
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT
IT'S THE LEAD SINGER
PERHAPS IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THE BUSINESS STARTED TO CREATE ITS OWN BANDS
PARTICULARLY IN NINETY S BRITAIN
THIS WAS THE ERA OF NEW LABOUR AND FOCUS GROUPS
AND MANUFACTURED BANDS REALLY CAUGHT THE ZEITGEIST
THIS IS BBC FOUR
WE CAN CONFIDENTLY USE WORDS LIKE ZEITGEIST
BUT WHATEVER THOSE BANDS WERE DOING
EVERYONE'S GETTING ON WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO AND EVERYONE'S AIMING TO GET TO THE TOP OF
THEY WERE CERTAINLY DOING SOMETHING RIGHT
IT WAS THE TIPPING POINT FOR HIM
AS WE ALL REMEMBER
BUT NEITHER LINE UP PROVED AS RESILIENT AS THEIR CREATORS WERE HOPING FOR
AND PERHAPS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SHARED HISTORY
IF YOU DON'T HAVE LONG STANDING FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS
SOME KIND OF FRACTURE IS ALMOST INEVITABLE
WE DON'T WANT TO FINISH THIS FILM ON A DOWNER
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT
AS FAR AS I KNOW
ALL DOOM AND GLOOM
CERTAINLY THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO
IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE ALL THE FUN AND ALL THE SUCCESS AND THEN JUST PART WHEN YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH AS
LOOKING BACK OVER THE WHOLE THING
THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE
NOT EVERYONE CAN BE THIS GOOD
IN THE OLDEN DAYS
WHY DID YOU TELL THEM THAT
CHARTERING A SPECIAL TRAIN
BUT SHE WASN'T ADMITTED TO HIS PRESENCE AND NEWSREEL RECORDS HOW SHE RANTED AND RAVED ON THE
WITH A POPULATION OF ONE
AND THIS VERY ROOM
RECOMMENDED IN MY BRADSHAW'S GUIDE
VIOLENCE ON THE STREETS
DEMANDING HIS ABDICATION
BECAUSE A DELEGATION FROM PARLIAMENT COMES OUT TO MEET HIM
BOY WHO DIED IN A RAILWAY STATION
SAY HE WOULD HAVE LEFT IT OVERNIGHT
LAST TIME AT TEN
WHO WOULD'VE LIVED HERE
YOUR MAIDEN BID
WHAT ABOUT EIGHT ON THAT
THEY ALL START IN TEN
FIVE AND EVERYTHING
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AN OFFICER ACCORDING TO THE MANUAL OF MILITARY LAW
EVERY TIME I GET REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT WAS THE BOOK
THAT WAS THE ONE THAT THAT MADE HIM FAMOUS AND THAT HAS GONE ON TO BE SO INCREDIBLY WELL
IT'S ON THE THAT
PROSPERITY FOR BRITISH AIRWAYS AND FOR OUR CUSTOMERS
THEY GET ON BOARD AN A PLATEE AND WE TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN'T SMOKE
THEY CAN'T USE THE MOBILE PHONES
AH NEED TO PUT THE SEAT UPRIGHT
FIRST AND BUSINESS CLASS
TRYING TO GET THEM TO COME WITH YOU
THEY GUIDE A COMPANY WITH TWENTY
AND THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO DIVERT INTO ORLANDO OR MIAMI WHICH
JUST REASSURE THEM
UM SHARE INFORMATION WITH THEM
WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT
AS I WOULD SAY TO ANYONE YOU KNOW
NOT NECESSARILY BUY SOMETHING FROM ME
THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE
IN ORDER TO STIMULATE ME
I DON'T SEE THE POINT
AND THEN I CAN'T HAMMER STRAIGHT NAILS
THE HIGHWAYS AND THE BYWAYS
ON THE SAME LEVEL
DO THEY NOT WANT TO
ARE THEY GOING TO BARK
DO THEY WANT ONE PIECE OR FIVE PIECES
VERY HARD TO READ
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS
THE TWO CLASSES FROM JAPAN
WOULD YOU LIKE THEM TO STAY
AND WHOEVER'S COMING HERE TONIGHT IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO PLAY A LARGE PART IN WHETHER I CAN CONTINUE
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING FOR
I JUST HOPE THEY'VE GOT A FEW BOB ON THEM AND THAT THEY LIKE GREGG'S WORK
THAT'S ALL I'M INTERESTED IN
I'M AFRAID THIS IS NOT A DAY FOR LEVITY
FIRST ONE TO TEN GETS
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
BUT IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE IT WON'T SURVIVE DINNER
WHY ARE YOU STOPPING IN THE MIDDLE OF A BRIDGE
AND BECAUSE OF HIM THEN
ONCE IT WAS DISCOVERED
WHAT WHAT WAS THAT LIKE
TO GO TO THE STATES
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF
BUT THERE' ONLY TWO THINGS
WHERE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WOULD HAVE TRAVELLED ALONG WITH THE OFFICERS
HE WAS EXHAUSTED
BUT HE DECLINED
AND THEN SLAM THE GLASS DOWN ON THE TABLE IN UNISON
THAT'S THE TERM
IS A POSSIBILITY
THE AIR IS GOOD
TO BE HALLMARKED
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONS HAPPENED
WHO WAS TROTSKY'S SECRETARY
ONE WAS HIS OWN CHILDHOOD IN AND AROUND CONISTON WATER
AND MEMORIES OF THAT
ALL THE WAY THROUGH FROM THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
BISHOPS ARE WEALTHY MEN
SOME OF THEM ARE QUITE INTO GAMBLING
BITS THIRD ROW HERE
THE SOCALLED GERMAN EMPIRE WAS THEN A YOUNG COUNTRY
THE OBSERVATORY WAS CROWDED WITH PEOPLE
AND A MINUTE SPENT ON A HOT STOVE SEEMED LIKE TWO HOURS
BUT I THINK SHE'S TELLING ME THAT FOR TEN YEARS SHE'S BEEN COMING HERE
AND ON THE BRO MOUNTAIN
I FIND MYSELF CLOSE TO THE ORIGINS OF QUEEN VICTORIA
THE BEST IN THE WORLD
AND THE RESTAURANTS
SOUNDS LIKE THE PLACE FOR ME
WE USED TO COOK IRON AND STEEL ON TWO
HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST INDUSTRIAL PIONEERS AND HE MADE GERMAN STEEL WHAT IT BECAME LATER ON
I NOW WANT TO DO SOMETHING WHICH
THIS PERFUME CREATED BY AN ITALIAN IN GERMANY
SO HE TRIED TO CREATE A PERFUME WHICH REMINDED HIM OF ITALY
AND NAPOLEON ACTUALLY HAD HIMSELF MADE SPECIAL BOOTS
I THINK IN GERMANY IT STARTED WITH THE REVOLUTION IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT
YOU SEE SO MANY CASTLES ON THE RHINE RIVER
HOW MANY ARE THERE
AND THAT WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO
YOUNG AND IT HAD A DIFFERENT DRIVE
IN THE MODERN WORLD
SHE'S GOT AN ABSCES
WHICH IS IRONIC
I DON'T HAVE TIME
SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T DO IT ALL IN A DAY
IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU
I GUESS I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY
AND I ADMIRE THAT
SHE WASN'T AFRAID
AND THAT'S ENOUGH
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS
SHOULD FERRARI MAKE CARS THAT EVERYONE CAN DRIVE
AND FOUR WHEEL DRIVE
IT'S JUST WONDERFUL
I WOULD SAY NINETY PERCENT OF THAT WAS
HERE'S A PUNCH THAT WON HIM THE BELT IN THIS FIRST PLACE
THIS IS THE BEST CAR OF ALL CARS
THEY'RE MINOR FLAWS
HERE'S A LITTLE TIP FOR YOU
DON'T GO WITH ONE OF THOSE OPEN TOP BUS TOURS
GO WITH TOP GEAR TOURS
HE REWROTE THE RULES SO IT BECAME ALL ABOUT BECOMING AS RICH AS POSSIBLE AND BANKRUPTING ALL THE
AND AT VARIOUS POINTS DURING THE GAME
BUT THEY WERE TAUGHT PRACTICAL SKILLS AS WELL
TWENTY FIVE THIRTY ON THE BO
ABOUT MAKING ART ABOUT REAL PEOPLE
THAT WONDERFUL SINGING BLUE
TO THE INTERNET BUYER THEN
THE ROHAHAN
UNDERNEATH IT SAID
YOU BREAK MY HEART
YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
THEY'RE NOT REALLY MY SORT OF THING
I'LL TAKE YOUR TEN
NOW WE'VE GOT THEM GOING
THIS ONE HAS BEEN MADE INTO A TRAY
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE MEN YOURSELF
SO IF HE BEATS ME AND HE DOES WELL
GET THAT BID OUT
THANK YOU SO MUCH
SIX ANYWHERE ELSE
THEY WERE USED AS SORT OF PERSUADERS
SHE LIKES YOU VERY MUCH
I'M THRILLED WITH THAT
AND ITS GOT THIS SORT OF GLOBE AT THE TOP
I HAVE JUST NOTICED
BUT IT DOES HAVE A BIG
THERE WAS ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING GOING ON HERE ALREADY
NOT JUST CHELMSFORD
THEY'VE GOT A VERY BIG
YOU VERY RAPIDLY
WE DON'T HAVE ANY
WE THINK OF AS AS PARTY PEOPLE GOOD
NEIGHBOURLY AND THEY HAVE MONEY
WE WANT YOUR COMPANIES TO PAY THE TAXES THAT THEY SHOULD PAY AND NOT JUST BE HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE
I MUST CALL MY FRIEND HE'S ON HOLIDAY IN CAPE FEAR
WHEN HE'S NOT HAVING HIS SEIZURES WHEN HE'S NOT REALLY BAD
SHE WANTS ATTENTION FROM BOTH OF US AND
AS MUCH AS WE TRY TO GIVE IT TO HER
THEY SO DESERVE
THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE
